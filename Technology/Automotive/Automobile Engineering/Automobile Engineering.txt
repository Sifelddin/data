NOTES OF GUIDANCE
Role of the media:
To equip a learner with vocabulary, particularly active vocabulary and standard everyday expressions
,using English dailies and watching selective English T.V. channels both in the classroom and outside the
classroom is focused. Such a provision is recommended for the students to establish familiarity with the
English dailies and selective English T.V. channels.
Minimum two copies of two English dailies in the laboratory room (students can bring their own copies
also).Minimum two systems with net connection for information collection in the laboratory itself.

Synopsis of the news item:
During every lab work day, students must choose a news item from the English daily or weekly or
monthly, and write a synopsis of the chosen news item, in not more than five lines. The news item should
be pasted on the left page and synopsis on the right page (the chosen news item should not be politically,
socially or communally controversial). Students should exercise care in choosing the news items.
Teachers have to advise them on this aspect. This can be done outside the class hours also but every
record exercise should begin with the synopsis of news item of the date of the lab session.
For example, first lab exercise namely departmental vocabulary and antakshari is performed on
15/12/2011. The student should choose a news item from any English daily of 15/10/2011 and record the
synopsis on the right page (in not more than 5 lines) under the caption Synopsis of the news item of
the day/date 15/10/2011.There is no harm in repeating or copying the lines form the passage. The
essence of the passage should be there. The cutout news item for presenting the synopsis should be
pasted on the left page of the record notebook.
This is to be done with interest for developing one’s personality. This work does not carry any
marks but without which the record exercise should not be valued. This is the precondition for valuing the
record exercise. Each record exercise follows the synopsis of the chosen news item.
At the bottom of the synopsis, the student should record the dictionary meaning of atleast one
strange word found in the chosen news item. At the end of every month, a minimum of 10 Headlines of
10 different days i.e. one Headline a day from anyone English daily should be pasted on the right or left
page of the Record Note Book. (This work does not carry marks but this is the precondition for marking
the record exercises)
External examiner, before signing the record notebook, should verify whether the Newspaper
works were recorded/pasted in the record notebook.
Verbal communication in any language begins with sounds in isolation, union and word formation.
Learning everyday words and expressions is the primary factor. Grammar comes next. One can enrich
one’s every day vocabulary by reading English magazines and listening to or watching an English channel
on television. So an English laboratory should be equipped with a minimum of two copies of two English
dailies and English weeklies or monthlies.
Watching English channels helps the students improve their vocabulary and expressions. If there
is a provision, students may be permitted to watch selective, mind corruption free English channels
(sports, education, news, animal channels and so on) for at least 15 min. during the English lab sessions.
This will serve as motivation for the students and help them shed their inhibition.

What is antakshari? (Polar word game)
This game can be played on the stage by two or three students using the departmental words. Suppose
Mr. A belongs to Dept.of Electrical and Electronics and he says his departmental word ‘ ampere ‘Mr. B
has to supply a word beginning with the ending letter of Mr. A’s word. The word ampere ends with the
letter ‘ e’ so Mr. B says ‘ electrical ‘.Mr. A has to continue with the letter ‘ l ’. Like that five pairs of words
are to be spoken.(Letter ending only, not sound ending. ) Suppose departmental words are not
available in some English letters like
‘ x ‘ ‘ y ‘ ‘ z ‘ the students may be permitted to use common words.

activity, forums like NCC,NSS, hobby, ambition, strengths and weaknesses.

Pl.note: Suppose departmental words are not available in some English letters like
‘ x ‘ ‘ y ‘ ‘ z ‘ the students may be permitted to use common words. This is only an example.

Another student of Mechanical Engineering can have different sets of words under each letter
of the English alphabet.Like that there may be variety of sets. The most important point is that
One is not supposed to murmur but speak the words intelligibly in an audible manner.
Swallowing the words will deprive a student of winning a selection in an interview. In the
same way, students of other Departments can have different sets of words of their
departments under each letter of the English alphabet.
