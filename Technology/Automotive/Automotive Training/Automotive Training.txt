How to become
an apprentice.
An apprenticeship is a great way to
combine structured training and paid
employment. You can begin while you’re
still at school in Years 11 or 12, or if you are
older than 15 years of age. You don’t need
a secondary school certificate to start
an apprenticeship, although this is highly
regarded by most employers.

Step 1: Preparation and research.

As an apprentice you will earn an income
while you are learning your trade. Your
work will combine study on the job or at
Kangan Institute. When you finish your
apprenticeship, you will have a nationally
recognised qualification and skills that can
take you anywhere in Australia and to many
overseas countries as well.

Step 2: Job hunting.

Figure out what trade you are interested
in, research job opportunities and write or
update your resume.
A pre-apprenticeship is a great way to get
a taste of a trade and the confidence to get
a job.

Start looking for jobs through networking
with people you know, applying online or by
contacting jobactive providers.

Step 3: Sign up.
Once you’ve found an employer, you both
must contact an AASN to sign a training
apprenticeship contract. Select Kangan
Institute as your preferred training provider
to get started.
If you are eligible for a Health Care Card,
make sure you apply for one prior to
enrolling so you are eligible for concession
fees.

Group Training Organisations (GTOs).
GTOs like WPC and VACC partner with a range of businesses and offer you expert advice
and assistance to find you the right apprenticeship. GTOs can not only place you with the
right business, they also monitor your progress and support you as you need it.

Australian Apprenticeship Support Network (AASN).
AASNs are contracted by the Government to support and facilitate the apprenticeship
process for employers and individuals. AASNs can also help you with the recruitment
process and provide mentoring and career advice.
