This book is part of the Cavendish Essential series. The books in the
series are designed to provide useful revision aids for the hard-pressed
student. They are not, of course, intended to be substitutes for more
detailed treatises. Other textbooks in the Cavendish portfolio must
supply these gaps.
Each book in the series follows a uniform format of a checklist of the
areas covered in each chapter, followed by expanded treatment of
‘Essential’ issues looking at examination topics in depth.
The team of authors bring a wealth of lecturing and examining
experience to the task in hand. Many of us can even recall what it was
like to face law examinations!

Duty of care

Duty situations
The tests for determining the existence of a duty of care have changed.
Prior to 1932, there were numerous incidents of liability for negligence
but there was no connecting principle formulated which could be regarded
as the basis of all of them. These were referred to as ‘duty situations’.
The ‘neighbour’ principle
The first attempt to create a rationale for all the discrete duty situations
was made by Brett MR in Heaven v Pender (1883), but the most important
formulation of a general principle is that of Lord Atkin in Donoghue v
Stevenson (1932). This is known as the ‘neighbour principle’:
You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you
can reasonably foresee are likely to injure your neighbour. Who,
then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be – persons
who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought
reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when
I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called
into question.

The ‘two stage’ test
The ‘neighbour principle’ is a test based on reasonable foresight and is
unquestionably too wide. It needed further defining.
In the 1970s, there were attempts to extend it by defining it as a general
principle. In Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd (1970), Lord Reid said ‘[the
neighbour principle] ought to apply unless there is some justification
or valid explanation for its exclusion’. This led to Lord Wilberforce’s
‘two stage’ test in the case of Anns v Merton LBC (1977):
First, one has to ask whether ... there is a sufficient relationship of
proximity ... in which case a prima facie duty arises. Secondly, if the
first question is answered affirmatively, it is necessary to consider
whether there are any policy considerations which ought to negative,
or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty.

Lord Wilberforce’s emphasis on prima facie duties led to a large potential
increase in the areas where a duty will be owed, particularly in the area
of economic loss. See Junior Books Ltd v Veitchi Co Ltd (1983). Note how

2

NEGLIGENCE

Lord Wilberforce uses this expression ‘proximity’, he equates it to
foreseeability, this approach has not been followed in more recent cases
and ‘proximity’ currently takes into account the type of situation and
policy.
Criticism of the ‘two stage’ test
Criticisms of the test were as follows:
•
•
•
•

policy and proximity are traditionally considered together;
the test obscured the difference between misfeasance and non-feasance;
the test involved too rapid an extension to the tort of negligence;
judges disliked the express consideration of policy.

The ‘three stage’ test
Lord Wilberforce’s general principle soon came in for heavy criticism.
This began with Lord Keith in Governors of the Peabody Donation Fund v
Sir Lindsay Parkinson & Co Ltd (1985) when he said that in addition to
proximity the court must decide whether it is ‘fair, just and reasonable’
to impose a duty of care.
The case of Murphy v Brentwood DC (1990) marked the death knell for
the ‘two stage’ test by overruling Anns. Murphy talked of adopting an
‘incremental’ approach to determining the existence of a duty of care.
Following the case of Caparo Industries plc v Dickman (1990), there is now
a ‘three stage’ test, with the following criteria being taken into account:
• reasonable foreseeability;
• proximity;
• is it ‘fair, just and reasonable’ to impose a duty?
The reaction against the ‘two stage’ test was primarily focused on the
fact that it created a massive extension to the tort of negligence. The
‘incremental’ approach avoids such an increase, instead, the tort of
negligence is developed by analogy with existing cases. Any novel type
of situation would have to show that it is analogous to an existing situation
where a duty is owed.
Policy considerations
Policy plays a vital role in determining the existence of a duty of care. It
can be defined as the departure from established legal principle for

3

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

pragmatic purposes. Cases such as Donoghue v Stevenson and Anns consider
policy expressly, whereas the approach followed in Caparo and Murphy
is to impliedly consider policy and merge it into other considerations
such as ‘proximity’ and whether it is ‘fair, just and reasonable’ to impose
a duty.
What issues of policy are commonly raised?
• To allow an action would open the ÔfloodgatesÕ and expose the defendant to
an indeterminate liability
The courts are always keen to limit liability to a determinate amount
to a determinate class of persons. For example, in Weller & Co v Foot
and Mouth Disease Research Institute (1986), the plaintiffs were auctioneers
who lost money on account of being unable to hold their auctions as
a result of the defendant’s negligence in allowing the foot and mouth
virus to escape, which lead to restrictions on the movement of cattle.
It was said by the court that their damage was ‘foreseeable’, but so
was the damage to ‘countless other enterprises’. It would have been
equally foreseeable that cafés, newsagents, etc, in the market town
would also lose money. The burden on one pair of defendant’s shoulders
would be insupportable and policy had to act to limit liability.
• The imposition of a duty would prevent the defendant from doing his job
properly
This leads to a class of what have been termed ‘protected parties’ –
persons who enjoy immunity from suit:
(a) judges and witnesses in judicial proceedings enjoy immunity on
grounds of ‘public policy’;
(b) barristers – it was held in Rondel v Worsley (1969) that barristers
were immune from civil action. It was further held in Saif Ali v
Sydney Mitchell and Co (1980) that the immunity extended to pretrial work. In Kelley v Corston (1997), the defendant, who was a
barrister advised the plaintiff to compromise a claim for ancillary
relief in divorce proceedings. The court later confirmed the settlement
as a consent order. The plaintiff subsequently sued the defendant
on the basis of negligent advice. The court held that the plaintiff’s
claim fell within the immunity extended to advocates;
(c) solicitors enjoy immunity when acting as advocates;

4

NEGLIGENCE

(d) there is a public policy immunity for the carrying out of public
duties by public bodies, unless that public body has assumed a
responsibility to the individual. It is thought that, to impose a
duty, in this situation, would interfere with the way in which
public bodies carry out their tasks. The immunity originates with
the case of Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire (1989). The mother
of the last victim of the Yorkshire Ripper sought to sue the police
for negligence in failing to apprehend him earlier. There was found
to be no special relationship between the police and the victim
and consequently no duty could arise. It was felt that to impose
a duty would be damaging to police operations. They would
deploy their resources defensively on the basis of how they could
best avoid civil liability, rather than on the basis of their professional
judgment.
This immunity was held to apply in the case of Osman v Ferguson
(1992), even where it was known to the police that the plaintiff
was being harassed by an identified individual. A school teacher
had become obsessed with one of his pupils. He had threatened
to do a ‘thing like the Hungerford massacre’ because of the obsession.
Complaints had been made by the plaintiff’s family to the police.
The same individual eventually shot and injured the plaintiff and
also killed his father but there was no duty on grounds of public
policy immunity.
However, the police may be liable where there is a special relationship
between the police and an informant (Swinney v Chief Constable of
Northumbria Police (1996)). The police do not have a blanket immunity,
there are other considerations of public policy which also carry
weight. Hirst LJ gave examples such as the need to protect springs
of information, to protect informers, and to encourage them to
come forward without an undue fear of the risk that their identity
will become known to the suspect or to his associates. The facts
of the case were that the plaintiff passed on to the police certain
information concerning the unlawful killing of a police officer.
The suspect was known to be violent. The informant requested
that contact with her be made in confidence. The document
containing the information supplied together with the informant’s
name was left in an unattended police car. The vehicle was broken
into and the suspect obtained the document. It was arguable that
a special relationship existed.

5

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

The House of Lords held that a policewoman who alleged that
the defendant commissioner had been negligent in failing to prevent
her victimisation by fellow officers had an arguable case in Waters
v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (2000). The claimant had
complained to her superior of a sexual assault by a fellow officer.
Afterwards, her fellow officers reviled her for having made the
complaint. The public policy immunity did not apply. The claimant
was not suing as a member of the public. Lord Halton said it was
in the public interest to allow the claim; otherwise, citizens would
be discouraged from joining the police.
The immunity also did not arise in Welton v North Cornwall DC
(1996). An environmental health officer, acting on behalf of a local
authority, negligently required the owner of food premises to
undertake extensive works to comply with the Food Act 1990. It
was argued that the officer exercised a police or quasi-police
function and there should be an immunity. This was rejected as
the officer had assumed responsibility and hence a duty of care
was owed.
The same public policy immunity for the discharge of public duties,
unless responsibility had exceptionally been assumed to a particular
defendant, also applies to the Crown Prosecution Service (ElguzouliDaf v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (1994)) and the fire
brigade (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Great Britain) v
Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence Authority (1996); John Munroe (Acrylics)
Ltd v London Fire and Civil Defence Authority (1996); Nelson Holdings
Ltd v British Gas plc (1996)). However, a distinction was made
between a positive act of negligence for which there would be
liability on the part of the fire brigade and a negligent omission
for which there would be no liability in Capital Counties plc v
Hampshire CC (1997). Latter Days Saints and Munroe were preferred
in Nelson.
The public policy immunities have recently been scrutinised by
the European Court of Human Rights in Osman v UK (1998). A
challenge was made under Arts 2, 6 and 8 of the European Convention
on Human Rights. The case arose out of the facts of Osman v
Ferguson (see above). Article 2 protects right to life; Art 6 protects
the right to justice and Art 8 provides for respect for private and
family life. There was held to be no breach of Art 2 as the State
was not in breach of its positive obligation to take preventative
measures to protect an individual whose life was at risk from

6

NEGLIGENCE

another. The police did not know or ought to have known that
there was a threat to life. For similar reasons, there was no breach
of Art 8.
There was a breach of Art 6(1). The exclusionary rule which
prevented a full hearing of the applicant’s case laid down in Hill
constituted a disproportionate interference with a person’s right
to have a determination on the merits of an action and prevented
the court from considering competing interests.
• It is against public policy to claim that you should not have been born (McKay
v Essex AHA (1982))
• The courts will not impose a duty where there is an alternative system of
compensation
See Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire, where compensation was
payable under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. However,
the existence of an alternative remedy will not exclude liability, if the
elements of foreseeability and proximity are present (Langley v Dray
(1998)).
• Constitutional relationship between Parliament and the courts
The courts are reluctant to impose a duty where none existed before,
as they see this as the constitutional role of Parliament.
Duty in fact
The issue of the existence of a duty will only arise in novel cases or where
it is sought to overrule an existing precedent against liability. This is
referred to as a ‘notional duty’ and looks at the question from an abstracted
level.
In most cases, it will be a question of fact, whether the defendant
owes the plaintiff a duty of care on the particular facts of the case. This
is referred to as a ‘duty in fact’. The existence of that particular duty is
not in issue, what is in issue is whether a duty is owed in that particular
case. For example, Bourhill v Young (1942), where it was held that the
plaintiff was not foreseeable.

Particular aspects of the duty of care
Physical injury
The meaning of the term ‘proximity’ varies according to who is using
the term, when it is being used and the type of injury that has been
suffered. As far as physical injury is concerned, the courts will readily
7

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

hold the parties to be proximate and for this type of injury proximity
really equates to foreseeability. In examination questions where the
problem revolves around physical injury, it is unlikely that the examiner
is requiring detailed consideration of the tests required for a duty of
care but the problem will revolve around some other aspect of negligence.
However, the House of Lords has held in Marc Rich & Co AG v Bishop
Rock Marine Co Ltd (1995) that, even in cases of physical damage, the
court had to consider not only foreseeability and proximity, but also
whether it was fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty.
The third requirement of ‘fair, just and reasonableness’ was lacking
in Mulcahy v Ministry of Defence (1996). The plaintiff was a soldier serving
with the British army in the Gulf War. He was injured and his hearing
was affected when his gun commander negligently ordered a gun to be
fired. Two of the components of a duty of care – foreseeability and
proximity – were found to be present. However, taking into account the
circumstances including the position and role of the alleged tortfeasor
and relevant policy considerations, it was not fair, just and reasonable
to impose a duty.
An unusual case of negligence causing physical injury is Revill v Newbery
(1995). The plaintiff, who was a trespasser and was engaged in criminal
activities, was attempting to break into a brick shed on the defendant’s
allotment. The defendant poked a shotgun through a small hole in the
door and fired, injuring the plaintiff. The defendant was found to be
negligent and had exceeded the level of violence justified in self-defence.
The plaintiff, however, was found to be two-thirds contributorily negligent.
In the Marc Rich case, Lord Steyn drew a distinction between ‘directly
inflicted physical loss’ and ‘indirectly inflicted physical loss’. He said
that the law would more readily impose liability for the former than the
latter. The defendants unsuccessfully attempted to rely on this distinction
in Perrett v Collins (1998). One of the defendants had inspected a light
aircraft and certified that it was airworthy. The other defendant was the
certifying authority. They were held to owe a duty of care to the plaintiff
who was a passenger in a test flight. The Court of Appeal said that the
distinction was more relevant to economic loss and was not germane to
physical injury. The test would be applied in novel categories and did
not apply to established categories of liability for personal injury.

NEGLIGENCE

Rescuers
Rescuers as plaintiff

The law does not oblige a person to undertake a rescue, unless they are
in a special relationship, but the courts are favourably disposed to
someone who does attempt a rescue and is injured in the process. Like
physical injury the courts require very little more than foreseeability
before they hold the parties proximate.
The courts have held that where the defendant has negligently created
a situation of danger, it is foreseeable that someone will attempt a rescue
and it will not be possible for the defendant to argue that the rescuer is
volenti non fit injuria or constitutes a novus actus interveniens (Haynes v
Harwood (1935)); Baker v TE Hopkins & Son Ltd (1958)).
As far as rescuers are concerned, the courts are quick to regard someone
as being foreseeable and impose few conditions in declaring the parties
proximate. However, there must be a real threat of danger (Cutler v United
Dairies (London) Ltd (1983)). The plaintiff attempted a rescue when no one
was in a situation of danger and was consequently not owed a duty.
However, even if the victim was not in actual danger, the defendant
will owe a duty if the rescuer’s perception of danger was a reasonable
one (Ould v ButlerÕ s Wharf Ltd (1953)).
The duty owed to a rescuer is independent from that owed to the
accident victim. The defendant may, therefore, owe a duty to the rescuer
where none is owed to the accident victim (Videan v British Transport
Commission (1963)).
If someone negligently imperils himself or his property, it is foreseeable
that there may be an attempt at a rescue and a duty of care will arise on
the part of the accident victim. This includes a duty of care to a professional
rescuer, such as a fireman (Ogwo v Taylor (1987)).
Professional rescuers were also the subject of Frost v Chief Constable
of South Yorkshire (1996). The case arose out of the Hillsborough disaster.
The plaintiffs were police officers, four of whom were at the ground at
the time of the tragedy, but their roles differed. Three of the four were
found to be rescuers. A fifth officer who was not on duty at the ground
but reported to a hospital later in the afternoon and helped in mortuary
duties was not found to be a rescuer and her claim was dismissed. All
five officers had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and claimed in
nervous shock. The claims of civilian relatives of victims for nervous
shock damages had been dismissed in Alcock v Chief Constable of South
Yorkshire (1992). Despite the fact that both cases arose out of the same
incident, the four officers who were present at the ground succeeded in

9

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Frost. The three officers who were classed as rescuers were owed a duty
in two capacities: in their first capacity as rescuers and in their second
capacity as employees of the defendant. The fourth officer present at
the ground was owed a duty as he was the defendant’s employee.
In Duncan v British Coal Corporation (1997), the plaintiff was 275 metres
from a colleague when he was crushed to death. He was contacted over
the telephone and arrived at the scene of the accident within four minutes
and administered first aid. He was held not to be a rescuer.
Rescuers as defendant

Although rescuers are quickly held to be owed a duty, there are situations
where a rescuer himself can owe a duty to the accident victim. For
example, where the rescuer by his conduct in commencing a rescue
deters or prevents others from attempting a rescue, on the principle of
‘detrimental reliance’ (Zelenko v Gimbel Bros (1935)). There is Canadian
authority for saying that where a rescuer worsens the condition of the
accident victim, then the rescuer becomes liable to the accident victim
(Horsley v MacLaren (1970)). There is no duty at large to help someone
in need of urgent assistance. However, when an ambulance service
accepts a 999 call, a duty will be owed if the patient is identified by name
and address (Kent v Griffiths (No 3) (2000)). Unlike other public services,
only the patient’s welfare is at issue and there is no conflict of priorities
in imposing a duty as there is with the police force; consequently,
foreseeability and proximity are made out.
A police officer is under a duty to go to the assistance of a colleague
who is under attack (Costello v Chief Constable of Northumbria (1998)).
Contributory negligence and rescuers

The courts are reluctant to hold rescuers contributorily negligent, for
example, Harrison v British Railways Board (1981) but, if a rescuer has
been contributorily negligent, damages will be reduced accordingly
(Sayers v Harlow UDC (1958)).
Omissions
The law makes a distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance.
There is liability for the former but not for the latter. In other words,
there is no liability for omissions. A can watch B drown in an inch of
water and incur no legal liability, unless A stands in a special relationship
to B. However, if you start off a chain of events and then omit to do

10

NEGLIGENCE

something, for example, begin driving a car and then omit to brake, with
the result that you knock someone down, then there will be liability.
Liability for acts of third parties

Similarly, you cannot be held liable for the acts of third parties, unless
there is a special relationship with that third party. In P Perl (Exporters)
Ltd v Camden LBC (1984), thieves gained entry into the defendant’s flat
and were then able to break into the plaintiff’s property. It was accepted
that the damage was foreseeable but there was no obligation on the part
of the defendants to prevent the harm from occurring. Perl was followed
in the case of King v Liverpool CC (1986). In this case, the defendants left
their property vacant and unprotected, with the result that vandals
gained entrance, damaging the plaintiff’s flat. The defendants were held
not to be responsible for the acts of the vandals. What particularly
troubled the court was the question of what would be the extent of the
defendant’s obligation, if he was obliged to protect his property. Would
it have to be put under 24 hour guard, etc?
In Smith v Littlewoods Organisation Ltd (1987), it was held that the
defendant could be responsible for the acts of third parties if ‘special
circumstances’ existed, as follows:
• a ‘special relationship’ between plaintiff and defendant;
• a source of danger was negligently created by the defendant and it
was reasonably foreseeable that third parties would interfere;
• the defendant had a knowledge or means of knowledge that a third
party had created or was creating a risk of danger on his property
and failed to take reasonable steps to abate it.
On the facts of Littlewoods, the damage was not reasonably foreseeable,
so the defendants were not liable. There was a difference in approach
between the judges. Lord Goff saw the intervention of a third party as a
novus actus interveniens which ‘breaks the chain of causation’. Lord Mackay,
on the other hand, did not see the question in terms of remoteness and
causation but in terms of fault. He felt that a third party intervention
does not absolve the defendant from liability but in most cases the chances
of harm being caused by a third party are slim, therefore, it is not reasonable
to expect the defendant to take precautions against the harm occurring.
Lord Goff’s view is preferred by most academic writers and was
followed by the Court of Appeal in Topp v London Country Buses (South
West) Ltd (1993). An employee of the defendant bus company habitually
left his bus unlocked with the key in the ignition. After a short interval,
a relief driver would drive the bus away. On the day in question, the

11

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

relief driver failed to turn up and some time later the bus was stolen by
joyriders who knocked down and killed the plaintiff’s wife. The Court
of Appeal held that no duty of care arose. Arguably, if Lord Mackay’s
test had been used, then the plaintiff would have succeeded as the trial
judge had found the defendant’s actions to be careless.
Nervous shock or psychiatric injury
The courts have been slow to allow claims for nervous shock unless they
are coupled with physical injury to the plaintiff. There are many criteria
that the plaintiff must satisfy before there is liability for nervous shock.
Primary victims
The law of negligence relating to nervous shock makes an important
distinction between primary and secondary victims. Primary victims
are those who have been directly involved in the accident and are within
the range of foreseeable physical injury. In the case of secondary victims
who are not within the range foreseeable physical injury, certain control
mechanisms are put in place to limit the number of claimants to avoid
an opening of the floodgates. These principles are derived from a decision
by the House of Lords in Page v Smith (1995). The plaintiff suffered from
myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome or
post-viral fatigue syndrome. In the eyes of the law, this is regarded as a
psychiatric injury. The plaintiff was physically uninjured in a collision
between his car and a car driven by the defendant but his condition
became chronic and permanent, as a result of the accident. Secondary
victims are required to show that injury by way of nervous shock had
to be foreseeable (Bourhill v Young (1943); King v Phillips (1953)).
In Page v Smith, the collision was relatively minor and nervous shock
was not foreseeable. Nevertheless, the plaintiff recovered as a result of
the foreseeability of physical injury, even though the plaintiff was not
actually physically injured. Lord Lloyd felt that to enquire whether the
plaintiff was actually physically injured introduces hindsight into the
question of foreseeability, which has no part to play with primary victims.
However, hindsight was a legitimate consideration with secondary
victims. Lord Lloyd also felt that there was no justification for introducing
a distinction between physical and psychiatric illness, at least as far as
primary victims are concerned.
Lord Keith, in a dissenting judgment, felt that the injury had to belong
to a class or character that was foreseeable.

12

NEGLIGENCE

Rescuers and employees were classed as primary victims in Frost v
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire (1996). It was held in White v Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire (1999) that an employer is not under an
obligation to protect employees from psychiatric harm unless the employer
has breached a duty to protect employees from physical harm.
In Hunter v British Coal Corporation (1998), Brooke LJ identified three
categories of ‘primary victim’:
• those who fear injury to themselves;
• rescuers of the injured;
• those who believe they are or about to be, or have been, the involuntary
cause of another’s death or injury.

Medically recognised psychiatric illness or disorder

Before there can be liability for secondary victims, there must be a
medically recognised psychiatric illness or medical disorder, there is no
liability for emotional distress or grief unless this leads to a recognisable
medical condition these have been held to include:
• depression (Chadwick v British Transport Commission (1967));
• personality change (McLoughlin v OÕBrian (1983));
• post-traumatic stress disorder (Hale v London Underground (1992)).

13

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

It was held in Hicks v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire (1992) that there
could be no claim for the terror suffered immediately before death for
the knowledge that death was imminent. An abnormally sensitive plaintiff
will be unable to recover unless a person of ‘normal’ fortitude would
have suffered.
The distinction between grief and a recognised psychiatric condition
was again discussed in Vernon v Bosley (No 1) (1996). The plaintiff was
found to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), complicated
by a grief reaction. While PTSD is recoverable because it is a recognised
psychiatric condition, grief is not compensatable. It was held by a majority
that although the rules of nervous shock limit the number of potential
claimants, they do not limit the compensation to those who are owed a
duty of care. Even though part of the injury was attributable to grief,
damages were recoverable in full.
Additional criteria

In addition to the above, there are other criteria that the secondary victim
will have to satisfy before the plaintiff can recover for nervous shock:
• proximity in terms of relationship – the plaintiff must be in a close
and loving relationship with the accident victim (rescuers are an
exception to this rule);
• proximity in terms of time and space – the plaintiff must be at the
scene of the accident, in the vicinity of the accident or have come
across the ‘immediate aftermath’ of the accident;
• reasonable foreseeability – the plaintiff’s injuries must have been
reasonably foreseeable;
• there must have been a direct perception of the accident by the plaintiff
with the plaintiff’s own ‘unaided senses’;
• sudden shock – the illness must have been caused by a sudden shock.
Proximity in terms of relationship
Own safety

Initially, the law only allowed recovery where the plaintiff had been put
in fear of his own safety (Dulieu v White (1901)). Note the rules which
now relate to primary victims (Page v Smith, above). The plaintiff in
McFarlane v EE Caledonia Ltd (1994) was on a support vessel at the Piper
Alpha disaster. At first instance, it was held that he could recover even
though he was not a person of reasonable fortitude, as he had feared for
his own safety. This was overturned by the Court of Appeal. Stuart-

14

NEGLIGENCE

Smith LJ said that to claim for your own safety the plaintiff would have
to be:
• in the actual area of danger;
• while not in the area of actual danger, because of the sudden and
unexpected nature of the event, the plaintiff reasonably thinks he is;
• while not originally in the area of danger, the plaintiff is involved
later, that is, a rescuer.
In McFarlane v Wilkinson (1997), the plaintiff was on a vessel close to the
Piper Alpha disaster, but could not be classed as a primary victim. The
vessel was close to danger, but never actually in danger.
Fear for the safety of others

Eventually, the law was extended so that recovery was allowed where
the plaintiff feared for the safety of others. Hambrook v Stokes (1925) is
authority for this proposition, although it should be noted that this is a
difficult case and evidence was adduced that the plaintiff had feared for
her own safety.
Close and loving relationship

In Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire (1991), it was held by the
House of Lords that the plaintiff had to be in a ‘close and loving relationship’
with the accident victim. This approach rejected an earlier approach by
the Court of Appeal which tried to put a restriction on the amount of
claims by limiting claimants to specific categories, such as parents and
spouses.
Nervous shock caused through damage to property

The cases looked at so far have concentrated on nervous shock following
the negligent infliction of personal injury on a loved one. Claims have
been allowed for damage to property as well as physical injury. The
Court of Appeal in Attia v British Gas (1988) allowed for nervous shock
after the plaintiff witnessed her house burning down as a result of the
defendant’s negligence in installing central heating.
Rescuers and employees

Rescuers are an exception to the rule that claimants for nervous shock
have to be in a ‘close and loving relationship’ with the accident victim.
In Chadwick v British Railways Board (1967), the plaintiff was a passer-by
who assisted at the scene of a rail disaster. He did not know the accident
victims, but was able to recover. In Hale v London Underground (1992), a
professional rescuer, a fireman, was awarded damages for nervous shock.

15

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Professional rescuers were again allowed to recover in Frost v Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire (1996). The case was another Hillsborough
stadium disaster case. The five plaintiffs were police officers, four of
whom were present at the ground and the fifth discharged mortuary
duties at a local hospital following the disaster. Three out of the five
plaintiffs were classed as rescuers and were able to recover damages for
their psychiatric injuries, on that basis. In addition, as the disaster was
caused by the negligence of their employer the four officers present at
the ground were owed duties in their capacity as employees from their
employer. They were at the scene as a matter of obligation. The fifth
officer was not owed a duty, as she was neither a rescuer nor at the
ground when the negligence occurred. A majority of the Court of Appeal
held that rescuers and employees are primary and not secondary victims.
This explains the discrepancy between this case and Alcock, where relatives
of the victims of the disaster did not succeed as they lacked sufficient
proximity. Frost can also be distinguished from McFarlane v EE Caledonia
Ltd, as in the latter case the employee was off duty and consequently
not owed a duty by his employer, he was not under an obligation to be
at the scene of the Piper Alpha disaster.
Judge LJ, in a dissenting judgment, held that all employees and all
rescuers could not be classed in fixed categories as primary and secondary
victims. The classification should depend on the facts of the case.
An employee is a ‘primary victim’ when exposed to the risk of physical
injury caused by a colleague and is ‘directly involved’ as a participant
in an incident (Scholfield v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire (1998)).
The House of Lords held in White v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
(1999) that an employer is not under an obligation to protect employees
from psychiatric harm unless the employer has breached a duty to protect
employees from physical harm. A rescuer who was not himself exposed
to physical risk was a secondary victim.
But, rescuers who are employees may be successful in claims for
psychiatric injury if the employer fails to provide counselling after the
traumatic event. This was suggested in Leach v Chief Constable of
Gloucestershire (1999) and the argument is being pursued by two
policewomen who attended the aftermath of the Dunblane massacre.
Proximity in terms of time and space

Initially, the plaintiff had to be at the scene of the accident to be able to
recover for nervous shock. In Bourhill v Young (1943), the plaintiff was
50 yards from the scene of the accident which she could hear but could
not see and was held to be insufficiently proximate. Similarly, in King v

16

NEGLIGENCE

Phillips (1953), the defendant was a taxi driver who negligently ran over
a boy’s tricycle. The plaintiff was the boy’s mother who witnessed the
accident from a distance of 70 yards. It was held that she was insufficiently
proximate to the scene of the accident.
However, a change can be detected in the courts’ attitude in the case
of Boardman v Sanderson (1964), where the plaintiff who again heard but
was not present at the scene of the accident was able to recover.
In McLoughlin v OÕBrian (1981), the plaintiff was two miles from the
accident but rushed to the hospital to see her family prior to them
receiving medical treatment and was held to be sufficiently proximate.
She had come across the ‘immediate aftermath’ of the accident.
In Jaensch v Coffey (1984), the plaintiff who saw her husband in hospital
in a serious condition after he had been injured, succeeded in her claim
for nervous shock.
In Duncan v British Coal Corporation (1997), a plaintiff who was 275
metres away from the scene of the accident and arrived at the scene four
minutes later but saw no injury or blood was not sufficiently proximate
in terms of time and space.
Reasonable foreseeability

In Bourhill v Young, the plaintiff did not recover as she was not regarded
as being reasonably foreseeable. Two views formed as to the true ratio
of the case. The first view holds that the defendant must be at the scene
of the accident. The second view states that injury by way of psychiatric
injury must be foreseeable. The latter view is now taken as the test for
foreseeability – the defendant should be able to foresee injury by way
of nervous shock.
Direct perception

In McLoughlin v OÕBrian, certain policy issues came to the fore. Lord
Wilberforce felt that there was a need to set some limit on the extent of
liability and it was therefore necessary to limit claims where there had
been a direct perception of the accident with the plaintiff’s own unaided
senses. Lord Bridge, however, did not see the necessity of setting such
an arbitrary limit on claims.
For several years after McLoughlin v OÕBrian, there was considerable
uncertainty as to the state of the law. In Hevican v Ruane (1991), the
plaintiff saw his son’s dead body some time after he died, without coming
across the ‘immediate aftermath’ of the accident. Similarly, at first instance,
in Ravenscroft v Rederiaktiebolaget (1991), the claim of a mother who did
not come across the ‘immediate aftermath’ was initially allowed.

17

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Alcock settled the fact that it had to be a direct perception of the
accident with the plaintiff ’s own unaided senses. Ravenscroft v
Rederiaktiebolaget was, as a result, overturned on appeal.
Sudden shock

There must be a sudden shock. This requirement has been doubted in
a dissenting judgment by Sir Thomas Bingham MR in M v Newham LBC
(1994).
Policy or principle?

The policy limitations on the rights of secondary victims to recover have
caused many arbitrary distinctions and much dissatisfaction with the
law relating to nervous shock. Why was it possible for the police officers
present at the Hillsborough disaster to recover (Frost) but not relatives
of the victims (Alcock)? Why can an employee present at the scene of
disaster recover (Frost) but not an off duty employee similarly present
at the scene of disaster (McFarlane v EE Caledonia Ltd)? What is the
difference between coming onto the immediate aftermath of the accident
(McLoughlin v OÕBrian ) and hearing about the accident and seeing its
consequences sometime later (Ravenscroft v Rederiaktiebolaget)?
Policy limitations have caused great uncertainty as to the state of the
law. They are thought necessary, as without them the floodgates would
open. There is evidence to suggest that this assumption is not justified.
Legislation in New South Wales allowed a parent or spouse to recover
for nervous shock, without the requirement that there be proximity in
terms of time and space. No flood of litigation followed.
Murphy (1995) argues that the three stage test should be replicated
throughout negligence. There would be no sharp divergence between
the treatment of primary and secondary victims and the same tests would
be applied. He argues that the actual result would not differ much from
the outcome of the decided authorities, as it would still be harder for
those who are currently classed as secondary victims to satisfy the
proximity stage of the test.
An alternative is to legislate in this area.
Proposals for reform

The Law Commission in its report, Liability for Psychiatric Illness, has
recommended reform. It felt that there should be a statutory ‘duty of
care’. It would leave the rule in Page v Smith unaffected, but would
otherwise require reasonable foreseeability of psychiatric illness as a
result of death, injury or imperilment of a person with whom the plaintiff

18

NEGLIGENCE

had a close tie of love and affection, regardless of proximity in terms of
time and space. Furthermore, the plaintiff would no longer be required
to perceive the accident with his own unaided senses. When proving
proximity in terms of love and affection, there would be a fixed set of
relationships covered by the statutory duty of care. This would include
the following categories of relationship:
• spouse;
• parent;
• child;
• brother or sister (but not stepbrothers and sisters);
• cohabitees of at least two years standing (including same sex
relationships).
Anyone not included on the list would have to prove close ties of love
and affection. The statutory duty would not be imposed if it was not
‘just and reasonable’.
Economic loss
The law of negligence does not give the same level of protection to economic
interests as it does to physical interests. There are only three types of
situations where recovery is allowed in negligence for economic loss:
• economic loss which is consequential upon physical damage;
• negligent mis-statements;
• other special relationships.
Economic loss which is consequential upon physical damage

It is long established that economic loss as a result of physical injury is
recoverable not only for the cost of repairing physical damage to people
or property but also for ‘consequential’ loss of earnings or profits during
convalescence or repair.
Much stricter controls apply in relation to ‘commercial losses’. Recovery
was not allowed in Weller v Foot and Mouth DRI even though the damage
was foreseeable as damage was also foreseeable to ‘countless other
enterprises’.
In Spartan Steel & Alloys v Martin & Co (Contractors) Ltd (1973), the
defendant negligently cut off electricity to the defendant’s factory.
Damages for the cost of molten metal which was thrown away were
recoverable, since it was consequential upon physical damage, but loss

19

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

of profits while electricity was cut off were not recoverable as they were
purely commercial profits.
This area was greatly affected by the application of the Anns test. In
Junior Books v Veitchi Co Ltd (1983), recovery was allowed for economic
loss in a situation where liability had not been held to exist before. The
defendants were sub-contractors and flooring specialists and had been
nominated by the plaintiffs who had employed the main contractors.
The floor was negligently laid and the plaintiffs claimed loss of profits
for the period when the floor had to be re-laid. Applying the Anns test it
was held that the damage was recoverable. This promised to open up a
whole new field of claims for economic loss and Junior Books has not been
followed in subsequent cases, although it has not been formally overruled.
The House of Lords found it particularly significant that the sub-contractors
had been nominated by the plaintiffs and it was felt that this was sufficient
to create a relationship of ‘proximity’.
This has become known as the ‘high water’ mark of economic loss.
The courts have since returned to the traditional test. For example, in
Muirhead v Industrial Tank Specialities Ltd (1985), the plaintiffs who had
suffered loss because their lobsters had been killed due to defective
motors on a tank could only recover the cost of the lobsters and repairs
to the tank, they could not recover for loss of profits. This case has clear
echos of Spartan Steel. This trend was confirmed by the case of Leigh and
Sillivan v Aliakmon Shipping (1986), which again held that it was not
possible to recover economic losses arising from negligent misconduct.
Negligent mis-statements

So far we have looked at liability for negligent acts, the situation is very
different when it comes to statements which cause economic loss. One
difficulty is that statements may be made on an informal occasion and
may be passed on without the consent of the speaker.
Special relationship

The major development in this area came in the case of Hedley Byrne &
Co Ltd v Heller & Partners (1964). The House of Lords held that where
there was a ‘special relationship’ between the maker of a statement and
the receiver of a statement then there could be liability for the economic
loss caused. In this particular case, there was no liability as there had
been a disclaimer attached to the statement, so there had not been a
‘voluntary assumption of responsibility’.
The Privy Council in Mutual Life and CitizensÕ Assurance Co Ltd v Evatt
(1971) attempted to limit the scope of Hedley Byrne by stating that it only
applied in respect of advice given in the course of a business and where

20

NEGLIGENCE

the defendant made it clear that he was claiming some special skill or
competence. However, there was a minority view rejecting this approach.
That attempt has not been followed since and the special relationship
has been drawn more liberally. It became clear in Howard Marine &
Dredging Co Ltd v Ogden (1978) that there had to be considered advice
which someone would act upon. Liability would not extend to off-thecuff information. So, in Esso Petroleum v Mardon (1976), the defendants
were liable even though they were not in the business of giving financial
advice but they did have experience and special skill and knowledge
compared to the plaintiffs. While in Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd
(1994), there was liability for advice given under a contract. In Holt v
Payne Skillington (1995), it was held that the duty under Hedley Byrne
could be greater than that in contract.
The Privy Council in Royal Bank Trust Co (Trinidad) Ltd v Pampellone
(1987) made a distinction between passing on information and the giving
of advice. In Chaudhry v Prabhakar (1988), liability was imposed when
the statement was made on a social occasion but the defendant had
specialist knowledge compared to the plaintiff.
Reliance

There must be reliance on the statement by the plaintiff. Take, for example,
Smith v Eric S Bush and Harris v Wyre Forest DC (1990), two appeals heard
together by the House of Lords. In the first case, the plaintiff had applied
to a building society for a mortgage and was required to pay for a
valuation to be done on the property by the defendants for the building
society. It was known by the defendants that the valuation would be
shown to the plaintiff and that it would form the basis of her decision
as to whether she would buy the property. The valuation contained a
disclaimer that the defendants would not be liable in the event of any
negligence. Lord Templeman said that the relationship was ‘akin to
contract’ and liability was imposed. In contrast to Hedley Byrne, this case
was decided after the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the disclaimer
failed the reasonableness test. The statement had been used for the
purpose for which it was intended.
In the second case, the valuation had been carried out by the local
authority. The valuation had not been shown to the plaintiff and it also
contained a disclaimer, the defendants were still found to be liable.
However, it was possible for a firm of estate agents to rely on a
disclaimer in property particulars as against the purchaser of a property
in McCullagh v Lane Fox and Partners Ltd (1995). The purchaser had not,
in that case, been reasonably entitled to believe that the estate agent at
the time of making the statement was assuming responsibility for it. The

21

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

inclusion of a disclaimer put the matter beyond doubt, nor did the Unfair
Contract Terms Act 1977 preclude the estate agent from relying on the
disclaimer.
It was held in Hemmens v Wilson Browne (1993) that it could not be
reasonable to rely on a statement where a solicitor had advised his client’s
mistress to obtain independent legal advice before executing a document.
In addition to reliance there must be knowledge by the maker of the
statement, that the recipient will rely on the statement to his detriment.
Both requirements were satisfied in Welton v North Cornwall DC (1996).
An environmental health officer negligently required the owner of food
premises to comply with the Food Act 1990, by making unnecessary
substantial building works and major alterations to the kitchen. He also
threatened to close the business down, if the works were not completed.
The officer knew that what he said would be relied on by the plaintiffs
without independent inquiry and he visited to inspect and approved
the works being carried out. The fact that the relationship arose out of
the purported exercise of statutory functions did not give rise to an
immunity on the part of the local authority. It was not necessary to
consider whether it was fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty, as
the case did not involve an incremental extension to the Hedley Byrne
principle.
The test for reasonable reliance on a personal assumption of responsibility
was held to be an objective one by the House of Lords in Williams v
Natural Life Health Foods Ltd (1998). There could be no liability on the
part of the defendant in this case. He was the Managing Director and
principal shareholder in a company which had attempted to sell a
franchise to the plaintiff. The defendant had contributed to a brochure,
which the plaintiff had relied upon, but there had been no personal
dealings between the plaintiff and defendant. This absence of personal
dealings means that the plaintiff could not have gained the impression
that there was a voluntary assumption of responsibility on the part of
the defendant. However, a conscious assumption of responsibility was
found to be too stringent a test in Electra Private Equity Partners v KPMG
Peat Marwick (1999).
Purpose

The courts will take into account the purpose for which the statement
was made. In Caparo Industries plc v Dickman, the plaintiffs were shareholders
in a company and, as such, were entitled to annual audited accounts.
On the basis of these accounts, they launched a take-over bid in the
company before discovering that the accounts had been negligently
audited and had wrongly shown the company to be profit making. The

22

NEGLIGENCE

plaintiffs sued the auditors who were found not to be liable. The annual
audited accounts were the fulfilment of a statutory obligation, the purpose
of which was to enable the shareholders to take decisions about the
management of the company, it was not intended to be the basis of an
investment decision.
There have been other cases concerning annual audited accounts,
such as Al Saudi Banque v Pixley (1989) where auditors did not owe a
duty to a bank which had advanced money to a company on the basis
of annual audited accounts and Al Nakib Investments v Longcroft (1990)
where accounts were provided to existing shareholders to encourage
them to buy additional shares in a rights issue but the plaintiffs used
the accounts as the basis of a decision to buy additional shares on the
stock market and were consequently held not to be owed a duty.
Similarly, in Mariola Marine Corporation v LloydÕ s Register of Shipping
(The Morning Watch) (1990), there was no liability where the survey of
a ship had been carried out for the purposes of a health and safety
inspection when the results of the survey had been used as the basis of
a decision to purchase a ship.
A duty of care was owed by a managing agent to future Lloyds’ names
in Aitken v Stewart Wrightson Members Agency Ltd (1995), even though
the managing agent had not acted for those names at the time of the
reference.
Inequality of bargaining power

It was suggested in Morgan Crucible v Hill Samuel (1991) by Hoffman J
that the difference between Smith v Bush and Caparo v Dickman was that
in the former the plaintiff was in a weak financial position and was
absolutely dependent on the advice she received from the valuer, whereas
in Caparo the plaintiff was a large company with access to its own legal
and accountancy advice. It was therefore necessary to take into account
the extent to which it was reasonable for the plaintiff to rely on the advice.
This approach was doubted in the case of McNaughton Papers Group v
Hicks Anderson (1991) by the Court of Appeal.
Negligent statements relied upon by a third party

An employee who gives a negligent reference about an employee to a
prospective employer owes a duty not only to the prospective employer
but also to the employee. In Spring v Guardian Assurance plc (1994), it
was held by the House of Lords that there could be liability in negligence
to an employee for an inaccurate reference under the Hedley Byrne
principle.

23

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

This overturned the decision of the Court of Appeal in the same case
which held that any right of action would be in defamation where there
would be the defence of qualified privilege. This defence would only
be defeated by the plaintiff if malice could be proved, which is extremely
difficult.
Similar situations have arisen where a doctor has examined a plaintiff
on behalf of someone else such as a company. In Baker v Kaye (1997), a
doctor carried out a pre-employment medical assessment on behalf of
a company. It was held that, in such circumstances, a doctor could owe
a duty of care to the prospective employee. Although, on the facts of the
case, there had been no breach of duty. The case was distinguished from
Spring as there had never been a contractual relationship between the
prospective employer and prospective employee, but it was regarded
as just and reasonable to impose a duty.
In Kapfunde v Abbey National plc (1998), the plaintiff applied for a job
and filled in a medical questionnaire. A doctor who considered the
questionnaire felt that the plaintiff might be frequently absent from work.
The Court of Appeal held that there was no duty of care owed by the
doctor to the plaintiff as there was insufficient proximity. The Court of
Appeal disapproved of the decision in Baker v Kaye.
Voluntary assumption of responsibility other than for negligent
mis-statements
There is also a line of cases that allows recovery for pure economic loss
in negligence when the special skills and expertise of a provider of
professional services has been relied on by someone other than his client.
In Ross v Caunters (1979), a solicitor allowed the spouse of a beneficiary
to witness a will. As a result, the gift to the beneficiary lapsed. It was
held that the solicitor was liable to the beneficiary, as damage to her
could have been foreseen and she belonged to a closed category of
persons.
Ross v Caunters was decided during the period of the Anns test. It was
uncertain after the demise of that test whether this type of economic loss
would remain recoverable. It was found to have survived in the House
of Lords’ decision of White v Jones (1995). The facts were that the testator
of a will cut his two daughters out of his estate following a quarrel. After
a reconciliation with his daughters, he sent a letter instructing a firm of
solicitors that legacies of £9,000 should be given to each of his two
daughters, the plaintiffs. The letter was received on 17 July and nothing
was done by the solicitors for a month. On 16 August, the firm’s managing

24

NEGLIGENCE

clerk asked the firm’s probate department to draw up a will or codicil
incorporating the new legacies. The following day the managing clerk
went on holiday and on his return a fortnight later he arranged to see
the testator on 17 September. The testator died on 14 September before
the new will had been executed.
Lord Goff held that the plaintiffs were owed a duty of care as otherwise
there would be a lacuna in the law. The solicitor owes a duty of care to
his client and generally owes no duty to a third party. If an extension to
the Hedley Byrne principle were not allowed, there would be no method
of enforcing the contractual right. Those who had a valid claim (the
testator and his estate) had suffered no loss. Those who had suffered a
loss (the disappointed beneficiaries) would not have a valid claim. Lord
Browne Wilkinson found that the situation was analogous to Hedley
Byrne.
It was held in Hemmens v Wilson Browne (1993) that the principle would
not extend to an inter vivos transaction, as it would always be possible
to rectify a mistake.
White v Jones could not be relied on in Goodwill v British Pregnancy
Advisory Service (1996). A woman who knew that her partner had undergone
a vasectomy did not use any form of contraception and subsequently
became pregnant. Her partner had been assured by the defendants that
the operation had been successful and that future contraception was
unnecessary. It was argued that the situation was analogous to White v
Jones. The plaintiff was not owed a duty as it was not known that the
advice would be communicated to the advisee and would be acted upon
by her. She belonged to an indeterminate class of women with whom
the man could have formed a relationship after the operation.
Some indication of the scope of the duty is provided by Woodward v
Wolferstans (1997). The plaintiff had purchased a property raising 95%
of the purchase price by way of mortgage. The defendants were a firm
of solicitors who acted for her father who guaranteed the mortgage.
There was no contact between the firm and the plaintiff. After the mortgage
fell into arrears, the lender commenced possession proceedings. It was
held that the defendants had assumed responsibility for tasks which
were known or ought to be known to closely affect the plaintiff’s economic
well being. This did not extend to explaining the details of the transaction
and the implications of the mortgage.

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Liability for defective products
Donoghue v Stevenson is the basis at common law for stating that a
manufacturer can be liable to the ultimate consumer of a product for
defects in its manufacture. This area has been greatly affected by the
Consumer Protection Act 1987, which makes manufacturers strictly liable
for defects in their products. The common law rules still retain a residuary
significance where property is not in private use, the limitation period
under the Act has expired, or for claims under £275.
Nature of the loss

Lord Atkin said that damages were recoverable for defective products
in respect of injury to the ‘consumer ’s life or property’. This phrase
‘property’ has come to mean ‘other property’. The plaintiff cannot claim
in tort for the product being defective in itself. Any claim for the product
being worth less than the plaintiff thought it was worth lies in contract.
In D and F Estates v Church Commissioners (1988), it was held that a
defective product would have to have caused damage to other property
or personal injury for the claim to be recoverable in negligence. If a
dangerous defect is discovered prior to it causing personal injury or
damage to other property, then this will not be recoverable.
Liability for defective buildings
Liability of local authority

This area clearly illustrates the swing that has taken place in the courts’
attitude. There is a long line of decisions beginning with Dutton v Bognor
Regis UDC (1972) and, most famously, Anns v Merton LBC where local
authorities were held liable to building owners in respect of negligent
inspections of foundations leading to damage to the building itself.
The flow of cases in favour of the building owner and against local
authorities was reversed by the case of Peabody Donation Fund v Sir
Lindsay Parkinson and Co Ltd (1984), where it was held that local authorities
are not liable to the original building owner since he is the author of his
own misfortunes and since he is under an obligation to ensure that his
work is carried out properly. This was applied in Investors in Industry
Ltd v South Bedfordshire DC (1986).
Eventually, of course, Anns was overruled by the case of Murphy v
Brentwood DC when it was held that a local authority’s only duty was
to take ‘reasonable care to prevent injury to safety or health’ so economic
loss in the form of discovering a latent defect before it causes physical
injury is not recoverable by anyone whether a building owner or subsequent

26

NEGLIGENCE

owner occupier. Physical injury would still be recoverable in the case of
an owner occupier and possibly still a building owner if there are
‘exceptional circumstances’. These ‘exceptional circumstances’ existed
in the case of Richardson v West Lindsay DC (1990) as the builder had no
specialised knowledge and there has been reliance on the local authority’s
opinion, which was known or ought to have been known to the local
authority.
Liability of builder

Although it is now virtually impossible to sue a local authority in respect
of failure to discover a defect in plans, it may be possible to sue the
builder in negligence. A builder will usually only be liable for latent
defects which cause personal injury or damage to other property. In
exceptional cases, a builder will also be liable for defects which are
known to the occupier but where it is unreasonable to expect the occupier
to remove the defect and it is reasonable to expect the occupier to run
the risk of injury which the defect creates. In Targett v Torfaen BC (1992),
the plaintiff was the tenant of a council house built by the defendants.
He fell down a flight of stairs which had no handrail and was unlit. After
a 25% deduction for contributory negligence, the defendants were held
liable. Even though the plaintiff was aware of the danger, it was not
reasonable to expect him to provide a handrail nor was it unreasonable
for him to use the stairway without a handrail.
Lord Goff in Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd (1994) said that a
building owner would not normally be able to sue a sub-contractor or
supplier if sub-contracted work or materials do not conform to the
required standard. There would have to be an assumption of responsibility
by the sub-contractor or supplier direct to the building owner under
Headley Byrne principles.
As far as the building itself is concerned, it may be possible to sue
the builder for breach of statutory duty for breach of building regulations
or to bring an action under s 1 of the Defective Premises Act 1972. The
Defective Premises Act 1972 only applies to dwellings which are not
part of the NHBC scheme.
Exercise of statutory powers
This area deals with the question whether public authorities exercising
statutory powers owe any duty to a private individual suffering loss or
injury resulting from an authority’s negligence.
There are four main problems in this area:

27

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

• many statutory powers confer a discretion as to how and whether
the relevant power should be exercised;
• where the alleged negligence is a failure to exercise statutory power
the question of liability for omissions is raised in its most obvious
form;
• recent case law may require the injured individual to pursue a different
and more restrictive procedural remedy from the ordinary action
instituted by writ;
• finally, the Court of Appeal held that the statutory framework and
remedies for adjudication in claims for social security benefits excluded
altogether any common law remedy for negligence.
Now, the problem of whether a duty of care will ever be imposed in
respect of the negligent exercise of statutory powers and the problem
of liability for failure to exercise a power can be considered together.
In Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd, the damage arose in circumstances
that were foreseeable. The Home Office had a wide discretion as to how
to run Borstals. If the Home Office was held to owe a duty to private
individuals for escaping trainees then the exercise of their discretion
might be inhibited. So, Lord Diplock stipulated that the Home Office
could not be held liable unless the act resulted in an ultra vires act of the
Home Office or its servants. Borstal officers had disregarded instructions
and so their conduct was ultra vires. The duty was only owed to those
in the immediate vicinity whose property was reasonably foreseeably
likely to be damaged or stolen in the immediate escape.
His reasoning was further developed in Anns v Merton LBC where
the local authority argued that it had merely exercised a power and had
not been under a mandatory duty to inspect all foundations. The authority
argued that:
• it would not be liable for omitting to inspect; and
• if it was not liable for inspecting it could not be liable for negligent
inspection.
Again, it was stated that ultra vires conduct could create a duty of care,
and that ultra vires conduct could be a failure to exercise a power at all,
or an improper exercise of that power.
The House of Lords made a distinction between:
• planning/policy decisions; and
• operational decisions,

28

NEGLIGENCE

and stated that they would be far more likely to find a duty of care where
there had been an operational error and would be less likely to interfere
with policy matters.
Although Anns was overruled by Murphy v Brentwood DC, it is thought
that this policy/operational dichotomy is still valid. It was said in Rowling
v Takaro (1988) that there was no automatic liability for operational decisions
but the distinction could be seen as a preliminary filter. Policy decisions
would be automatically filtered out but once this step has been overcome
then there is a need to decide whether a duty should be imposed on the
basis of foreseeability, proximity and if it was fair, just and reasonable
to do so.
As we have already seen, there has been a trend of restricting the tort
of negligence in this area. In Yeun Kun-Yeu v AG of Hong Kong (1987),
Rowling v Takaro Properties (1988) and Davis v Radcliffe (1990), the factors
that were cited as militating against a duty of care were similar, for
example, the distorting effect of potential liability on the decision making
process, and the waste of public money involved in civil servants
cautiously investigating the case to the detriment of other members of
the public, the difficulty of ever proving negligence in the making of
such a decision and the difficulty of distinguishing the cases in which
legal advice should have been sought.
This generally restrictive approach to negligence claims in this area
appears to be a reluctance to introduce the tortious duty of care where
there is an existing system of redress or the statutory regulatory system
has made no provision for individual claims.
This trend towards the containment of negligence actions can be seen
in Jones v Department of Employment (1988), where one of the grounds for
the Court of Appeal’s decision that a social security adjudication officer
owed no duty of care to a claimant was that the duty of the adjudication
officer lay in the sphere of public law and was only enforceable by way
of statutory appeals procedure or by judicial review.
The House of Lords again held that policy decisions were outside the
scope of negligence in X v Bedfordshire CC (1995). It was held that, where
a statutory discretion was imposed on a local authority, it was for the
authority to exercise the discretion and nothing which the authority
would do within the ambit of the discretion could be actionable at
common law.
Where the decision complained of fell outside the statutory discretion,
it could give rise to common law liability but where the factors relevant
to the exercise of the discretion included matters of policy, the court

29

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

could not adjudicate on such policy matters and therefore could not
reach the decision that it was outside the statutory ambit.
In W v Essex CC (1998), it was found to be arguable that the considerations
which led to a duty not being imposed in X v Bedfordshire CC did not
apply where a local authority were not performing any statutory duty.
The plaintiffs became foster parents on the defendant’s assurance that
no child known or suspected of child abuse would be placed with them.
A child who was known to have been cautioned for sexually abusing
his sister was placed with the plaintiffs and sexually abused their four
children. The children had an arguable case in negligence.
An appeal by the parents went to the House of Lords in 2000. It was
held that their claim for damages in negligence was not so bad that it
ought to be struck out.
X v Bedfordshire CC was followed by the Court of Appeal in Phelps v
Hillingdon LBC (1999) when the defendant’s adviser failed to spot the
plaintiff’s dyslexia. It was held that dyslexia was not an injury and in
the absence of an assumption of responsibility the defendants were not
liable for the same reasons as were set out in X v Bedfordshire CC.
However, the Court of Appeal’s ruling was overturned when it went
to the House of Lords in 2000. The House of Lords held that any person
exercising a skill or profession owes a duty of care to people who it can
be forseen will be injured if due skill or care is not exercised. Such a duty
does not depend on a contractual relationship and includes a teacher
concerned with children having special educational needs or an educational
psychologist. A local education authority may be liable for such breaches
vicariously. Breaches of duties of care may include a failure to diagnose
dyslexic pupils and to provide appropriate education for them.
However, X v Bedfordshire CC was distinguished in Barrett v Enfield
LBC (1999). A local authority that places a child in care is under a duty
of care to make arrangements for the child’s future and can be sued for
negligence if that duty is broken. The difference between the cases was
that, in Barrett, the plaintiff had already been in care and the defendant
was liable for subsequent actions that affected him. In X v Bedfordshire
CC, the local authority had failed to take the children into care after it
received reports of parental abuse and gross neglect. A distinction was
made again between policy and operational decisions.
The same conclusion was reached in Stovin v Wise (1996) when Lord
Hoffman said that the minimum pre-conditions for basing a duty of care
on the existence of a statutory power were first, it would have to have
been irrational not to have exercised the power, so that there was a public
duty to act and secondly, there were exceptional grounds for holding
that the policy of the statute required compensation to be paid to persons
who suffered loss because the power was not exercised.
30

NEGLIGENCE

Another reason advanced for not imposing a duty on public authorities
is that it would lead to defensiveness in their decision making. In Harris
v Evans (1998), a Health and Safety inspector making negligently excessive
requirements of bungee operators when making recommendations as
to whether activities should be authorised under the Health and Safety
at Work Act 1974 was not liable. It was part of the system of regulation
that it would have adverse impacts for certain sections of society. There
was an appeals mechanism built into the legislation and a common law
duty of care would lead to inspectors being defensive in the exercise of
their enforcement powers under the Act.
A duty will also not be imposed on a public authority if it would not
be fair, just and reasonable or a common law duty would be inconsistent
with, or discourage, the due performance by the public authority of its
statutory duties. In Clunis v Camden and Islington HA (1998), the plaintiff
had been detained under the Mental Health Act 1983. Following the
discharge, the defendants under s 117 of the same Act were under a duty
to provide after care services but failed to do so. Three months after
discharge, he killed a stranger and was convicted of manslaughter. He
was ordered to be detained in a special hospital. It was held not to be
fair and reasonable to hold the defendant liable for the plaintiff’s criminal
act.

Breach of duty: standard of care
Having established that the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care,
it will next be necessary to determine whether the defendant has in fact
breached that duty. The defendant will have fulfilled his duty if he has
behaved in accordance with the standard of the reasonable man. This
is an objective standard and disregards the personal idiosyncrasies of
the defendant. Everyone is judged by the same standard, the only
exceptions being skilled defendants, children, the insane and physically
ill.
The question whether a person has fulfilled a particular duty is a
question of fact. It was held by the House of Lords in Qualcast
(Wolverhampton) Ltd v Haynes (1959) that reasonableness will depend on
the circumstances of the case and it is a mistake to rely on previous cases
as precedents for what constitutes negligence. So, in Worsfold v Howe
(1980), the trial judge held that a driver who had edged out from a side
road and across stationary tankers before colliding with a motorcyclist
was negligent as the Court of Appeal had ruled that similar actions were

31

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

negligent in a previous case. The Court of Appeal held that the previous
case laid down no legal principle, that such decisions were to be treated
as questions of fact.
Factors of the objective standard
The law provides various guiding principles as to the objective standard.
Reasonable assessment of the risk

This can be further subdivided into two factors.
Degree of likelihood of harm occurring

A reasonable man is not usually expected to take precautions against
something where there is only a small risk of it occurring. Two cricketing
cases provide a simple illustration. First, in Bolton v Stone (1951), a cricket
ball had been hit out of a cricket ground six times in 28 years into a
nearby, rarely used lane. On the seventh occasion, it hit a passer-by. It
was held that the chances of such an accident occurring were so small
that it was not reasonable to expect the defendant to take precautions
against it happening.
However, in Miller v Jackson (1977), a cricket ball was hit out of a
ground eight to nine times a season. In this case, it was held that the
defendant had been negligent as it was reasonable to expect the defendant
to take precautions. The crucial difference between the two cases is that
the risk of harm was much greater in this case than in Bolton v Stone.
There can be liability when the risk is not serious but there is a
recognised risk and there is a rule to provide protection. In Hartshorn v
Secretary of State for the Home Department (1999), a prisoner was attacked
by two other prisoners and slashed across the face. The attack occurred
whilst tea was being served and prisoners were entitled to associate
with prisoners from different wings. Prisoners were prohibited from
leaving the ground floor, at such times. There were no officers either on
the upper floors or guarding the stairs. Although an officer was supervising
generally, he was not present at the time of the attack, as he was absent
on an errand. The prisoners attacked the plaintiff on an upper floor.
Although there was no reason to suspect an attack, the defendant should
have taken reasonable care should have taken reasonable care to ensure
the rule was obeyed.

32

NEGLIGENCE

Seriousness of the harm that may occur

This is an exception to the above, as where there is a small risk but the
potential harm that may occur is great then a reasonable man would be
expected to take precautions.
In Paris v Stepney BC (1951), the plaintiff was blind in one eye. While
he was working for the defendants, a metal chip entered his good eye
and rendered him totally blind. The defendants were found to be negligent
in failing to supply him with goggles since, even though there had only
been a small risk, the consequences were serious.
The object to be achieved

The importance of the object to be attained is also a factor which is taken
into account when deciding the standard of care. It is necessary to assess
the utility of the defendant’s act. The greater its social utility, the greater
the likelihood of the defendant’s behaviour being assessed as reasonable.
In Watt v Hertfordshire CC (1954), the plaintiff was a fireman and part
of a rescue team that was rushing to the scene of an accident to rescue
a woman trapped under a car. The plaintiff was injured as a heavy piece
of equipment, due to the emergency circumstances had not been properly
secured on the lorry on which it was travelling. It was held that it was
necessary to ‘balance the risk against the object to be achieved’. The
action for negligence failed as the risk of the equipment causing injury
in transit was not so great as to prevent the efforts to save the woman’s
life.
Practicability of precautions

The cost of avoiding a risk is also a material factor in the standard of
care. The defendant will not be expected to spend vast sums of money
on avoiding a risk which is very small.
In Latimer v AEC Ltd (1953), the defendant’s factory was flooded, the
water mixed with factory oil and made the floor slippery. Sawdust was
spread on the surface but not enough to cover the whole affected area.
It was held that the employers were not negligent. It was necessary
to balance the risk against the measures necessary to eliminate it. In this
case, the risk was not so great as to justify the expense of closing the
factory down.
General and approved practice

If it is shown that the defendant acted in accordance with general and
approved practice, then this may be strong evidence that he has not been

33

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

negligent. However, this is not conclusive and a defendant may still be
negligent even though he acted in accordance with a common practice.
There is a obligation on the defendant to keep up to date with
developments and to change practices in the light of new knowledge
(Stokes v Guest, Keen and Nettleford (Bolts and Nuts) Ltd (1968)).
It will not be a defence to say that general and approved practice has
been followed, if it is an obvious folly to do so. ‘Neglect of duty does
not by repetition cease to be neglect of duty’, per Slesser LJ in CarpentersÕ
Co v British Mutual Banking Co Ltd (1937).
The doctrine of ‘obvious folly’ was first expounded by Lord Dunedin
in Morton v William Dixon Ltd (1907) and a recent illustration can be
found in Re Herald of Free Enterprise (1987). Following the Zeebrugge ferry
disaster, the master of the ship claimed that it was general and approved
practice for him not to check that the bow doors were closed prior to
setting out to sea. It was held that the general and approved practice
constituted an ‘obvious folly’ and should not have been followed.
Failure to comply with a guide to professional conduct is not conclusive
proof of negligence (Johnson v Bingley (1995)).
The general standard and skilled defendants
Skilled defendants are judged by higher standards than the ordinary
defendant. The test for skilled defendants was encapsulated by McNair
J in Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee (1957):
The test is the standard of the ordinary skilled man exercising and
professing to have that particular skill. A man need not possess the
highest expert skill at the risk of being found negligent. It is well
established law that it is sufficient if he exercises the ordinary skill
of an ordinary competent man exercising that particular art.

It can be seen that skilled defendants must meet a higher standard than
the ordinary person and this is an exception to the rule that everyone is
judged by the same standard.
Skilled defendants face a particular problem when trying to invoke
the defence of general and approved practice, as often there are conflicting
views within a profession as to which course of action is the appropriate
course to take. Bolam gave an answer to this problem when it stated that
a doctor was not negligent if he acted in accordance with a respectable
body of opinion merely because another body of opinion took a contrary
view. It was also held that a doctor could not be criticised if he believed
damages of treatment were minimal and did not stress them to the
patient.

34

NEGLIGENCE

Bolam was applied in the case of Sidaway v Bethlem Royal Hospital Govrs
(1985), where it was held that a doctor was under a duty to inform a
patient of special/real risks but this is subject to an overriding duty to
act in the patient’s best interest.
However, conditions were attached to the Bolam test in Bolitho v City
and Hackney HA (1997). A two year old boy suffered brain damage as a
result of the bronchial air passages becoming blocked leading to cardiac
arrest. It was agreed that the only course of action to prevent the damage
was to have the boy intubated. The doctor who negligently failed to
attend the boy said that she would not have intubated had she attended.
There was evidence from one expert witness that he would not have
intubated, whereas five other experts said that they would have done
so.
The House of Lords held that there would have to be a logical basis
for the opinion not to intubate. This would involve a weighing of risks
against benefit in order to achieve a desirable conclusion. In effect, this
means that a judge will be entitled to choose between two bodies of
expert opinion and to reject an opinion which is ‘legally indefensible’.
Bolitho was applied in Marriott v West Midlands RHA (1998) when it
was held by the Court of Appeal that a trial judge was not bound to
follow the opinion of a body of experts. The opinion could be subject to
scrutiny to see if it was based on logic.
The Court of Appeal held that the Bolam test had no application in
Penney v East Kent HA (1999). The plaintiffs failed to have abnormalities
in their cervical smears identified. The trial judge had been entitled to
conclude that a test contained abnormalities even though there was
conflicting medical evidence on the issue. The Bolam test was appropriate
where the exercise of skill and care by the screener was being questioned
but it had no application where a judge had to determine what the slides
actually showed, even where that was the subject of conflicting medical
opinion.
Trainee experts

The potential harshness of the objective standard for skilled defendants
is illustrated by the case of Wilsher v Essex AHA (1988), when it was
stated that a young, inexperienced doctor is judged by the standards of
a competent experienced doctor even though, by definition, he is unable
to attain that standard.

35

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Experts outside the medical field

The same principles extend outside the medical sphere in Wells v Cooper
(1958), where the Court of Appeal held that a householder performing
a DIY task was judged by the standard of a reasonably competent carpenter.
In Philips v William Whiteley (1938), the court rejected the idea that a
jeweller who carried out an ear piercing operation should be judged by
the standard of a surgeon but instead the court said that she should be
judged by the standard of a reasonably competent jeweller carrying out
that particular task.
In Nettleship v Weston (1971), a learner driver was judged by the
standard of a ‘competent and experienced driver’ since she held herself
out as possessing a certain standard of skill and experience. The court
felt that a uniform standard of skill was preferable because of the practical
difficulty of assessing a particular person’s actual skill or experience.
Expert standard depends on the surrounding circumstances

In the same way as the ordinary standard, the expert standard depends
on the circumstances of the particular case.
In Wooldridge v Sumner (1963), a momentary lapse on the part of a
showjumper did not make him negligent. Wooldridge v Sumner involved
a participant in a sporting event injuring a spectator. In Smolden v Whitworth
(1996), it was held that a rugby referee’s level of care to a participant in
a sporting event was that appropriate in all the circumstances. The
threshold of liability was a high one and would not be easily crossed.
On the facts of the case, the referee was liable for spinal injuries caused
by a collapsed scrum.
Abnormal defendants
Further exceptions to the rule that everyone is judged by the same
standard in assessing whether they are negligent are children, the insane
and physically ill. Both categories are treated separately and different
principles apply.
Children

In Gough v Thorne (1966), Lord Denning said that a 12 year old child
could not be contributorily negligent. In Walmsley v Humenick (1954), it
was held that very young children were incapable of negligence as they
were incapable of foreseeing harm. It should be noted that in tort there
is no fixed age for liability unlike in criminal law.

36

NEGLIGENCE

A problem with children has been in deciding whether subjective
circumstances such as the child’s mental ability and maturity be taken
into account or should an objective standard be applied in the same way
as for adults?
The High Court of Australia in McHale v Watson (1966) held that a 12
year old boy should be judged by ‘the foresight and prudence of an
ordinary boy of 12’.
McHale v Watson was followed by the Court of Appeal in Mullin v
Richards (1998). Two 15 year old boys were playing with plastic rulers
when one broke and a piece of plastic entered the plaintiff’s eye. The
test was whether the risk of injury would have been foreseeable to an
ordinarily prudent and reasonable 15 year old girl.
The insane and the physically ill

The principles which apply here seem to revolve around whether the
defendant was aware of his condition and also whether the defendant
had control over his own actions.
Defendant is unaware of the condition

In Waugh v Allan (1964), the defendant, a lorry driver, was in the habit
of suffering gastric attacks which normally quickly passed. After one
such attack, the defendant pulled off the road and when he felt better
continued on his journey only to suffer a fatal coronary thrombosis and
injured the plaintiff. The defendant was held not to be negligent as he
had recovered sufficient skill and judgment to continue his journey.
In Jones v Dennison (1971), the defendant was unaware that he suffered
from blackout attacks as a result of epilepsy. He suffered a blackout
while driving, injuring the plaintiff. It was held that he could not be
considered negligent, as he was unaware of his tendency to blackout.
Defendant retains control over his actions

In situations where the defendant retains some control over his actions,
he will be held liable.
In Roberts v Ramsbottom (1980), the defendant suffered a stroke shortly
after starting a two and a half mile journey. He had two collisions before
colliding with the plaintiff’s parked vehicle. It was found that he was
aware of the collisions and had retained some impaired control over his
actions and consequently was liable.
In Moriss v Marsden (1952), the defendant suffered from a mental
disease which robbed him of his moral judgment. While suffering from
this disease he attacked and injured the plaintiff, while he knew the

37

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

nature and quality of his act, he did not know that what he was doing
was wrong. The defendant was held to be liable.
Proof of breach
The burden of proof rests with the plaintiff on the balance of probabilities.
However, there may be ways in which the plaintiff can receive assistance
in discharging that burden of proof.
Assistance by statute
Section 11 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968

Where the defendant has been convicted of criminal proceedings, that
conviction will be admissible in civil proceedings and the defendant
will be taken to have committed the acts until the contrary is proved.
For example, proof of the defendant’s conviction for careless driving
places the burden of disproving the occurrence of negligent driving on
the defendant.
Assistance at common law
Res ipsa loquitur

‘The thing speaks for itself’. This doctrine originally began with the case
of Scott v London and St KatherineÕ s Dock (1865). First, it should be noted
that it is an evidential burden and, secondly, three conditions must apply
before it can be invoked:
• Accident could not have occurred without negligence
For example, stones are not found in buns unless someone has been
negligent (Chaproni•r e v Mason (1905)); barrels of flour do not fall
from warehouse windows onto the street in the absence of negligence
(Byrne v Boadle (1863)). On the other hand, losses on the commodity
market are not prima facie evidence of negligence on the part of brokers
(Stafford v Conti Commodity Services Ltd (1981)); nor is a spark from a
domestic fire (Sochacki v Sas (1947)).
In Scott v London and St KatherineÕ s Docks Co, it was said that the accident
must have happened in ‘the ordinary course of things’. As a result,
the issue has arisen whether the doctrine can apply to matters which
are outside the common experience. In Mahon v Osborne (1939), a swab
had been left inside a patient after an abdominal operation. Scott LJ
thought that the doctrine could not apply to surgical operations as
they are outside a judge’s common experience. Since then, the Court

38

NEGLIGENCE

of Appeal has allowed the doctrine to be invoked in cases of medical
negligence in Cassidy v Ministry of Health (1951). Although it was said
by Lord Denning in Hucks v Cole (1968) that res ipsa loquitur could
only be invoked against a doctor in ‘extreme’ cases. This adds to the
plaintiff’s difficulties in cases of medical negligence which statistically
are harder to prove than other types of negligence.
• Control by the defendant
If the defendant is not in control of the situation which could not have
occurred without negligence, then the doctrine cannot be invoked.
In Easson v London and North Eastern Railway Co (1944), the railway
company could not be said to be in control of railway doors on a
journey from Edinburgh to London, because of the possibility of
interference by a third party.
This can be contrasted with Gee v Metropolitan Railway Co (1873) where
someone fell trough a train door shortly after it left the station. Here,
it could be said to be under the control of the railway company, since
there was no opportunity for third party interference.
• Absence of alternative explanation by the defendant
The cause of the accident must be unknown (Barkway v South Western
Transport (1950)).
The effect of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur

The effect of res ipsa loquitur depends principally on the cogency of the
inference. The more cogent the inference the greater the defendant’s task
in overcoming assumptions of negligence. The effect, therefore, is
subjective and depends on the case but two views have been formed as
to the effect:
• An evidential burden of proof is cast on the defendant
In other words, the defendant is required to provide a reasonable
explanation of how the accident could have occurred without negligence
on his part. If he does so, then the plaintiff goes back to square one
and must prove on the balance of probabilities that the defendant has
been negligent. Support for this view can be found in Colvilles Ltd v
Devine (1969).
• The other view is that it reverses the burden of proof
The defendant must prove on the balance of probabilities, that he has
not been negligent. Support for this view can be found in Henderson

39

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

v Jenkins (1970) and Ward v Tesco Stores (1976). The Privy Council in
Ng Chun Pui v Lee Chuen Tat (1988) stated that the burden of proof
does not shift to the defendant but remains with the plaintiff throughout
the case. It has also been argued that if res ipsa loquitur reverses the
burden of proof then paradoxically a plaintiff who relies on the maxim
will be in a better position than a plaintiff who establishes a prima
facie case in some other way.

Causation
The plaintiff not only has to prove that the defendant owes him a duty
of care and has breached his duty but also that the defendant caused
the plaintiff’s loss. This is not always as obvious as it sounds.
‘But for’ test
The defendant’s breach of duty must as a matter of fact be a cause of
the damage. As a preliminary test in deciding whether the defendant’s
breach has caused the plaintiff’s damage, the courts have developed the
‘but for’ test. In other words, would the plaintiff not have suffered the
damage ‘but for’ the event brought about by the defendant?
An example of the working of the test is contained in Barnett v Chelsea
and Kensington Hospital Management Committee (1969). Three nightwatchmen
called into a hospital at the end of a shift, complaining that they had been
vomiting after drinking tea. The nurse on duty consulted a doctor by
telephone and he said that the men should go home and consult their
doctor in the morning. Later the same day the plaintiff’s husband died
of arsenical poisoning.
The doctor owed the plaintiff’s husband a duty of care. In failing to
examine the plaintiff’s husband, the doctor had breached his duty of
care, but the hospital was held not to be liable as the breach had not
caused the death. The plaintiff’s husband would have died even if the
doctor had examined him. Applying the ‘but for’ test, would the plaintiff
not have suffered the damage ‘but for’ the event brought about by the
defendant? The answer has to be no.
Further examples of the ‘but for’ test can be found in Robinson v Post
Office (1974), where a doctor was held not to be liable for failing to
administer a test dose of a drug where it would have failed to have
revealed the allergy and in McWilliams v Sir William Arrol and Co Ltd
(1962), where employers were found not to be liable for failing to provide

40

NEGLIGENCE

a safety belt where it was proved that the employee would not have
worn it even if it had been provided and The Empire Jamaica (1957), where
liability was limited to ‘actual fault’ and the only fault that could be
attributed to the owners was a failure to apply for a mate’s certificate
which would have been granted as a formality.
Nature of the ‘but for’ test

Students often fail to understand the true nature of the ‘but for’ test. It
is vital to keep the following points in mind:
• it acts as a preliminary filter, that is, it sifts irrelevant causes from
relevant causes;
• it has no application where there are several successive causes of an
accident.
Several successive causes
The ‘but for’ test will not be of much assistance where the plaintiff has
been affected by two successive acts or events. In this type of situation,
there has been a sequence of events and every act in the sequence is a
relevant cause as far as the plaintiff’s damage is concerned so the courts
have to decide the operative cause.
The courts have not always been consistent in their approach. One
method is to establish whether the later event has added to the plaintiff’s
damage, if not then the person who caused the original injury will be
liable.
In Performance Cars Ltd v Abraham (1962), the plaintiff’s Rolls Royce
had been involved in an accident and the damage involved the cost of
respraying the car. Two weeks later, the defendant was involved in an
accident with the plaintiff for which the defendant accepted responsibility.
This time, there was damage to the wing and bumper which necessitated
a respray of the lower part of the car. The defendant was not liable as
he had not contributed any more damage than had occurred after the
first accident.
A similar sequence took place in Baker v Willoughby (1970). As a result
of the defendant’s negligence, the plaintiff suffered an injury to his left
leg. Before the trial and while working at a new job, the plaintiff was
the victim of an armed robbery and suffered gunshot wounds to the
same left leg which then had to be amputated. The defendants argued
that their liability was extinguished by the second incident. In other
words, they were only liable from the date of the accident to the date of

41

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

the bank robbery. The House of Lords rejected this. They held that the
plaintiff was being compensated for his loss of amenity, that is, the loss
of a good left leg, the difference between a damaged leg and a sound
leg. The fact that the leg was further damaged at some later date did not
alter the fact that he had already been deprived of the facility of a properly
functioning left leg.
In both these cases, there have been two successive incidents and the
second incident has not added to the plaintiff’s loss so the perpetrator
of the first incident has remained liable. This can be contrasted with
Jobling v Associated Dairies Ltd (1982). The facts were that the defendants
negligently caused an injury to the plaintiff’s back. Three years later and
before trial, the plaintiff was diagnosed as suffering from a condition
called myelopathy, which was unrelated to the accident. This time it was
accepted, in contrast to the other cases, the second incident extinguished
liability. The main differences between these cases have been identified
as follows:
• in Jobling, the second incident occurred as a result of a natural condition,
whereas in Baker v Willoughby there was an intervention by a third
party;
• policy decisions on the part of the court (if the court had accepted
that the second incident extinguished liability in Baker, this would
have left the defendant without compensation after the second incident).
Simultaneous events
The pragmatic approach of the courts was again evident in the case of
Fitzgerald v Lane (1987). The facts were that the plaintiff crossed a pelican
crossing when the red pedestrian light was showing, he was hit by the
first defendant’s car and thrown onto the car’s windscreen, then onto
the ground and while lying on the ground the second defendant ran over
him. It was impossible to determine each defendant’s contribution towards
the injury. He could have suffered slight injuries from the first defendant
and been badly injured by the second or vice versa. The court held that
after taking into account the plaintiff’s contributory negligence, both
defendants were equally liable.
Multiple causes
So far, we have looked at situations where there have been a sequence
of events. Slightly different issues arise when there are several possible
causes of an injury. Again, the courts approach has not always been
consistent.
42

NEGLIGENCE

Where breach of duty materially increases the risk of injury, the
defendant will be held liable

In McGhee v National Coal Board (1972), the defendants failed to supply
adequate washing facilities. Although this could not be proved to have
caused the defendant’s dermatitis, there was evidence to suggest that
it had increased the risk of contracting the disease. This was sufficient
to make the defendant liable.
The more recent trend is to state that for the defendant to be liable the
defendant’s cause must be the probable cause

In Wilsher v Essex AHA (1986), the plaintiff’s injury could have been
caused by one of six possible causes. One of these causes was the
administration of an excess of oxygen in the first 30 hours of the baby’s
birth, which had been carried out by the doctor. It was held that the
plaintiff had to prove that the excess of oxygen was the probable cause
of the injury, not that it had increased the baby’s risk of being born blind.
This approach was followed in Hotson v East Berkshire AHA (1987).
The facts were that a boy fell out of a tree injuring his hip. He was rushed
to hospital, but the injury was not diagnosed for five days. The boy
developed a hip condition. There was a 75% chance that the condition
would have developed anyway and a 25% chance that the delay in
diagnosis had caused the condition. The trial judge reduced damages
by 75%. On appeal, it was held that this approach was incorrect. The
defendants would not be liable unless their cause was the probable cause.
As it was more likely that the condition would have developed anyway,
then the most probable cause was that it had developed as a result of
the fall. The defendants were not liable.
The approach in Wilshier and Hotson to decide causation questions
has not been followed in other areas of negligence not involving personal
injury. In a case the negligent mis-statement case of First Interstate Bank
of California v Cohen Arnold & Co (1995), damages were awarded on a
basis that was proportionate to the likelihood of the event occurring.
The defendants were a firm of accountants and, in a letter, grossly
overestimated the worth of their client to the plaintiffs, a bank. As a
result of the letter, the plaintiffs delayed enforcing their security. The
property was sold for £1.4 million. If it had been sold when the bank
first made inquiries as to the client’s worth it would have been worth
£3 million. There was a two in three chance that they would have sold
when they first made inquiries, so damages were reduced to £2 million.

43

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Omissions

If the negligent conduct takes the form of an omission, special difficulties
apply. The court must consider what would have happened if the
defendant had acted instead of omitting to do so. The issue will then be
whether the omission to act made any difference to the outcome. In cases
involving special skills, the Bolam test, as modified by Bolitho, will then
apply (Bolitho v City and Hackney HA (1997)).
Intervening acts that break the chain of causation (novus
actus interveniens)
Sometimes, something can occur between the defendant’s act and the
plaintiff’s injury, which breaks the chain of causation so the defendant
can no longer be said to be liable to the plaintiff. This is a novus actus
interveniens.
It was described by Lord Wright in The Oropesa (1943) as:
... a new cause which disturbs the sequence of events, something
which can be described as either unreasonable or extraneous or
extrinsic.

The facts of The Oropesa (1943) were that two ships collided. The captain
of one ship put out to sea in heavy weather in a lifeboat to discuss the
situation with the captain of the other ship and was drowned. It was
argued that this constituted a novus actus but this was rejected as it was
held that the decision to put out to sea was reasonable in the circumstances.
A rescuer’s intervention will not be considered a novus actus, as long
as the peril is active (Haynes v Harwood (1935)).
The courts have been quite lenient in what they consider to be a
reasonable act. In Philco Radio and Television Corporation of Great Britain
Ltd v J Spurling and Others (1949), it was held that the act of a typist in
touching film scrap with a lighted cigarette with the intention of causing
a ‘small innocuous fire’, but with the result that she caused a serious fire
and explosion when the scrap had been wrongly delivered to the plaintiff’s
premises was not a novus actus as it was not an unreasonable act in the
circumstances, even though it was unforeseeable.
For an intervening act to constitute a novus actus, it must be something
in the order of an illegal act such as in Knightley v Johns (1982) where a
police officer, contrary to police standing orders sent a police motorcyclist
the wrong way through a tunnel without first sealing the tunnel off.
This constituted a novus actus.
However, not every illegal act constitutes a novus actus, as in Rouse v
Squires (1973), where the court required a reckless, negligent act. The first

44

NEGLIGENCE

defendant caused a motorway accident and a second driver who was
driving too fast and failed to keep a proper look out collided with the
stationary vehicles. The first driver was held partially to be responsible
for the additional damage as the intervening conduct had not been so
reckless as to constitute a novus actus. This element of recklessness was
again required in Wright v Lodge (1993) where the first defendant negligently
left her car on the carriageway in thick fog. The second defendant was
deemed to be driving recklessly when he collided with the first defendant’s
car when driving at 60 mph before swerving across the carriageway and
crashing into several cars. It was held that the second driver’s recklessness
broke the chain of causation and the first defendant could not be held
liable for the damage suffered by the other drivers.
Knightley v Johns is hard to reconcile with Rouse v Squires and Wright
v Lodge and the differences arise as a result of policy decisions on the
part of the court. In the words of Stephenson LJ in Knightley v Johns, the
court looks at ‘common sense rather than logic on the facts and
circumstances of each case’.
Acts of the plaintiff

The plaintiff’s acts can constitute a novus actus, as in McKew v Holland
and Hannen and Cubitts (1969), the defendants had injured the plaintiff’s
left leg. One day, as the plaintiff was descending some stairs he felt that
his leg was about to give way so he jumped down the remaining stairs,
thereby injuring his right leg. The plaintiff’s act constituted a novus actus
as it had been an unreasonable act in the circumstances.
By contrast, in Wieland v Cyril Lord Carpets (1969), the plaintiff’s neck
had been injured by the defendants and as a consequence she was
required to wear a surgical collar. She fell as she had been unable to use
her bifocal spectacles with her usual skill and suffered further injuries.
The additional injuries were held to be attributable to the defendants
original negligence.
In Kirkham v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester (1990), it was held
that the suicide of a prisoner in police custody was not a novus actus.
The police were under a duty to guard the prisoner to prevent that type
of incident occurring.
The reasoning was followed in Reeves v Commissioner of Police for the
Metropolis (1998). This case also concerned a prisoner who committed
suicide in police custody. It was not a novus actus as, in the words of
Lord Bingham CJ, it was ‘the very thing against which the defendant
was duty bound to take precautions’.

45

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

This was upheld by the House of Lords, which held that a deliberate
act of suicide was not a novus actus. To hold as such would lead to the
absurd result that the very act the duty sought to prevent would be fatal
to establishing a causative link.

Remoteness of damage
Theoretically, the consequences of conduct are endless; so, even where
the defendant has breached a duty, there must be some ‘cut off’ point
beyond which the defendant will not be liable. If a defendant was
responsible for his actions ad infinitum, human activity would be
unreasonably hampered.
Since 1850, there have been two competing views as to the test for
remoteness of damage:
• consequences are too remote if a reasonable man would not have
foreseen them (The Wagon Mound (1967));
• the defendant is liable for all the direct consequences of his act suffered
by the plaintiff, whether a reasonable man would have foreseen them
or not, no matter how unusual or unexpected (Re Polemis and Furness,
Withy & Co Ltd (1921)).
The Wagon Mound lays down the rule that foreseeability of damage is the
test not only for the imposition of a duty of care but also for remoteness
of damage. Remember in this context we are looking at liability for the
extent of damage, not whether a duty exists.
Manner of occurrence of damage need not be foreseeable
If the type of injury is foreseeable, then the manner in which it occurs
need not be foreseeable (Hughes v Lord Advocate (1963)) but note that this
case was distinguished in Doughty v Turner Manufacturing Co Ltd (1964).
Type of injury must be foreseeable
In Tremain v Pike (1969), the plaintiff was a herdsman who was employed
by the defendants and he contracted Weil’s Disease, which is extremely
rare and is caught by coming into contact with rats’ urine. It was held
that injury through food contamination was foreseeable, a ‘rare disease’
was a different type of injury and was not therefore foreseeable.

46

NEGLIGENCE

However, the House of Lords in Page v Smith (1995) awarded damages
for psychiatric injury, even though only physical injury was foreseeable.
It was held that in the case of primary victims of nervous shock there
should be no distinction between physical and psychiatric injury.
Again, it was said by the Court of Appeal obiter in Giblett v P and NE
Murray Ltd (1999) that, where physical injury is foreseeable in an accident,
damages for consequent psychiatric injury were recoverable in principle.
Foreseeability of psychological harm need not be shown. On the facts
of the case, no causal link was established.
The extent of the damage need not be foreseeable ‘thin skull
rule’
Provided the type of injury is foreseeable, the defendant will be liable
for its full extent even if that is greater than could have been foreseen,
due to some peculiar susceptibility, for example, thin skull. This is a
residuary hangover from the days of Re Polemis.
So, in Bradford v Robinson Rentals (1967), a lorry driver was subject to
extreme cold and suffered frostbite as a result. The defendants were
liable even though the injury was greater than could have been foreseen
because the type of injury was foreseeable. This can be contrasted with
Tremain v Pike, where the type of injury had not been foreseeable.
Impecuniosity of the plaintiff
There is a duty in tort to mitigate one’s loss, that is, not increase one’s
loss unnecessarily. Problems arise where the defendant is too impecunious
to be able to afford to mitigate his loss. The courts have not always been
consistent in their approach. In Liesbosch Dredger v Edison SS (1933), the
plaintiff’s had been put to much greater expense in fulfilling a contract
because they were too poor to buy a substitute dredger for the one which
had been damaged by the defendants. It was held that the plaintiff’s
impecuniosity had to be disregarded and they were unable to recover
the additional expenses.
This can be contrasted with more recent cases such as Dodd Properties
Ltd v Canterbury CC (1980) and Martindale v Duncan where delays in
repair caused by impecuniosity and the cost of substitute hire vehicles
were allowed. It was said in Mattocks v Mann (1992) that The Liesbosch
was constantly being changed in the light of changed circumstances and
hire charges were again allowed.

Liability under the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957
Who is an ‘occupier’ for the purposes of the Act?
Common law rules apply

The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 does not define the term occupier but
stipulates that the rules of the common law shall apply (s 1(2)).
The test is one of control and not exclusive occupation

The basic test for an occupier is one of control over the premises. There
can also be more than one occupier of premises, at any given time (Wheat
v E Lacon & Co Ltd (1966)). The defendants owned a public house and
the manager and his wife occupied the upper floor. The manager’s wife
was allowed to take paying guests and one of these guests had an accident
on the staircase leading to the upper floor. It was held that the defendants
were occupiers of the upper floor as they exercised residuary control.
It was held in Bailey v Armes (1999) that the defendants who occupied
a flat that overlooked a flat roof that belonged to a supermarket, and
allowed their own children to climb onto the roof to play, did not exercise
sufficient control over the roof to be regarded as occupiers.
It is not necessary to be present on the premises

In Harris v Birkenhead Corporation (1976), the local authority had issued
a notice of compulsory purchase order and notice of entry but had not
taken possession. They were held to be occupiers.

49

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

What is a ‘visitor’ for the purposes of the Act?
General category of visitor

The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 replaces the old common law distinctions
between ‘invitees’ and ‘licensees’ and replaces it with a general category
of ‘visitor’.
Express and implied permission

A visitor is someone who has express or implied permission to be on
the land – either someone who has been expressly requested to enter
onto premises or has permission to be there.
Knowledge of presence does not imply permission

The fact that the occupier knows of the plaintiff’s presence or has failed
to take steps to prevent entry does not mean that the occupier has given
a licence (Edwards v Railway Executive (1952)).
Rules the same for children but may be a tacit licence

Knowledge that a track is constantly used by children together with a
failure to take any steps to indicate that passage is not permitted does
amount to a tacit licence (Lowery v Walker (1911)).
Entering premises to communicate with occupier does amount to tacit
licence

A person entering with the purpose of communicating with the employer
will have implied permission, for example, asking directions, the postman,
roundsman, etc.
Entering premises to exercise a right conferred by law amounts to licence

Section 2(6) stipulates that anyone entering premises for any purpose
in the exercise of a right conferred by law, are visitors, for example, police
with search warrants and officials empowered by statute to enter premises.
Exercising a public right of way does not constitute a licence

A person exercising a public right of way has no claim under the Occupiers’
Liability Act 1957 because such a person was not an ‘invitee’ or ‘licensee’
at common law.
In Greenhalgh v British Railways Board (1969), a railway bridge was built
by the defendant’s predecessor in title in 1873. In 1950, a housing estate
was built either side of the railway bridge and the bridge was used to
connect the two. The plaintiff was injured when he stepped in a pothole.
It was held that the plaintiff was exercising a right of way and was not
a ‘visitor’.
This has recently been confirmed by the House of Lords in the Northern
Irish case of McGeown v Northern Ireland Housing Executive (1994).
50

OCCUPIERS’ LIABILITY

National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949

Exercising rights under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside
Act 1949 does not confer the status of a visitor.
The common duty of care
The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 states that a common duty of care is
owed by an occupier to all visitors, except insofar as he has extended,
restricted, excluded or modified his duty.
The common duty of care is the duty to take such care as is reasonable
to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for
the purpose for which he is invited by the occupier to be there (s 2(2)).
The common duty of care under s 2(2) extends to design faults. In
Perry v Butlins Holiday World (1998), the plaintiff, who was three years
old at the time, fell on a low brick wall. The wall was capped with a
brick with a sharp edge, designed to protect the wall from frost and rain.
It was found that the wall could have been rounded and capped with
wood or rubber. It was held by the Court of Appeal that the lower the
structure the more likely that someone would fall on it and the top
surface should be made of appropriate materials.
Standard of care

The same standard of care as that which applies in ordinary negligence
applies.
Guidelines

The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 provides guidelines in the application
of the common duty of care. Section 2(3) provides that the circumstances
relevant for the purpose include the degree of care and want of care,
which would ordinarily be looked for in such a visitor, so that (for
example) in proper cases:
• an occupier must be prepared for children to be less careful than
adults;
• an occupier must expect that a person, in exercise of his calling, will
appreciate against any special risks ordinarily incident to his trade
or calling.
Children

An occupier must be prepared for children to be less careful than adults.
In Moloney v Lambeth LBC (1966), the occupier was liable when a four
year old boy fell through a gap in railings protecting a stairwell, when
an adult could not have fallen through the gap.

51

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Allurements

An occupier must take precautions against children being attracted by
allurements. In Glasgow Corporation v Taylor (1922), a seven year old boy
ate poisonous berries on a visit to a botanical garden. It was held that the
occupiers were liable as they knew that the berries were poisonous and
they had made no attempt to fence the berries off.
Definition of allurements

Allurements were defined by Hamilton LJ in Latham v R Johnson and
Nephew Ltd (1913) as something involving the idea of ‘concealment and
surprise, of an appearance of safety under circumstances cloaking a
reality of danger’. So, in that case, a child playing with a heap of stones
had no remedy, as stones do not involve any element of allurement. In
Phipps v Rochester Corporation (1955), a trench which was not concealed
was held not to be an allurement and, in Simkiss v Rhondda BC (1983),
there was no concealed danger in sliding down a steep bluff on a blanket
and, in Jolley v Sutton LBC (1998), the Court of Appeal ruled that a boat
in a dangerous condition was an allurement to a 14 year old.
The concept of ‘allurement’ does not make the occupier liable for
unforeseeable risks. In Jolley v Sutton LBC (1998), the occupier had left
a boat on land, which was a trap and attraction for children. The occupier
was only liable for those injuries, which were reasonably foreseeable
that children would play on an abandoned boat and might injure
themselves on it; it was not foreseeable that older children would attempt
to repair the boat by jacking it up. Consequently, the occupier was not
liable when the jacked up boat fell on a boy and injured him.
Skilled visitors

An occupier is entitled to expect that a person in the exercise of his calling
will appreciate and guard against any special risks incidental to his trade.
In Roles v Nathan (1963), two chimney sweeps died from carbon
monoxide poisoning while cleaning the flue of a boiler. They had been
warned not to continue working while the boiler was alight. The occupier
was held not to be liable as, first, they had been warned of the danger
and, secondly, it was reasonable to expect a specialist to appreciate and
guard against the dangers arising from the very defect that he had been
called in to deal with.
The risk must be incidental to the trade or calling

In Bird v King Line Ltd (1970), it was held that the risks of working on a
ship did not include falling on refuse which was carelessly left on the
deck.

52

OCCUPIERS’ LIABILITY

Occupier liability to skilled rescuers

In Ogwo v Taylor (1987), the occupier negligently started a fire and was
liable to a fireman injured in the fire where the fire fighting operation
has been carried out with due care.
Third parties

An occupier was held to be liable for the acts of third parties in Cunningham
v Reading FC (1991). The defendants were liable when rioting fans broke
lumps of concrete from a structure and used them as missiles, on the
basis that a prudent occupier would have done more to minimise the
risk.
Independent contractors
It will be a defence for the occupier to show that the defective state of
the premises is caused by the faulty execution of work of construction,
repair or maintenance by an independent contractor provided that:
• it was reasonable to entrust the work to an independent contractor;
• the occupier had taken reasonable care to see that the contractor was
competent;
• the occupier had taken reasonable care to check that the work was
reasonably done (s 2(4)(b)).
Reasonable to entrust work to a contractor

It depends on the circumstances and the nature of the work to be done
as to whether it was reasonable to entrust the work to a contractor.
The more complex the work the more reasonable it will be to entrust
it to a contractor. Thus, in Haseldine v CA Daw & Son Ltd (1941), an occupier
was not liable for the negligence of an independent contractor in
maintaining a lift in a block of flats. This can be contrasted with Woodward
v Mayor of Hastings (1945), where the occupiers were liable for the
negligence of a cleaner in leaving a step in an icy condition. Cleaning a
step does not require any particular skill.
Discharge of the duty of care
Warning

Section 2(4)(a) provides that an occupier can discharge his duty to a
visitor by giving a warning of the danger that in all the circumstances
allows the visitor to be reasonably safe.

53

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

The test for determining whether a warning was adequate is a subjective
one. A written warning will not be adequate in the case of someone who
is blind or cannot read or speak English.
In Staples v West Dorset DC (1995), it was held that an occupier had
not been negligent when the council had failed to provide a warning
and the danger was obvious. In such circumstances, a warning would
not have told the visitor anything he did not already know and would
not have affected his conduct.
In Whyte v Redland Aggregates Ltd (1997), the plaintiff struck his head
whilst diving into water in a disused gravel pit. The defendant had
placed ‘Danger, keep out’ signs but the plaintiff argued that ‘No swimming’
signs should have been erected and that there should have been a warning
of an uneven surface. It was held that the defendant’s duty did not
extend to putting up ‘No swimming’ signs or warning of the uneven
surface.
Acceptance of the risk

Section 2(5) provides that an occupier does not have an obligation to a
visitor in respect of risks willingly accepted by the visitor.
In Simms v Leigh Rugby Football Club Ltd (1969), the plaintiff had
accepted the risks of playing on a rugby league ground which conformed
to the by-laws of the Rugby League.
Knowledge of specific risk

In White v Blackmore (1972), it was held that it was insufficient to show
that the plaintiff knew that jalopy car racing was dangerous, it was
necessary to show that the plaintiff had consented to the specific risk
that made that particular track dangerous.
Exclusion of liability

Section 2(1) provides that an occupier is able to, ‘exclude, restrict or
modify his duty’. In Ashdown v Samuel Williams & Sons Ltd (1957), the
Court of Appeal accepted that a notice was sufficient to exclude liability.
In White v Blackmore, notices put at the entrance to the field were sufficient
to exclude liability.
Unfair Contract Terms Act

The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 has greatly restricted the occupiers
ability to exclude his liability.
Premises used for business premises

As far as premises used for business purposes are concerned the occupier
is unable to exclude liability for death and personal injury.

54

OCCUPIERS’ LIABILITY

Exclusion of liability for other types of loss must satisfy the reasonableness
test contained in s 7 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.
Premises used for private purposes

Occupiers of premises which are not in business use can only exclude
liability if such exclusion is reasonable.
Remoteness

The test for remoteness under the 1957 Act is the same that applies to a
common law action for negligence (Jolley v Sutton LBC (1998)).

Occupiers’ liability to trespassers
Common law rule
At common law, the original rule was that there was a mere duty not to
deliberately or recklessly injure a trespasser (Addie v Dumbreck (1929)).
There was a change of policy in the case of British Railways Board v
Herrington (1972) when it was held that an occupier was under a duty
to act humanely towards trespassers. This was owed when a reasonable
man knowing the physical facts which the occupier actually knew would
appreciate that a trespasser’s presence at the point and time of danger
was so likely that, in all the circumstances, it would be inhumane not
to give effective warning of the danger.
Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984
The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 replaces the common law to determine
whether an occupier owes a duty to persons other than visitors.
Under s 1(3) of the 1984 Act, a duty is owed if:
• he is aware of the danger or has reasonable grounds to believe that
it exists;
• he knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that the other person
is in the vicinity of the danger concerned, or that he may come into
the vicinity of danger (in either case whether the other has lawful
authority for being in the vicinity or not); and
• the risk is one against which in all the circumstances of the case he
may reasonably be expected to offer the other some protection.
Issues relating to the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 arose in the case of
Revill v Newbery (1995). The plaintiff was a trespasser attempting to break
into a brick shed on an allotment belonging to the defendant. The

55

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

defendant poked a shotgun through a small hole in the door and fired,
injuring the plaintiff. The defendant had no means of knowing whether
anyone was standing in front of the door. The plaintiff brought a claim
in assault; under s 1 of the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984, and negligence.
The claim for assault was dropped. Neill LJ argued that the Occupiers’
Liability Act 1984 did not apply. The defendant was not being sued in
his capacity as occupier with regard to the safety of the premises. The
case had to be decided in accordance with the ordinary principles of
negligence.
In Ratcliffe v McConnell (1998), the Court of Appeal decided that a
student who was seriously injured when he dived into a swimming pool
at 2 am when it was locked had consented to run the risk of injury under
s 1(6) of the 1984 Act.
To whom does the Act apply?
The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 applies to:
• trespassers;
• anyone exercising rights under the National Parks and Access to the
Countryside Act 1949;
• anyone exercising a private right of way.
Discharge of the duty
Warning

Section 1(5) provides that the duty may be discharged by taking such
steps as are reasonable in all the circumstances to warn of the danger
concerned, or to discourage persons from incurring risk.
In Cotton v Derbyshire Dales DC (1994), it was held that there was no
duty to warn against dangers that are obvious.
Exclusion of liability

The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 is silent on the question of whether
the duty can be excluded with regard to trespassers. It has been argued
that it is not possible to exclude a liability to a trespasser as it is a minimal
duty.

Personal non-delegable duties
Historical background
Doctrine of common employment

The case of Priestly v Fowler (1837) laid down the doctrine of common
employment. Under this doctrine, an employer was not liable to an
employee for a tort committed by a fellow employee. This was based
on the judicial fiction that an employee impliedly agreed to accept the
risks incidental to his employment, including the risk of negligence of
his fellow employees.

57

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

The courts had been heavily influenced by policy considerations that
if they permitted compensation for industrial accidents this would place
a heavy burden on employers.
Contributory negligence

Although under the doctrine the employee was said to take on the risk
of negligence by fellow employees, he did not take on the risk of his
employer being negligent and could sue his employer but only in the
absence of contributory negligence on the employee’s part.
Volenti non fit injuria

If an employee knew of the risk, he would be considered volenti non fit
injuria and again his claim would be defeated.
Unholy trinity

The combination of the doctrine of common employment, contributory
negligence and volenti non fit injuria became known as an ‘unholy trinity’
and prevented virtually all actions by employees.
Mitigating the harshness of common employment

Various devices were developed to mitigate the harshness of the doctrine
of common employment. The latter half of the 19th century saw a swing
in favour of the workman.
Breach of statutory duty

The case of Groves v Lord Wimborne (1898) held that an employer was
liable to a workman for an injury caused by a breach of statutory duty.
If a duty was placed on an employer by statute, the employer did not
escape liability if he delegated performance to another.
Volenti non fit injuria

It was held in Smith v Baker and Sons (1891) that the volenti defence would
rarely apply to employees, as they said that there had to be free consent
when the employee ran the risk.
No fault compensation

In 1897, an injured workman could receive compensation independently
of the law when a no fault compensation scheme for work accidents was
introduced by the Workman’s Compensation Act 1897. In 1948, the
National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946 came into force whereby
benefits became payable to victims of industrial diseases and virtually
everyone employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship became
entitled to benefits under the scheme. The National Insurance (Industrial
Injuries) Act 1946 has now been replaced by the Social Security Act 1975.

58

EMPLOYERS’ LIABILITY

Today, only 12.5% of those injured at work receive compensation
through the tort system.
Development of personal non-delegable duties

Although the principle was developed that an employer was liable to an
employee for his own negligence, this was increasingly of less use to
employees as the 19th century progressed since more and more people
were being employed by companies. To succeed under this principle, it
was necessary for there to be some element of ‘personal fault’ on the part
of the employer. It was impossible for there to be some personal fault on
the part of the employer where the employer was not a human being but
a limited company with independent legal personality.
Such an employer could only act through his servants and, if they
were negligent, the employer was not liable under the doctrine of common
employment.
Non-delegable personal duties were created and owed by the employer
to the employee. The employer remained responsible for the performance
of these duties even though performance may have been delegated to
an employee.
Duty to provide proper appliances

In the case of Smith v Baker and Sons, it was held that an employer owed
a duty to an employee to provide proper appliances, when Lord Herschell
said:
It is quite clear that the contract between employer and employed
involves on the part of the former the duty to take reasonable care
to provide proper appliances, and to maintain them in a proper
condition and so to carry on the operations as not to subject those
employed by him to unnecessary risk.
Development of a threefold duty

In the later case of Wilsons and Clyde Coal Co v English (1938), the duty
was said to be threefold, when Lord Wright said the duty was, ‘the
provision of a competent staff of men, adequate material, and a proper
system and effective supervision’. To add to these three duties, it has
also become clear from the cases that there is also a duty to provide safe
access to premises.
Abolition of the doctrine of common employment

The doctrine of common employment was abolished by s 1 of the Law
Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948. An employer can now be vicariously
liable to an employee for the negligence of a fellow employee.

59

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Continuing importance of the primary duties
Despite the abolition of the doctrine of common employment, the primary
duties still have an importance in two situations:
• an employer is only vicariously liable for torts committed ‘in the course
of employment’, of an employee. An employer may not be vicariously
liable for an employee’s tort, since it was not committed in the course
of employment but he could still have breached a primary duty;
• vicarious liability does not extend to an independent contractor but
an employer may still be liable to an employee where he has entrusted
work to an independent contractor.
Employer’s personal duties
Duty to provide competent staff

At common law, an employer owes a duty to an employee to select
competent fellow employees.
The duty has lost some of its importance since the abolition of the
doctrine of common employment but still retains its importance in one
area. The courts are reluctant to make employers vicariously liable for
the violent acts of an employee which are regarded as being outside the
course of employment. The same can be argued of acts of horseplay.
Both these examples may constitute breach of the primary duty to provide
competent staff.
An employer will have breached his primary duty where an employee
is injured by the foreseeable horseplay of a fellow employee. In Hudson
v Ridge Manufacturing Co Ltd (1957), an employer breached his primary
duty where an employee was injured by a fellow employee, who was a
notorious prankster. The employer should have put an end to the pranks.
An employer is not liable where the horseplay is unforeseeable. In
Smith v Crossley Bros (1951), the plaintiff suffered severe internal injuries
when a fellow apprentice approached him from behind and placed a
compressed air pipe close to his rectum and signalled to another employee
to switch on the compressed air. In this case, it was held that the employer
could not have foreseen that the apprentice would have done such a
thing.
Proper plant and equipment

It was laid down by Lord Herschell in Smith v Baker and Sons (1891) that
an employer has a ‘duty of taking reasonable care to provide proper
appliances, and to maintain them in a proper condition’.

60

EMPLOYERS’ LIABILITY

At common law, there was no employer ’s liability for defects in
manufacture. An employer was not liable for a defect in the manufacture
of a tool, when this defect could not have been discovered on a reasonable
inspection in Davie v New Merton Board Mills Ltd (1959).
Employers’ Liability (Defective Equipment) Act 1969

To circumvent the problem caused by the common law, the Employers’
Liability (Defective Equipment) Act 1969 was passed and an employer
is now liable for an injury to an employee suffered in the course of
employment as a result of a defect in a tool supplied by an employer
and the defect is attributable to the fault of a third party, whether
identifiable or not.
The Act relieves the employee of the need to identify and sue the
manufacturer, if the equipment is provided by the employer.
Proper use

It was held in Parkinson v Lyle Shipping Co (1964) that the employer will
not be liable where the employee has made improper use of the equipment.
Negligently choosing the wrong tool

In Leach v British Oxygen Co (1965), the employer was not liable where
the employee foolishly chose the wrong tool, assuming that the employee
had been given adequate instruction in the use of the equipment.
Meaning of equipment

The word ‘equipment’ was considered in Coltman v Bibby Tankers Ltd
(1988). The question raised by the case was whether a ship came within
the meaning of ‘equipment’ for the purposes of the Employers’ Liability
(Defective Equipment) Act 1969. The Court of Appeal held that it was not
equipment because equipment was ancillary to something else and did
not encompass the workplace. The House of Lords rejected this test and
held that equipment did not have to be part of a larger whole and that
there was no reason to exclude ships from the Act.
The House of Lords in Knowles v Liverpool CC (1993) held that the
Employers’ Liability (Defective Equipment) Act 1969 was to be widely
construed and embraced every article provided by the employer for the
purpose of the business. So a flagstone came within the meaning of the
Act.
Safe place of work

This duty was not expressly mentioned by Lord Wright in Wilsons and
Clyde Coal Co v English (1938). However, it is clear that the employer’s

61

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

duty extends to providing a safe place of work and that this is a higher
duty than that laid down in the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957.
Means of access

In Ashdown v Samuel Williams and Son Ltd (1957), it was held that the
duty extended to providing a safe means of access to the place of work.
Duty is discharged with reasonable care

The employer in Latimer v AEC Ltd (1953) was held to have taken reasonable
care when he sprinkled a slippery factory floor with sawdust.
Duty not discharged by a warning

An employer did not discharge his duty by giving a warning in London
Graving Dock Co v Horton (1951). Nor can an employer argue that the
plaintiff was familiar with the danger and made no complaint (McCafferty
v Metropolitan Police District Receiver (1977)).
Temporary danger

It was said in relation to temporary danger in OÕReilly v National Rail
and Tramways Appliances Ltd (1966) that, in cases of temporary danger,
the reasonableness of the employer’s conduct would depend on the
degree of the risk and the employer’s knowledge of the risk.
Third party premises

At one time, the employer was thought not to be liable where the employee
was working on premises that belonged to a third party.
It was held in Wilson v Tyneside Window Cleaning Co (1958) that an
employer could be liable where the employee was working on third
party premises. The steps required to discharge that duty will depend
on the circumstances:
The master’s own premises are under his control: if they are dangerously
in need of repair he can and must rectify the fault at once. But if a
master sends his plumber to mend a leak in a private house, no one
could hold him negligent for not visiting the house himself to see
if the carpet in the hall creates a trap. Between these two extremes
are countless possible examples in which the court must decide the
question of fact: Did the master take reasonable care?

The duty does not extend to injuries caused by a defective floor in
premises occupied by another employer when the employee was working
in Saudi Arabia (Square D Ltd v Cook (1992)). There was no reason for
the employer to suppose that the employer in Saudi Arabia was anything
other than competent. This seems to create an exception to the rule that
the duties are non-delegable.

62

EMPLOYERS’ LIABILITY

Safe system of work

Whether an operation needs a safe system of work or can be left to a
particular employee is a question of fact.
Regular or routine work

It was held in Speed v Thomas Swift and Co (1943) that the duty will
normally apply in respect of a system of working which is regular or
routine.
Single tasks

The duty can apply to a single task, where it is complicated or highly
dangerous or prolonged or involves a number of men performing a
number of different functions (Winter v Cardiff RDC (1950)).
Employer must check that the system is complied with

In General Cleaning Contractors v Christmas (1953), it was held that the
employer must check that the system is being complied with. Although
Lord Denning said that this was a proposition of good sense, so, for
example, if a workman is provided with protective clothing it is not
necessary to check that he actually wears it. In the words of Viscount
Simmonds: ‘I deprecate any tendency to treat the relation of employer
and skilled workman as equivalent to that of nurse and imbecile child.’
Psychiatric damage

It was held in Walker v Northumberland CC (1994) that the duty to provide
a safe system of work includes a duty to take care of the employee’s
psychiatric, as well as physical, well being. The plaintiff had a nervous
breakdown when trying to cope with an increased workload. On his
return to work, he advised his superior that assistance would be required.
An assistant was provided but helped intermittently and after a period
of one month was unable to assist at all. The plaintiff then suffered a
second breakdown and was unable to return to work. The defendant
argued that it was not foreseeable that the plaintiff’s work would impose
such stress as to cause mental illness. It was held that the defendant was
liable for the second breakdown, as it was a foreseeable consequence of
the failure to relieve the pressure of work.
An employer was also liable for negligently causing psychiatric injury
to employees in Frost v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire (1996).
Secondary employer

An employer who lends an employee to another employer was entitled
to a complete indemnity against that employer for failure to provide
suitable equipment and a safe system of work for the employee (Needhams

63

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

v Sandells Maintenance Ltd (1995)). Although the employee can sue either
employer, the first employer has a right of indemnity from the second.
Window cleaning

It was held in King v Smith (1994) that a window cleaner’s customer
should be made responsible for ensuring that where windows are capable
of being cleaned from the inside, that they should be in proper working
order to allow that to be done. The employee should also have been
instructed by his employer not to clean windows from the outside where
they were capable of being cleaned from the inside, if they had been in
proper working order.
Battle conditions

In Mulcahy v Ministry of Defence (1996), a gun commander, during the
Gulf War, negligently ordered the firing of a gun, thereby injuring the
plaintiff. It was held that there was no duty in battle conditions to maintain
a safe system of work.
Economic benefit of employees

The personal duties provide protection for the physical well being of
employees. It is clear from Reid v Rush and Tomkins Group plc (1989) that
the economic welfare of employees is not so well protected. The plaintiff
was employed by the defendants and was sent to work in Ethiopia where
he suffered severe injuries in a road accident caused by the negligence
of another driver. After he failed to receive compensation, he argued
that the defendants should have advised him to take out insurance. It
was held that no duty existed to protect an employee against economic
loss, although it may arise out of a particular set of facts, for example,
a Hedley Byrne relationship.

Breach of statutory duty
Breach of statutory duty is the second head of liability an employer may
have at common law. It is an entirely separate tort from negligence
(considered more fully in the next chapter) and has been consistently
allowed in the field of industrial safety, in marked contrast to other areas.
Its use began as a way of mitigating the harshness of the rule of
common employment. Whereas the primary duties exist generally,
wherever the employer – employee relationship exists, there is no such
generalisation with statutory duties and the duty depends on the statute.

64

EMPLOYERS’ LIABILITY

Health and Safety at Work Act 1974

The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 consolidated many existing
health and safety statutes. The Act imposes a number of general duties
on employers. General duties have been added to by the Health and
Safety at Work Regulations 1992. Breach of these duties gives rise to a
penal sanction and a civil right of action is expressly excluded.
The 1974 Act gives the Secretary of State the power to bring forward
regulations to cover the specific areas which are dealt with by existing
legislation. Breach of the specific duties will give rise to a right to a civil
action for breach of statutory duty, unless the regulation expressly states
otherwise. In January 1993, six regulations became effective in the UK as
a result of EC directives and have become known as the ‘six pack’. These
add to the list of specific statutory duties in respect of specific dangers.
Defective equipment

Employers are strictly liable for injuries to employees caused by defective
equipment under the Employers’ Liability (Defective Equipment) Act
1969.
Factories Act 1961

This consolidates earlier Factories Acts. Sections 12–16 cover the fencing
of machinery and the rule is that ‘every dangerous part’ must be fenced.
It was held in Davies v Thomas Owen and Co (1919) that this is an absolute
duty.

Vicarious liability
Vicarious liability exists when A is liable to C for damages caused by B.
Thus it is liability for actions of another. The most important instance
of vicarious liability is that of employer and employee.
Who is an employee?
The courts have used various criteria in deciding the difficult question
of whether a tortfeasor is an employee for the purposes of vicarious
liability. If the employee fails to come within the criteria then the tortfeasor
will not be an employee but an independent contractor for whom with
exceptions, the employer is not vicariously liable:
• employee – contract for service;
• independent contractor – contract for services;

65

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

• certain criteria are to be taken into account in cases where uncertainty
exists.
Intention of the parties

This is relevant but not conclusive, even if the contract expressly states
that the worker is an independent contractor.
In Ferguson v Dawson Partners (Contractors) Ltd (1976), the contract of a
building worker stated that a worker was ‘labour only sub-contractor’
but was, nevertheless, held to be an employee because he was treated as
an employee for all other purposes.
‘The control test’

The traditional test is in terms of control, that is, degree of control. Where
substantial control of the working conditions of the worker are being
exercised, the more likely it is that the worker is an employee. However,
this will not apply to the same extent with skilled workers. For example,
a hospital does not control a surgeon in the performance of an operation.
Integration within the business

The extent to which a worker is ‘integral’ to the business or merely
‘accessory’ to it may be the deciding factor, per Lord Denning in Stevenson
Jordan and Harrison Ltd v MacDonald and Evans (1952). If a worker is
integral, then he will be an employee; if the worker is an accessory, then
he is an independent contractor.
Allocation of financial risks

As a general rule, employees work for a wage which is calculated by
reference to the time worked. Employees are not required to run the risk
of financial loss and they do not share in the profits.
In Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd v Minister of Pensions and
National Insurance (1968), a company organised its deliveries through
owner drivers. The drivers were required to buy their vehicles on HP
from an associated finance company, vehicles had to be painted in the
company colours, the ‘owner-driver’ could not alter, charge or sell the
vehicle without the company’s permission and the company had an
option to purchase the vehicle, it could not be used for private purposes
and the ‘owner-driver’ had to comply with the rules and regulations of
the company.
It was held that despite the extensive control exercised over the ‘ownerdrivers’ the terms were more consistent with a contract of carriage rather
than a contract of service. Particular emphasis was placed on the fact

66

EMPLOYERS’ LIABILITY

that the ‘owner-driver’ had to make the vehicle available throughout
the contract period at his own expense and the chance of profit or risk
of loss was the driver’s.
Changing nature of employment
The changing nature of employment is making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish between an employee and someone who is self-employed.
In Lane v Shire Roofing Company (Oxford) Ltd (1995), the plaintiff had been
self-employed but his business encountered difficulties. He agreed to
work for the defendants under a large sub-contract they had obtained.
He was injured when he fell off a ladder.
There were indications pointing both ways. First, the defendant was
a new company and did not wish to take on employees. Secondly, the
plaintiff was in business on his own account and was capable of working
without supervision. Thirdly, there was no guarantee of more work and
no provision for notice or dismissal.
Henry LJ paid regard to the changing nature of the employment
market and the growth in flexible working. He asked the question: whose
business is it? On this basis, he held that it was the defendant’s and that
the plaintiff was an employee.
However, it is hard to see any new general principles emerging. In
McMeechen v Secretary of State for Employment (1995), the plaintiff worked
for an employment agency. He was described as self-employed. On the
other hand, he was paid weekly and the terms of his contract seemed
to accord with that of an employee. He was held to be self-employed.
In Hornsby v Clark Kenneth Leventhal (1998), the plaintiff had lost several
million pounds after investing in a fund fraudulently run by an employee
of the defendant. Although the defendants employed the fraudster, he
made payments of £750 per month to the defendants, representing half
his salary, to compensate them for the time he spent and expenses he
incurred on private matters during working hours and the fraud was
perpetrated as part of his private business. The plaintiff contended that
as a receiver of the employee’s private income the defendants were
vicariously liable. It was held that, although the employment gave the
fraudster respectability and might have facilitated the fraud, this was
not sufficient to imply vicarious liability.

67

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Employees on loan
A problem arises when an employee is lent by one employer to another.
Which one is liable for the acts of the employee?
In Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Coggins and Griffith (1946), a crane
driver was lent by a harbour authority to a firm of stevedores. The
conditions of hire stated that the crane driver was to be considered a
servant of the stevedores but they had no power to tell the driver how
to work his crane. It was held that the harbour authority was liable for
the crane driver’s negligence.
Course of employment
The tort must be committed in the course of the employee’s employment.
This is a question of fact. One test is that an act is within the course of
employment if it is either:
• a wrongful act authorised by the employer; or
• a wrongful and unauthorised mode of doing some authorised act.
Carelessness of employee

If the employer is doing the job he is authorised to do but contrary to
the manner in which he has been instructed to do it, then the employer
will be vicariously liable. In Whatman v Pearson (1868), the employer
instructed his employees that they were not to go home or leave their
horses during their dinner break. An employee went home and, in his
absence, his horse damaged the plaintiff’s property.
In Storey v Ashton (1869), an employer was not liable for a negligently
caused road accident because at the time of the accident his employee
had taken a detour to transact some private business.
Similarly, in Crook v Derbyshire Stone Ltd (1956), an employer whose
employee negligently caused an accident in his meal break was not liable
for the acts of the employee.
Violence by employee

An employer will not be liable for the violent acts of an employee as
they are outside the course of employment. In Warren v Henlys Ltd (1948),
a pump attendant hit a customer whom he wrongly suspected of not
paying. It was held to be an act of personal vengeance and therefore
outside the course of employment.
This can be contrasted with the case of Daniels v Whetstone Entertainments
(1962), where a bouncer who was authorised to use such force as was

68

EMPLOYERS’ LIABILITY

necessary inside a night club, hit someone during the course of a fracas
inside the night club and then followed the person outside and hit them
again. It was held that the second act was outside the course of employment.
An employee is also entitled to use reasonable force in defence of
person or property. In Poland v Parr & Sons (1927), an off duty employee
saw some boys apparently stealing from one of his employer’s wagons.
He stuck one of the boys who fell and was run over. It was held that an
employee has an implied authority to act for the protection of his
employer’s property.
Express prohibition

Here it is necessary to distinguish between the employee doing his job
in a manner in which he has been instructed not to do it, for which the
employer will be vicariously liable and performing a task which the
employee has been told is outside the scope of his job.
So, the employer was liable in Limpus v London General Omnibus Co
(1862) when the employee raced his vehicle and obstructed another
vehicle, when the employee had been instructed not to do this, as it was
an unauthorised mode of performing an authorised act.
Contrast that case with Iqbal v LTE (1973) where a bus conductor had
been told on many occasions not to move buses and the employer was
consequently not liable when the conductor injured someone while
moving a bus in the depot. Driving was outside the scope of the conductor’s
employment.
The House of Lords held in Racz v Home Office (1993) that the Home
Office would be vicariously liable for acts of prison officers that amounted
to misfeasance in public office unless the acts were so unconnected with
their authorised duties as to be independent of and outside them, which
is a question of fact and degree.
Theft and fraud

Employers are liable for acts of theft and fraud committed by employees.
In Morris v CW Martin & Sons Ltd (1966), a firm of dry cleaners were
liable for the theft of a coat by an employee.
Similarly, in Lloyd v Grace Smith & Co (1912), a firm of solicitors were
liable for the fraud of a managing clerk who fraudulently conveyed
properties belonging to a client to himself.
Master’s indemnity
There is an implied term in an employee’s contract of employment that
the employee will exercise reasonable care when performing his duties.
Where an employee’s negligence leads to an employer ’s vicarious

69

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

liability, then, at common law, the employer is entitled to be indemnified
for the loss attributable to the employee’s breach of contract.
In Lister v Romford Ice and Coal Storage Co Ltd (1957), the defendant
was an employee of the plaintiff and had injured another employee, the
defendant’s father. The defendant’s father obtained damages against
the plaintiff who then sought to be indemnified by the defendant. It was
held that the plaintiff was entitled to this indemnity.

Liability for independent contractors
General rule
The general rule is that an employer is not liable for the torts of an
independent contractor. The rationale for this rule is that an employer
does not exercise control over an independent contractor. There are a
number of important exceptions to this rule.
Exceptions to the general rule
Authorised or ratified tort

Ellis v Sheffield Gas Consumers (1853) is authority for the proposition that
the employer will be a joint tortfeasor where he has authorised or ratified
the tort.
Negligence in choosing the contractor

Pinn v Rew (1916) is authority for the proposition that an employer will
be liable if he negligently chooses an independent contractor, fails to
instruct him properly or fails to check the work where he is competent
to do so.
Non-delegable duties imposed by common law
Rule in Rylands v Fletcher

Rylands v Fletcher is a rule of strict liability and the employer will be
liable for the acts of an independent contractor.
Extra hazardous operations

Where the independent contractor is involved in an extra hazardous
activity, which has been defined as something which involves the risk
of special danger to others, then the employer will be liable (Honeywill
and Stein Ltd v Larkin Bros Ltd (1934)).

70

EMPLOYERS’ LIABILITY

Liability for fire

In Balfour v Barty-King (1957), the defendant negligently thawed pipes
with a blow lamp, thus negligently setting fire to the plaintiff’s property.
The defendant was held liable for the contractor’s negligence.
Operations which are on or contiguous to the highway

In Tarry v Ashton (1876), the defendant’s lamp which projected over the
highway fell and injured the plaintiff. The fact that the defendant had
delegated repair of the lamp to an independent contractor was no defence.
Common law duties owed by an employer to an employee

These duties are personal and cannot be delegated.
Non-delegable duties imposed by statute

Strict and absolute duties imposed under statute are non-delegable, for
example, the Factories Act 1961.
Bailee for reward

A bailee for reward who entrusts goods to an independent contractor,
remains liable for any loss or damage to the goods, in the absence of a
contractual provision to the contrary (Morris v CW Martin and Sons Ltd
(1966)).
No liability for collateral negligence

For the employer to be liable, the tortiously performed act of the
independent contractor must be one he was employed to do and not an
act unconnected with what he was employed to do (Padbury v Holliday
and Greenwood Ltd (1912)).

4 Breach of Statutory Duty
You should be familiar with the following areas:
• Lord Denning’s test in Ex p Island Records
• reaffirmation of the traditional test in Lonrho v Shell Petroleum
Co Ltd (No 2)
• exceptions where civil right of action will be allowed, rule is
for the benefit of a class where an individual has suffered
particular damage
• the elements of breach of statutory duty
• defences of voluntary assumption of the risk; contributory
negligence and act of a third party
• proposals for reform

Original principle
The early cases on breach of statutory duty rested on a broad principle
that whenever a violation of a statute caused damage to an individual’s
interests a right of action in tort arose.
Recent attempts to resurrect broad principle
Lord Denning MR attempted to resurrect the broad principle in Ex p
Island Records (1978) when he said that whenever a private right had
been interfered with, causing an individual special damage over and
above that suffered by the rest of the public, then he would have a civil
right of action.
If the ‘broad Denning principle’ had been accepted, then it would have
transformed actions for breach of statutory duty and allowed greater
protection of economic and business interests by the law of tort.

73

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Reaffirmation of the narrower principle
The House of Lords rejected the broad principle in the case of Lonrho v
Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No 2) (1981) and reasserted the general rule that
‘where an act creates an obligation and enforces performance in a specified
manner ... that performance cannot be enforced in any other manner’.
There are two classes of exception to the general rule. First, where it can
be seen that the obligation has been imposed for the benefit of a class
of people, such as employees. Secondly, where an individual suffers
particular damage over and above the rest of the public when a public
right has been infringed.
So, in answer to the question, ‘Does the statute give rise to civil
liability?’, the possibilities are as follows:
• the statute in question may state that civil liability will or will not
arise from a breach of the Act, if so, then it is clear whether civil liability
arises; or
• the Act is silent on the question of civil liability and it will then be a
question of construction of the statute to determine if civil liability
exists. Where there is a remedy laid down in the statute, there will
be a presumption that no civil liability exists, unless the case comes
within the two exceptions of the obligation being for the benefit of a
class or an individual who has suffered particular damage over and
above that suffered by the rest of the public. It was held in Issa v
Hackney LBC that Parliament must have intended to create a civil
remedy when the Act was passed.

Statutory remedy
As a general rule, if the Act provides a remedy, then this is the only
remedy permitted. This tends to exclude many statutes which are criminal
in nature and provide for some type of penalty.
In Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (1981), the House of Lords
approved the general rule laid down by Lord Tenterden CJ in Doe d
Bishop of Rochester v Bridges (1831), namely, that ‘where an act creates an
obligation, and enforces the performance in a specified manner ... that
performance cannot be specified in any other manner’.
An illustration of the working of this rule can be seen in Atkinson v
Newcastle Waterworks Co (1877) when a penalty of £10 existed for a breach
of the Waterworks Clauses Act 1847 for failure to maintain sufficient
water pressure which precluded the plaintiff from bringing an action

74

BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY

for breach of statutory duty, when his premises burnt down because
there was no water. The fine provided the method of enforcement of the
duty.
A rather different line was taken in Groves v Lord Wimborne (1898)
where an employee was able to bring a civil action even though there
was a penalty of up to £100 for breach of the duty. The court was influenced
by the fact that there was no requirement to apply the penalty in favour
of the defendant and the set limit might be insufficient to compensate
the plaintiff fully. The employer-employee relationship has been one
area where the courts have been willing to allow actions for breach of
statutory duty, principally because health and safety legislation is
considered to be for the benefit of a class, that is, employees.
Rights of appeal from a decision through administrative channels
with an ultimate right of judicial review constitutes a remedy (E v Dorset
CC; Christmas v Hampshire CC; Keating v Bromley LBC (1994)). The statutory
code providing for the identification, assessment and assistance for
children with special education needs under the Education Acts 1944
and 1981 and regulations made thereunder did not give rise to a right
of action for breach of statutory duty since there was an appeal procedure
open to parents who wished to challenge decisions. If parents were not
satisfied with the appeals procedure they could apply for judicial review.

Common law remedy
Where a common law remedy is available, then it is felt that the courts
should not admit civil liability for breach of statutory duty. Authority
for this can be found in Phillips v Britannia Hygienic Laundry Co Ltd (1923).
However, an action for breach of statutory duty will be allowed where
it supplements the common law. In Monk v Warbey (1935), the defendant
allowed an uninsured driver to drive his car contrary to s 35 of the Road
Traffic Act 1930. The driver negligently injured the plaintiff but the
judgment remained unsatisfied. The plaintiff was allowed to succeed
against the defendant.
Two further aspects of the incidence of an action for breach of statutory
duty were raised by way of exceptions to the general rule for breach of
statutory duty by Lord Diplock in the Lonrho Ltd case:
• where the obligation/prohibition was imposed for the benefit or
protection of a class of individuals; and
• where the statute creates a public right and an individual member of
the public suffers ‘particular damage’.

75

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Benefit of a class
Where the statute was passed for the benefit of an ascertainable class of
individuals, the presumption is that an action will lie, per Lord Diplock
in Lonrho Ltd.
The purpose of the Dramatic and Musical Performers’ Protection Act
1958 in Rickless v United Artists Corporation (1988) was found to be the
protection of performers’ rights and financial interests. The plaintiffs
could therefore bring an action for the unauthorised use of clips from
old Peter Sellers’ films.
Recent cases have shown that there must be an intention on the part
of the legislature to confer on the class a right for damages for the breach.
Lord Bridge in Pickering v Liverpool Daily Post and Echo Newspapers plc
(1991) said:
... it must ... appear upon the true construction of the legislation in
question that the intention was to confer on members of the protected
class a cause of action sounding in damages occasioned by the breach.

This followed similar dicta by Lord Bridge in Calveley v Chief Constable
of the Merseyside Police (1989).
In Hague v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison and Weldon v Home
Office (1991), prisoners who had suffered injury as a result of breaches
of the Prison Rules could not bring an action for breach of statutory duty.
The aim of the Prison Act 1952 (under which the regulations had been
made) was to deal with the management and control of prisons and
prisoners. The aims were wider than simply the protection of prisoners.
Lord Jauncey compared the Prison Act to the Factories Acts where the
main aim had been the protection of the health and safety of employees
and the duty could therefore be said to be for the benefit of a class.
The House of Lords again stated the rules in X v Bedfordshire CC; M v
Newham LBC and Keating v Bromley LBC (1995). Local authorities had
breached their duties to protect children under the Children and Young
Persons Act 1969, the Child Care Act 1980, the Children Act 1989 and
the Education Acts 1944 and 1981. Such duties are designed to protect
children but a right of action for breach of statutory duty did not arise,
as there was no parliamentary intention to confer a private right of action
on that class.
The principles laid down in Hague and X v Bedfordshire CC were
followed in Olotu v Home Office (1996). The plaintiff had been committed
for trial and was held in custody for 112 days. At the expiry of 112 days,
the Crown Prosecution Service failed to bring her before the Crown
Court to have the period extended and she spent 81 days in prison in

76

BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY

excess of the time limit. It was said that the object of the Prosecution of
Offences Act 1985 and the Prosecution of Offences (Custody Time Limits)
Regulations 1987 was to expedite the prosecution of criminal offences
and to ensure, if expedition was lacking, that defendants did not languish
in prison for excessive periods awaiting trial. There was, however, nothing
to suggest that Parliament intended to create new private law rights of
action.
Public right where particular damage suffered
Lord Diplock’s second exception was where the statute creates a public
right and an individual member of the public suffers ‘particular damage’.
It is not exactly clear how this category is to be identified.

Elements of the tort
Duty imposes an obligation on the defendant
The statute imposes an obligation on the defendant. This includes
obligations imposed under the EC Treaty. In Garden Cottage Foods Ltd v
Milk Marketing Board (1984), a breach of Art 86 which prohibits abuse of
a dominant position by a company gave rise to a right for breach of
statutory duty.
Duty must be owed to the plaintiff
In Hartley v Mayoh (1954), a fire broke out in the factory premises of the
first defendants. On arrival at the scene, one of the officers of the fire
brigade went to locate the main electrical switches in order to cut off the
electric supply to the premises. He was directed to the main switchboard
by the factory manager and switched off two master switches but was
not directed to two smaller switches.
The effect was that the electrical current was not switched off to the
entire premises. One of the fire officers was electrocuted and died. His
widow sued for negligence and for breach of statutory duty.
The statutory duty was expressed to be owed to ‘persons employed’.
As the fireman was not an employee, he was not a person for whose
benefit the duty had been made and an action did not lie for breach of
statutory duty.

77

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Injury should be of a kind the statute is intended to
prevent
The leading case is Gorris v Scott (1874). A statutory order required parts
of a ship occupied by animals to be divided into pens of a specified size.
The defendant violated this order and the plaintiff’s sheep were washed
overboard. The order was intended to prevent the spread of disease, not
to prevent animals from being drowned, so an action for breach of
statutory duty failed.
The harm suffered by the plaintiff must be within the general class
of risks at which the statute is directed. For example, the duty imposed
on highway authorities to repair roads is to protect road users from
injury. Consequently, there cannot be a right of action where the poor
state of repair leads to loss of profits for a local trader (Wentworth v
Wiltshire CC (1993)).
There must be a breach of statute
It was held in Chipcase v British Titan Products (1956) that a statutory duty
which applied to platforms of more than 6 ft 6 in from the ground does
not apply to a platform that is only 6 ft from the ground. No breach, no
action.
The breach must have caused the damage
It is for the plaintiff to show that the breach caused the damage. In Ginty
v Belmont Building Supplies (1959), the plaintiff was employed by the first
defendant to replace the asbestos sheeting on the second defendant’s
roof. The Building (Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations 1948 required
boards not only to be provided but to be (vicariously) used. The plaintiff
was told where he could obtain duckboards. When he was seen not to
be using them they were put out for his use. The plaintiff fell and sustained
injury.
It was held that the plaintiff could not recover damages as the accident
had been his own fault.

78

BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY

Defences
Relationship between criminal and tortious liability
Breaches of particular statutory duties may give rise both to criminal
and tortious proceedings. It must not, however, be assumed that the
defences in each case are identical.
Assumption of risk
It was held in Wheeler v New Merton Board Mills Ltd (1933) that volenti
non fit injuria is not a defence to an action brought by an employee for
breach of a statutory duty by an employer. Wheeler was approved by the
House of Lords in Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd v Shatwell (1965) but
it added that the defence of volenti should be available where the employer
had not himself or vicariously breached the statutory duty.
Contributory negligence
At common law, contributory negligence was a defence. Apportionment
of damages is now available under the Law Reform (Contributory
Negligence) Act 1945.
Particular problems arise in the employer-employee relationship. In
carrying out duties under health and safety legislation, employers are
supposed to take into account that people through constant repetition
become careless for their own safety.
It was held in Boyle v Kodak Ltd (1969) that where the employer had
delegated performance of the duty and the employer can prove that the
only reason why the Act has not been complied with is because the
plaintiff’s act or default, then that is a good defence, even where the
employer is under strict liability.
Act of third party
This is not a defence where the statute imposes strict liability on the
defendant.

79

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Proposals for reform
In 1969, the Law Commission in the Interpretation of Statutes
recommended a single reform. Actions for breach of statutory duty
would have to be specifically excluded in the Act, even where there is
a remedy for the Act’s enforcement.

80

5 Intentional Interference
with the Person
You should be familiar with the following areas:
•
•
•
•

the elements of trespass
the elements of assault, battery and false imprisonment
the defences to trespass to the person
the rule in Wilkinson v Downton

Intentional interference with the person – trespass
Battery
Battery is the intentional and direct application of unlawful force by one
person to another.
Intentional

There does not have to be an intention to commit a harm or battery;
there merely has to be an intention to commit the requisite interference
with the plaintiff’s person. It does have to be an intentional invasion or
interference, as opposed to merely negligent.
In Letang v Cooper (1965), the plaintiff was sunbathing in the car park
of an hotel and the defendant drove his car over her legs, injuring her.
It was held that the plaintiff could not succeed in trespass, as the defendant’s
behaviour had been unintentional. The old distinction between trespass
and case had been replaced by a distinction between trespass (which
lay for intentional, direct invasions of the plaintiff’s interest and which
was actionable per se) and negligence (which lay for all negligent invasions
direct or indirect and which was only actionable upon proof of actual
injury or damage, per Lord Denning).
The general principle is that, to establish an action in trespass, intention
must be proved rather than mere negligence.

81

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Direct

The traditional example used to illustrate the difference between direct
and indirect harm is that of a man who throws a log onto the highway.
If the log strikes someone, the injury is direct and trespass would lie but,
if it simply obstructs the highway and someone trips over it, the injury
is indirect and the plaintiff would have to sue in negligence and prove
damage.
This requirement that the force be ‘direct’ is clear enough in the
example but is not always so easy to draw.
A continuation of the defendant’s act will constitute trespass

In Scott v Shepherd (1773), a lighted squib was thrown by the defendant,
which finally exploded in front of the plaintiff, having been thrown by
X and Y, who both acted instinctively for their own preservation. The
defendant was liable in trespass as the actions of X and Y had been
continuations of his own act. So, the act must be direct and, therefore,
it is not battery to poison another’s drink, or to dig a hole intending
another person to fall in it, even though in each case the intended harm
occurs.
Unlawful force

No one can touch someone else without his consent or lawful justification.
It seems that only the slightest physical contact is required and no actual
hurt need result. In the words of Holt CJ ‘the least touching of another
in anger is a battery’.
This rule is subject to two possible qualifications:
• certain forms of contact are considered unavoidable and the generally
accepted consequence of social intercourse and therefore not actionable,
for example, the jostling that takes place in a busy shop or street. All
this is reasonable if kept within acceptable bounds. These instances
tend to be considered ‘implied consent’ although in Collins v Wilcock
(1984) they were regarded as ‘falling within a general exception
embracing all physical contact which is generally acceptable in the
ordinary conduct of daily life’;
• the second qualification stems from the decision of the Court of Appeal
in Wilson v Pringle (1986). A schoolboy was carrying a bag over his
shoulder when another schoolboy pulled at the bag, causing him to
fall and suffer injury to his hip. The defendant maintained that it was
just an act of horseplay and that the essential ingredients of trespass
to the person were a deliberate touching, hostility and an intention

82

INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH THE PERSON

to inflict injury. The plaintiff said that there just had to be an intentional
application of force.
It was held that an intention to injure was not an essential ingredient of
the action for trespass to the person, since it was the mere trespass by
itself which was the offence and therefore it was the act rather than the
injury which had to be intentional. But, the intentional act had to be
proved to be a ‘hostile touching’ which was a question of fact and could
not be equated with ‘ill will or malevolence’.
Wilson was doubted by Lord Goff (obiter) in F v West Berkshire AHA
(1989). He argued that a prank that got out of hand, an over-friendly
slap on the back or surgical treatment by a surgeon who mistakenly
believes that a patient has consented to it may all constitute battery even
though there is no element of hostility in the touching. Lord Goff defined
battery as any deliberate touching of another’s body, beyond the bounds
of acceptable everyday conduct, which lacks lawful excuse. This is the
preferred view of academic writers.
Lord Goff also suggested that the interest that battery protects is not
only freedom from physical injury but also from any form of physical
molestation. So it protects against affronts to insult or indignity caused
by physical touching. On this basis, an unwanted kiss or spitting at the
plaintiff can constitute a battery.
Assault
Assault is the act of the defendant which causes the plaintiff reasonable
apprehension of the infliction of a battery on him by the defendant.
Relationship of assault and battery
An assault is an act which causes another person to apprehend the
infliction of immediate, unlawful force on his person; a battery is
the actual infliction of unlawful force on another person [Collins v
Wilcock (1984)].

For example, riding a horse at a person constitutes an assault but riding
against him constitutes a battery. Consequently, it is possible for there
to be an assault and not a battery. In Stephens v Myers (1830), the defendant
threatened the plaintiff and moved towards him with a clenched fist but
he was prevented from reaching the plaintiff by someone else.
The threat must be sufficient to put the plaintiff in reasonable
apprehension of an immediate battery. The plaintiff does not have to
show that he was actually frightened. The test is whether it would have

83

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

been reasonable to apprehend the infliction of a battery. Conversely,
there can be a battery without an assault, for example, when someone
is struck from behind or while asleep.
Where threats of violence or abuse cannot be carried out, then assault
cannot be committed, for example, in Thomas v National Union of Mineworkers
(South Wales Area) (1985), there were violent gestures by picketing miners
to working miners in passing vehicles but the picketing miners were held
back by the police.
Can mere words constitute an assault?

In MeadeÕ s case (1823), it was ‘declared that no words or singing constituted
an assault,’ but that was said obiter dicta. Fleming argues that the
highwayman’s words ‘stand and deliver’ would constitute an assault.
In the criminal case of R v Ireland (1997), the House of Lords held that
words which instil a reasonable fear of battery amount to assault.
It is clear from Read v Coker (1753) that threatening words combined
with threatening actions is sufficient to constitute an assault.
Words can also negative what would otherwise be an assault. In
Tuberville v Savage (1669), the defendant did not commit an assault by
placing his hand on his sword in the plaintiff’s presence because he said
the words ‘if this was not assize time, I would not take such language
from you’. The words spoken had contradicted the defendant’s actions.
Must the defendant intend to commit a battery?

Assault used to be thought of as an incomplete form of battery. Therefore,
the question arose, if the defendant did not intend to commit battery
but nevertheless induced a belief in the plaintiff’s mind that he was
about to do so would this constitute an assault?
The usual example given is where the defendant points an unloaded
gun at the plaintiff. There are conflicting cases on the point but the general
consensus of opinion appears to be that it is assault. R v St George (1840)
(a criminal case) holds that it is an assault, while Blake v Barnard (1840)
(a civil case) holds that it is not.
It has been said that the analogy between assault and battery cannot
be overstated. It has already been shown that battery can take place
without prior apprehension of harm by the plaintiff (for example, where
he is struck from behind) so there is no reason why assault should
necessarily be incomplete battery.

84

INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH THE PERSON

Act of assault must be intentional

As with battery, the act constituting an assault must be committed
intentionally. If negligently done and harm results, the appropriate cause
of action is in negligence.
Note

Assault and battery are crimes as well as torts and the Offences Against
the Person Act 1861 makes criminal proceedings in certain circumstances
a bar to any subsequent civil proceedings, thereby providing against
duality of actions. Criminal proceedings can provide an alternative form
of compensation, since the court can order the offender to compensate
the victim for any personal injury, loss or damage.
Ex gratia payments of compensation may also be made by the Criminal
Injuries Compensation Board to victims of crimes.
False imprisonment
This is the infliction of bodily restraint which is not expressly or impliedly
authorised by law. Imprisonment in the sense of incarceration is not
necessary nor is any use of force. So, a person can be lawfully imprisoned
in an open field provided his movement is restrained.
The restraint must be complete

If the plaintiff could have left by another route, then the restraint is not
complete. In Bird v Jones (1845), the plaintiff insisted on his right to use
part of the highway that had been cordoned off but he was prevented
from doing so by the defendant. He was told he could go back the way
he had come but could not go straight on. This was not false imprisonment
as it was not a total restraint of liberty. Therefore, wherever there is a
means of escape, provided that it is reasonable to use it, there will be no
false imprisonment. What is a reasonable escape route will depend on
the facts of the case.
An occupier of premises is entitled to impose reasonable conditions
on the manner in which entrants leave the premises. In Robinson v Balmain
Ferry Co Ltd (1910), the defendants operated a ferry with turnstiles for
payment of the fare on one side of the river. Notices stipulated that a
penny must be paid on entering and leaving the wharf. The plaintiff
paid to enter but changed his mind about taking the ferry. He then
refused to pay another penny to exit the wharf and the defendants
prevented him from leaving. This was not false imprisonment. The
plaintiff had contracted to leave the wharf by the ferry and the payment
of a penny was a reasonable condition on his leaving by another route.

85

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Although the Robinson case is not authority for the proposition that
there is a general right to detain people to enforce contractual rights, it
is clear that it is reasonable in some circumstances to impose conditions
as to the point (both in time and in place) of exit, particularly where the
plaintiff has by his conduct consented to a state of affairs, for example,
a passenger on a plane or train, cannot demand to be let off at an
unscheduled stop, or while in motion.
In Herd v Weardale Steel Coal and Coke Co (1915), the plaintiffs were
miners who refused to complete their shift because they considered the
work to be dangerous. The defendants’ manager refused for some time
to allow the lift to be used to take the men up to the lift shaft. The
defendants were not in breach of contract because there was no obligation
to remove the men except at certain times.
It was held that there was no false imprisonment because the men
had voluntarily descended to the mine on the basis that they would be
brought to the surface at the end of the shift. They had therefore consented
to the action. Also, the defendants had committed no positive act of
detention.
This decision tends to indicate that there is no right of action in trespass
for a mere omission, although it has been argued that a failure to release
miners at the contractually agreed time would have amounted to
imprisonment and that liability can be established on the basis of omission.
It has also been argued that Robinson and Herd are not examples of
reasonable contractual conditions preventing false imprisonment but
instead the plaintiffs had consented to their imprisonment, thereby
providing the defendant with a defence.
Must the defendant be aware that he is being falsely imprisoned?

For years, there was conflicting authority on this point. In Herring v Boyle
(1834), a headmaster refused to allow a mother to take her son home for
the school holidays because she had not paid the fees for the term. It
was held that false imprisonment had not been committed as the boy
had been unaware that he had been falsely imprisoned.
By contrast, in the case of Meering v Grahame-White Aviation Co (1919),
the plaintiff was questioned at the defendant’s factory in connection with
certain thefts. The plaintiff was unaware that outside the room in which
he was being questioned two security men were positioned and would
have prevented him from leaving, if necessary.
He succeeded in an action for false imprisonment. Atkin LJ said
imprisonment may damage a person’s reputation even if he did not
know about it. It was somewhat unsatisfactory as an authority as it did

86

INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH THE PERSON

not consider Herring v Boyle and for that reason can be considered per
incuriam.
More recently, in Murray v Ministry of Defence (1988), the House of
Lords approved Atkin LJ’s speech in Meering. The plaintiff’s lack of
knowledge was not relevant to the cause of action but to recoverability
of damages. If the plaintiff was unaware that he had been falsely imprisoned
and had suffered no harm, he could expect to recover nominal damages.
Residual liberty

The House of Lords has held that a prisoner who is lawfully detained
in prison pursuant to s 12 of the Prison Act 1952 does not enjoy any
‘residual liberty’ (Hague v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, Weldon v
Home Office (1991)). So, segregating a prisoner or placing him in a strip
cell does not deprive him of liberty which he has not already lost. A
prisoner can sue in respect of acts committed against him by fellow
prisoners or prison officers acting outside the scope of their authority
as those acts fall outside s 12. Alternatively, if a prisoner is held in
intolerable conditions he may have a cause of action in negligence.
Excess detention

In the case of Olotu v Home Office (1996), the plaintiff was committed for
trial to the Crown Court. There was a time limit of 112 days specified in
the warrant and she was kept in prison for 81 days in excess of this limit.
She sued the Home Office for false imprisonment, arguing that the
governor of the prison should have released her after the expiry of 112
days or obtained a further court order. It was held that the governor of
the prison did not have the authority to release her without an order
from the Crown Court and did not have an independent role in applying
for such an order. Although she should have been released on bail, that
could only be done by an order of the court. Consequently, the Home
Office was not liable. A further attempt to sue the Crown Prosecution
Service for beach of statutory duty for failing to bring the plaintiff before
the court before the expiry of the time limit also failed (see Chapter 4).
The decision in Olotu now looks doubtful following the House of
Lords’ decision in R v Governor of Brockhill Prison ex p Evans (No 2) (2000).
A prison governor was held to be liable for a prisoner’s detention for a
longer period than she should have been detained, even though there
was no fault on the governor’s part and, in calculating the prisoner’s
date of release, he had acted in accordance with Home Office instructions
and complied with the law as it stood at that time. The tort of false
imprisonment is a tort of strict liability.

87

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

The restraint must be intentional

This is a reflection of the views expressed in Letang v Cooper. The tort
must also be committed directly. These are requirements of trespass to
the person.
If, for either reason, the plaintiff cannot establish false imprisonment,
an action in negligence may still be available.
In Sayers v Harlow UDC (1958), the plaintiff became stuck in the
defendant’s toilet, as a result of faulty maintenance of the door lock by
the defendant’s servants. In trying to climb out of the toilet, she fell and
injured herself. The plaintiff succeeded in negligence but would not
have succeeded in false imprisonment because there was no direct act
of imprisonment.
Damages

In Thompson v Metropolitan Police Commissioner (1998), the Court of Appeal
issued guidelines on the criteria that should be taken into account in
determining awards of damages for false imprisonment and malicious
prosecution, which are awarded by juries. Although actual damage does
not have to be proved, except in exceptional cases, damages are to
compensate the plaintiff for injury suffered rather than to punish the
wrongdoer.
Damages for loss of liberty start at about £500 for the first hour of
detention, but thereafter are calculated on a reducing scale to approximately
£3,000 for one day’s imprisonment and a reducing scale for subsequent
days.
Aggravated damages are awarded on evidence of humiliating
circumstances surrounding the detention, or malicious or oppressive
conduct on the part of police officers. Aggravated damages would not
normally be less than £1,000 but would not be double the basic award.
Exemplary damages are awarded in exceptional cases, where there
as been an abuse of power by oppressive or arbitrary conduct.
Defences to trespass to the person
Once the defendant has proved the direct interference that constitutes
trespass, it is for the defendant then to justify his action by reference to
one of the defences.
Discipline

The exercise of disciplinary powers remains a defence to an action in
tort only in relation to children and in the bizarre case of passengers on

INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH THE PERSON

Apart from cases where injuries inflicted before birth are concerned,
children are not prevented from suing their parents even while they
remain minors. It is presumed, however, that parents can justify an
assault and battery by way of lawful chastisement and correction provided
reasonable force is used. Parents can also justify detention of their children
when circumstances are justified. In A v UK (1998), a nine year old boy
was beaten with a garden cane by his stepfather. The stepfather was
acquitted of a charge of assault causing actual bodily harm, as the defence
of reasonable chastisement was available. This was found by the European
Court of Human Rights to be a breach of Art 3 of the European Convention
on Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman or degrading treatment. In
January 2000, the UK Government issued a consultation paper with a
view to implementing the judgment into national legislation but it is
clear that parents’ right to reasonable chastisement is to be curtailed.
Corporal punishment in all schools is prohibited under the School
Standards and Framework Act 1998.
The captain of a ship can use reasonable force against anyone who
threatens the safety of a ship and it is thought that this defence would
apply to the captain of an aeroplane and possibly road and rail transport,
as well.
Lawful arrest, search and seizure

Lawful arrest, search and seizure may constitute a defence to false
imprisonment, battery or interference with goods.
Arrest with warrant

A policeman who arrests a person under a warrant acts lawfully and
commits no trespass.
Arrest without warrant

Section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984 provides
for a category of ‘arrestable offences’, which under s 24(1)–(3) are defined,
as follows:
• offence for which the sentence is fixed by law;
• offence punishable with five years’ imprisonment or more;
• offences specified in s 24(2) and attempting, conspiring, inciting,
aiding, abetting, counselling, or procuring the commission of any of
these offences listed in s 24(2).

89

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Under s 24(5), any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is
guilty or whom he has reasonable grounds to suspect to be guilty of the
offence. This only applies where an arrestable offence has been committed.
Where no offence has actually been committed, a private individual is
not protected from civil liability but, under s 24(6), a police officer will
be protected provided he had reasonable grounds for the arrest.
Section 24(7) enables a police officer to arrest without warrant anyone
who is, or he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be, about to
commit an arrestable offence.
Under s 25, a police officer, in addition to the powers set out in s 24
may effect a lawful arrest where the ‘general arrest conditions’ set out
in s 25 are satisfied:
• where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that any
non arrestable offence is being, or has been, committed or attempted
and it appears to him that service of summons is impracticable and
any of the general arrest conditions are satisfied;
• name and address are unknown or believed to be unreliable;
• arrest is necessary to prevent physical injury, damage to property,
offence against public decency or obstruction of the highway;
• constable has reasonable grounds for believing that arrest is necessary
to protect a child or other person.
The manner of arrest

Section 28 of the PACE 1984 stipulates the basic rules governing the
manner of a lawful arrest. An arrested person must be told as soon as
practicable both that he is under arrest and what the grounds of arrest
are. Section 28 largely enacts the common law rules delivered in the
judgment in Christie v Leachinsky (1947).
Private citizens effecting an arrest must, as soon as is reasonable, hand
the arrested person over to the police. They cannot detain suspects on
their own premises or embark upon their own investigations. This does
not mean that the police must be summoned immediately as can be seen
from the case of John Lewis & Co Ltd v Timms (1952) when the plaintiff
was arrested by the defendant’s store detectives. She was held for some
20 to 60 minutes while the manager decided whether or not to call the
police. This delay was held to be reasonable in the circumstances.
Section 30(1) of the PACE 1984 provides that a constable arresting a
person must take him as soon as is practicable to the police station.

INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH THE PERSON

Necessity

One may lawfully protect one’s person and property and that of another
against the threat of harm even though the consequence is that an innocent
person suffers loss.
In Leigh v Gladstone (1909), a suffragette prisoner who was fasting to
death was forcibly fed through the mouth and nose by prison officers;
she sued them for battery. It was held that it was a good defence that
forcible feeding had saved her life. Recent cases have made it clear that
outside prison, medical patients can refuse treatment, even if that results
in their risking death but the situation with regard to prisoners is unclear.
In F v West Berkshire AHA (1989), the House of Lords relied on the
defence of necessity as justifying sterilisation of a 36 year old woman who
was a voluntary patient in a mental hospital and had the mental age of
five and was therefore under a permanent incapacity. The House of Lords
preferred to rely on necessity rather than rely on an implied form of consent
and was prepared to allow all treatment that was given in the ‘best interests’
of the patient and would be endorsed by a reasonable body of medical
opinion. This is criticised by Jones in Textbook on Torts (4th edn) as it gives
the medical profession wide powers to determine the extent of the defence.
Doctors should seek a declaration from the court before giving treatment
but such a declaration is not mandatory for adult patients (Lord Griffiths
dissenting).
The case highlighted a gap in the law in relation to mental patients.
The Mental Health Act 1983 dispenses with the need to obtain consent
with respect to psychiatric treatment for patients formally detained in
a mental hospital but it does not enable anyone to give consent to treatment
for someone under a mental incapacity who is a voluntary patient or
for physical treatment for detained patients. The Law Commission is
currently reviewing this area.
It was also said that the defence of necessity would authorise medical
treatment to a patient who is temporarily unconscious and unable to
give consent in order to save the patient’s life and prevent permanent
damage to health. Lord Brandon said that not only would it be lawful
for doctors to intervene in this way but it would also be their ‘common
law duty to do so’.
Consent

Conduct which would otherwise constitute trespass to the person may
be rendered not actionable because of express or implied consent.

91

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Sport

Participants in a sport where physical contact is part and parcel of the
game impliedly consent to contacts that occur within the rules of the
game and even certain forms of contact that are not permitted under
the rules. A sportsman does not consent to force which could not reasonably
be expected to happen in the course of the game.
In R v Billinghurst (1978), there was a deliberate punch at a player
who did not have the ball and this constituted a battery. Similarly, in
McNamara v Duncan (1979), a deliberate contact with a player who does
not have the ball in football, constitutes a battery.
Consent to medical treatment

Any physical contact with a patient by a doctor without his patient’s
consent constitutes prima facie a battery. However, the patient’s consent
need not be in writing and will often be inferred/implied from conduct.
Before surgery, patients tend to be asked to sign a consent form which
declares the ‘effect and nature’ of the treatment have been explained. In
order for the consent to be effective, the doctor must have advised the
patient in broad terms of the procedure. A failure to warn the patient of
the risks or side effects of treatment will not vitiate the consent, where
this happens the appropriate form in action is in negligence against the
doctor for breach of his duty to give proper and skilled advice (Sidaway
v Bethlem Royal Hospital Govrs (1985)).
A conscious and competent adult can do what he likes with his own
body and is able to refuse medical treatment. Therefore, in Malette v
Shulman (1991), a doctor who gave a blood transfusion to a Jehovah’s
witness committed a battery.
However, if someone exercising authority over the plaintiff has
exercised undue influence, then this will invalidate the refusal. In Re T
(1992), the patient who needed a blood transfusion but had been persuaded
by her mother, a Jehovah’s witness, to refuse such treatment when in a
weakened condition, had not validly given refusal.
Recently, the Court of Appeal has held in Re MB (1997) that, where a
woman has capacity, she has the right to refuse a caesarean section, even
if it means the death of the baby. An irrational decision does not amount
to incompetence. The test is whether there is ‘some impairment or
disturbance of mental dysfunctioning’ rendering the woman incapable
of making a decision. On the facts of the case, a fear of the anaesthetist’s
needle made the woman incompetent to decide for herself.
Minors

Section 8(1) of the Family Law Reform Act 1969 stipulates that a minor
over 16 may effectively consent to surgical, medical or dental treatment.

92

INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH THE PERSON

Where a child is under 16, the common law provides that where the
individual is mature enough to make up his own decision on the treatment
proposed, the child can give effective consent.
In Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech AHA (1986), the plaintiff failed
in her action to ensure that the contraceptive pill could not be prescribed
to her daughter without her consent. The House of Lords held that a
doctor when faced with a request for the pill or an abortion from a young
girl should first urge the child to discuss the matter with her parents. If
this fails, then he may lawfully prescribe it provided he is satisfied that
the girl has sufficient understanding of the treatment and its implications.
Where a child is too young to give consent, then parental consent to
treatment will be effective.
It was held in Re T (A Minor) (1996) that, where a parent refuses consent
to life-saving invasive surgery, the paramount consideration in deciding
whether leave should be granted was the welfare of the child. Although
there was a ‘very strong presumption in favour of a course of action that
will prolong life’, prolonging life is not the sole objective of the court
and to require it at the expense of other considerations may not be in
the child’s best interests. On the facts of the case, leave was not granted.
The mother was opposed to the surgery and consequently it was not in
the child’s best interest to force the mother to cope with the consequences
of major surgery.
Defence of person or property

A person may use reasonable force to protect his person or property
from attack. The defendant must prove:
• that it was reasonable in the circumstances to defend himself; and
• that the force used by him was reasonable.
So, in Cockcroft v Smith (1705), the clerk of the court sued an attorney for
biting off his forefinger in a scuffle. It was no defence that the plaintiff
had first run his fingers towards the defendant’s eyes. For, in the words
of Holt CJ, a man must not ‘in case of a small assault, give a violent or
unreasonable return’.
It is also possible to defend those with whom one is in a close relationship
such as spouse, child and employer. A distinction used to be made
between these classes of people and the defending of a stranger for which
there was no defence. However, these distinctions are now thought to
be obsolete and that it is now possible to defend anyone from unlawful
force providing reasonable force is used.

93

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

It is also possible to use reasonable force to prevent a trespass onto
land or to eject a trespasser. This right only extends to the occupier or
the occupier’s agent. The trespasser must first be asked to leave and a
reasonable opportunity given for him to do so. The force must be no
more than is necessary to ensure that the trespasser leaves the land.
In Revill v Newbery (1995), a case decided in negligence, it was held
that the defendant had used greater force than was justified in selfdefence when he fired a shotgun through a hole in a door and hit a
trespasser.
Statutory authority

Statutes may authorise the defendant to commit what would otherwise
be a tort. For example, blood tests under ss 20–23 of the Family Law
Reform Act 1969 would constitute a battery in the absence of statutory
authority.
Contributory negligence

Contributory negligence is a defence to trespass to the person.

Intentional physical harm other than trespass
A wilful act (or statement) of the defendant calculated to cause harm to
the plaintiff and in fact causing him harm is a tort.
The rule originated in Bird v Holbrook (1828) which established liability
for intentionally causing harm which has been inflicted indirectly. It
cannot be considered trespass as the harm arises indirectly. For all practical
purposes, it is classified alongside trespass to the person in textbooks.
The principle was applied in the case of Wilkinson v Downton (1897).
The defendant, as a joke, told the plaintiff that her husband had been
involved in an accident and that she was to take two pillows and a cab
to the scene of the accident, to take him home. The plaintiff suffered
severe nervous shock as a result. The defendant was liable for this
behaviour that was intended to cause harm.
A similar case was that of Janvier v Sweeny (1919) where the plaintiff
received damages from the defendants when they told her a false story
that she was wanted by the police for correspondence with a German
spy.
The rule in Wilkinson v Downton remained dormant until the last few
years and is now enjoying something of a revival. It has been used to
plug a gap in domestic violence law. In Khorasandjian v Bush (1993), the

94

INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH THE PERSON

plaintiff was granted an injunction against her former boyfriend in
respect of harassing telephone calls at home and harassment at work
and in the street.
The action succeeded in private nuisance but this part of the judgment
was overruled by the House of Lords in Hunter v Canary Wharf (1997),
as the plaintiff lacked a proprietary interest in the land affected by the
nuisance. However, Lord Hoffman said that did not mean Khorasandjian
was wrongly decided but that it was a case of intentional harassment
and not nuisance.
Khorasandjian followed Burnett v George (1992), which held that a
plaintiff who has suffered abuse that endangers health would succeed
under Wilkinson v Downton.
Harassing behaviour was also found to be tortious by the Court of
Appeal in Burris v Azadani (1995). The defendant had made pestering
telephone calls to the plaintiff and issued threats to harm her.
As a result of mounting public concern over harassment, the Protection
from Harassment Act 1997 was passed. This creates civil remedies and
criminal offences in respect of ‘a course of conduct which amounts to
harassment’, which the defendant ‘knows or ought to know amounts
to harassment’. Conduct will be regarded as harassing if a reasonable
person in possession of the same information thought that it was harassing.

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Private nuisance
The relationship between private nuisance and public
nuisance
There tends to be confusion between public and private nuisance. Public
nuisance is a crime covering a number of interferences with rights of
the public at large, such as brothel keeping, selling impure food and
obstructing public highways. It is not tortious unless an individual
proves that he has suffered particular damage beyond that suffered by
the rest of the community.
Private nuisance is an unlawful interference with the use or enjoyment
of land or some right over, or in connection with it. At one time, the law
of private nuisance seemed to be moving away from solely restraining
activities which affected enjoyment of land. In Khorasandjian v Bush
(1993), the plaintiff was granted an injunction not only in respect of
harassing telephone calls at home but also harassment at work and in
the street.
The House of Lords in Hunter v Canary Wharf (1997) rejected this
approach and confined nuisance to its traditional boundaries. Lord
Hoffman emphasised, in that case, that it is a tort relating to land.
However, private nuisance has been held to extend to damage to a
floating barge moored in a river (Crown River Cruises Ltd v Kimbolton
Fireworks Ltd (1996)). Since the barge was in use as a mooring, it was so
attached for the purpose of the better use and enjoyment of the plaintiffs’
mooring right and therefore sufficient to sustain an action for private
nuisance.
Public nuisance is different from private nuisance as it is not necessarily
connected with the user of land. Public nuisance is usually a crime
although it can be a tort. To make matters even more confusing, the same
incident can be both a public and a private nuisance.
Types of private nuisance

Private nuisance is an unlawful interference with the use or enjoyment
of land, or some right over or in connection with it. What is unlawful
falls to be decided in an ex post facto manner. Most activities which give
rise to claims in nuisance are in themselves lawful. It is only when the
activity interferes with another’s enjoyment of land to an extent that it
is a nuisance that it becomes unlawful.

98

TORTS RELATING TO LAND

Examples of private nuisance

It was said by Lord Wright that ‘the forms that nuisance take are protean’.
Examples would be as follows:
• encroachment on the plaintiff’s land (Davey v Harrow Corporation
(1958));
• physical damage to the plaintiff’s land (Sedleigh-Denfield v OÕCallaghan
(1940));
• interference with the plaintiff’s use or enjoyment of land through
smells, smoke, dust, noise, etc (Halsey v Esso Petroleum Co Ltd (1961));
• interference with an easement or profit.
Physical damage

As a general rule, nuisance is not actionable per se and actual damage
must be proved, subject to the following exceptions:
• where a presumption of damage can be made, for example, where a
building is erected so that one of the cornices projects over the land
of the plaintiff, it may be presumed that damage will be caused to
the land of the plaintiff by rain water dripping from the cornice onto
the land;
• interference with an easement;
• profit ˆ pr endre; or
• right of access where there has been acquiescence in certain circumstances.
So, private nuisance is concerned with balancing the competing claims
of neighbours to use their property as they think fit. However, a distinction
must be made between physical damage to property, where such conduct
will, subject to the de minimis rule, be a nuisance and personal discomfort
or amenity damage, where the judge will consider many factors to
determine the balance.
If the conduct complained of causes physical damage to the plaintiff’s
property, this will amount to nuisance (subject to any defence available).
In St Helens Smelting Co v Tipping (1865), Lord Westbury said an ‘occupier
is entitled to expect protection from physical damage no matter where
he lives’.
Amenity damage

Amenity damage is interference such as noise, smells, dust and vibrations
which will interfere with use and enjoyment of land without physically
damaging the property.

99

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

In the case of amenity damage, the degree of interference has to be
measured against the surrounding circumstances. These factors are as
follows:
Nature of the locality

This is an important determinant of what constitutes nuisance in the
case of amenity damage. As was said in St Helens Smelting Co v Tipping
(1865) ‘one should not expect the clean air of the Lake District in an
industrial town such as St Helens’. The plaintiff’s estate was located in
a manufacturing area. Fumes from a copper smelting works damaged
the trees on the estate. The distinction was made between physical and
damage and amenity damage, particularly the nature of the surrounding
area and locality.
Interesting questions of locality were raised in Halsey v Esso Petroleum
Co (1961). The plaintiff’s house was in a zone that was classified as
residential for planning purposes. The defendant’s oil depot was across
the road in an industrial zone.
There was a combination of physical and amenity damage:
• acid smuts from the defendant’s depot damaged paintwork on the
plaintiff’s car, clothing and washing on the line and there was a
nauseating smell;
• noise from the boilers caused the plaintiff’s windows and doors to
vibrate and prevented him from sleeping and there was also noise
from the delivery tankers at night.
The damage to the clothing on washing line etc constituted physical
damage and was recoverable. Before allowing recovery for the intangible
damage, the locality had to be taken into account. Trifling inconveniences
were disregarded but the locality set the measure of what was acceptable
and the interference substantially exceeded the standards of the surrounding
neighbourhood.
In Laws v Florinplace Ltd (1981), the defendants opened a sex centre
and cinema club which showed explicit sex acts. Local residents sought
an injunction. It was held that the use constituted a private nuisance.
Similarly, in Thompson-Schwab v Costaki (1956), the plaintiff lived in a
respectable residential street in the West End of London. The defendant
used a house in the same street for the purposes of prostitution. It was
held that having regard to the character of the neighbourhood the
defendant’s use of the property constituted a nuisance.
However, the character of a neighbourhood can change over the years,
and a more modern approach is for the court to ask whether the acts

100

TORTS RELATING TO LAND

complained of are more than can be tolerated in modern living conditions.
If so, they will constitute a nuisance: Blackburn v ARC Ltd (1998).
In the public nuisance case of Gillingham BC v Medway (Chatam) Dock
Co (1993), it was held that the nature of a locality can be changed through
planning permission.
In Wheeler v Saunders (1995), it was held that a local authority had no
jurisdiction to authorise a nuisance save in so far as it had the power to
permit a change in the character of the neighbourhood and the nuisance
resulted inevitably from the change of use.
In Murdoch v Glacier Metal Co Ltd (1998), excess noise from a nearby
factory above World Health Organisation levels was not actionable
nuisance. Allowance had to be made for the character of the neighbourhood
which was next to a busy by-pass.
Abnormal sensitivity

Personal discomfort is not to be judged by the standards of the plaintiff
but must be made by reference to the standards of any ordinary person
who might occupy the plaintiff’s property. It must be an ‘inconvenience
materially interfering with the ordinary comfort physically of human
existence, not merely according to elegant and dainty modes and habits
of living but according to plain and sober and simple notions among
the English people’, per Knight Bruce VC in Walter v Selfe (1851).
Consequently, a vicar who was put off his sermons in Heath v Mayor
of Brighton (1908) by a low hum from the defendant’s electricity works
was being abnormally sensitive, particularly as he had been the only
person annoyed and it had not stopped anyone from attending church.
Abnormal sensitivity and physical damage

In the same way, a defendant will not be liable for physical damage to
property caused because of its exceptionally delicate nature. A man
cannot increase the liabilities of his neighbour by applying his own
property to special uses.
In Robinson v Kilvert (1889), the plaintiff occupied a basement in the
ground floor of the defendant’s building and stored brown paper there.
The defendant’s boiler had an adverse effect on the plaintiff’s goods,
although it would not have effected any other type of paper. The plaintiff
failed to get an injunction because of the exceptionally delicate trade
that he was carrying on.
Interference with television signals

In Bridlington Relay Ltd v Yorks Electricity Board (1965), the plaintiffs were
in the business of relaying sound and television broadcasts and the

101

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

defendant’s power lines interfered with their transmissions. It was held
that the plaintiffs were carrying on an exceptionally delicate trade.
For some time, it was thought that Bridlington Relay Ltd would be
decided differently, if it was decided today, as television ownership has
become much more widespread.
However, in Hunter v Canary Wharf (1997), when the presence of the
Canary Wharf tower interfered with the plaintiffs’ television reception,
the House of Lords held that they could not succeed in private nuisance.
It was not ruled out that interference with television could never be
actionable nuisance but, at present, it seems unlikely.
Substantial interference

On the other hand, if the defendant’s activities would have interfered
with the ordinary use of the land, he will be liable notwithstanding the
plaintiff’s abnormal sensitivity. In McKinnon Industries Ltd v Walker (1951),
the Privy Council held that once substantial interference is proved, the
remedies for interference will extend to a sensitive and delicate operation.
Duration of interference

Interference of a temporary or occasional nature, may cause annoyance,
but an injunction will rarely be granted. The temporary duration of the
alleged nuisance is one factor to be taken into account and the judge
will conclude that it is the price of social existence that neighbours suffer
temporary annoyance at various times, such as during building or
renovation.
The defendant in Swaine v GN Railway (1864) dumped refuse next to
the plaintiff’s property before moving it onto another property. The
plaintiff’s claim in nuisance failed as it was temporary and occasional.
Grave temporary interference

The courts will allow actions for temporary nuisance where the interference
is grave. So, in Matania v National Provincial Bank (1936), the plaintiff
succeeded when a temporary nuisance, in the form of building works
carried on by the defendant’s independent contractors, prevented the
plaintiff from carrying on his livelihood, as a music teacher.
Similarly, in De KeyserÕ s Royal Hotel v Spicer Bros (1914), use of a steam
pile driving machine outside the plaintiff’s hotel causing hotel guests
to lose a night’s sleep and the prevention of after dinner speakers from
making themselves heard also constituted nuisance.
Contrast the De KeyserÕ s Royal Hotel case with Murdoch v Glacier Metal
Co Ltd (1998) where excess noise from a nearby factory, which exceeded
World Health Organisation levels, was held not to be actionable nuisance.
The property was in a noisy neighbourhood.

102

TORTS RELATING TO LAND

Single act of the defendant

Nuisance is usually associated with a continuing state of affairs rather
than a single act of the defendant. It was held in British Celanese Ltd v
AH Hunt (Capacitors) Ltd (1969) that an isolated occurrence could constitute
nuisance.
In SCM (UK) Ltd v WJ Whittall & Son Ltd (1970), it was said that for a
single escape to constitute nuisance, the nuisance had to arise from the
condition of the defendant’s land. It should be remembered that a single
occurrence could constitute a right of action under the rule in Rylands v
Fletcher.
Malice

Motive is generally irrelevant in tort, as can be seen from Bradford
Corporation v Pickles (1895), where a bad motive on its own did not create
a right of action. This rule needs qualification in the case of private
nuisance, as malice may tip the scales in the defendant’s favour, and
conduct which would not otherwise be actionable becomes unlawful
and a nuisance if it has been committed maliciously. In Christie v Davey
(1893), the defendant lived next door to a music teacher. He objected to
the noise and retaliated with banging on the walls, beating trays, etc.
The plaintiff was granted an injunction but the outcome would have
been different if the acts had been innocent.
In Hollywood Silver Fox Farm Ltd v Emmett (1936), the plaintiffs bred
silver foxes. If they are disturbed in the breeding season, they eat their
young. The defendant fired a gun as near as possible to the breeding
pens with the malicious intention of causing damage. The defendant
was held liable, although the decision has been criticised on the grounds
that breeding silver foxes was an exceptionally delicate trade. It seems
that the element of malice was sufficient to alter the outcome.
Public benefit

It is not a defence in nuisance to say that the activity is being carried on
in the public benefit (Adams v Ursell (1913)). Nevertheless, if the activity
is being carried out for the good of the community in general, then the
courts are more likely to find the use of the land to be reasonable.
Defendant’s negligence

The fact that a defendant has acted with all reasonable care does not
necessarily mean that the use of the land was reasonable. On the other
hand, want of reasonable care may be strong evidence of a nuisance. It
is not reasonable to expect a plaintiff to endure discomfort that the
defendant could have avoided with reasonable care.

103

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Lord Reid in The Wagon Mound (No 2) (1967) said that:
... negligence in the narrow sense may not be necessary, but fault of
some kind is almost always necessary, and generally involves
foreseeability.

As nuisance is a tort which relates to user of land, fault in nuisance is
thought to relate to unreasonable use of land. This makes fault in nuisance
an altogether more subjective concept than in negligence. Nuisance does
not use the same concepts for assessing fault as negligence. For example,
it does not require the existence of a duty of care before establishing the
existence of fault but confusingly, judges have used the terminology of
negligence when discussing nuisance. Nuisance protects a wider range
of interests than negligence. The latter is mainly concerned with physical
interests whereas the former protects against noise, smells, dust, etc,
and will compensate for pure commercial losses (Campbell v Paddington
BC (1911)).
Nuisance is also distinct from negligence in terms of who has locus
standi to bring an action and the remedies available.
Liability has been imposed in public nuisance in the absence of fault
(Tarry v Ashton, Wringe v Cohen).
Who can sue?

Nuisance protects those persons who have an interest in the land affected,
so only an owner or occupier can sue.
In Malone v Laskey (1907), the wife of a licensee whose enjoyment of
the land was interfered with could not sue in nuisance, as she did not
have a proprietary interest.
Although the plaintiff in Khorasandjian v Bush (1993) was able to sue
without a proprietary interest in the land, the House of Lords overruled
this part of the case in Hunter v Canary Wharf (1997). The House of Lords
held that the plaintiff should establish a right to the land affected in
order to sue in private nuisance. This restricts nuisance as a tort designed
to protect interests in land.
In Delaware Mansions Ltd v Westminster CC (1999), the owner could
sue even though the damage occurred before the owner had acquired
the freehold to the property. The claimant was the owner of a block of
flats damaged by encroaching tree roots. A continuing cause of action
existed, as there was a continuing nuisance.

104

TORTS RELATING TO LAND

Who can be sued?
The creator of the nuisance

A person who creates a nuisance by positive conduct may be sued. It is
not necessary for the creator of the nuisance to have any interest in the
land from which the nuisance emanates.
In the words of Devlin J in Southport Corporation v Esso (1953):
I can see no reason why ... if the defendant as a licensee or trespasser
misuses someone else’s land he should not be liable for a nuisance
in the same way as an adjoining occupier would be.
The occupier

The occupier is the usual defendant in private nuisance. An occupier
will be liable for the following.
Persons under his control

Under the principles of agency and vicarious liability.
Independent contractors

Where nuisance is an inevitable or foreseeable consequence of work
undertaken by independent contractors, the occupier cannot avoid
liability by employing a contractor as has been already seen in the case
of Matania v National Provincial Bank Ltd (1936).

An occupier who knows or ought reasonably to have known of the
existence of a nuisance created by a predecessor in title will be liable for
continuing the nuisance if he does not abate it. If the nuisance could not
reasonably have been discovered, he will not be liable.
It was held in St AnneÕ s Well Brewery Co v Roberts (1929) that if at the
date of a letting, the landlord knows or ought to know of the condition
giving rise to the actionable nuisance, then he is liable during the tenancy
where he does not take from the tenant a covenant to repair.
Actions of trespassers

An occupier is not liable for a nuisance created on his land by a trespasser
unless he adopts or continues the nuisance.
In Sedleigh-Denfield v OÕCallaghan (1940), the boundary between the
appellant’s premises and the respondents’ was a hedge and a ditch, both
of which belonged to the respondents. Without informing the respondents,
a trespasser laid a pipe in the ditch and some three years later the pipe
became blocked and the appellant’s garden was flooded. The respondents’

105

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

servants had cleared the ditch out twice yearly. The appellants claimed
damages in nuisance.
It was held that he would succeed because the respondents knew or
ought to have known of the existence of the nuisance and permitted it
to continue without taking prompt and efficient action to abate it.
Acts of nature

At common law, it was thought that an occupier had no duty to abate
a nuisance that arose on his land from natural causes. The extent of the
obligation was to permit his neighbour access to abate the nuisance. The
Privy Council in Goldman v Hargrave (1967) established that an occupier
is under a duty to do what is reasonable in the circumstances to prevent
or minimise a known risk of damage to the neighbour’s property.
The appellant was the owner/occupier of land next to the respondents.
A tree on the appellant’s land was struck by lightning and caught fire.
The appellants took steps to deal with the burning tree but subsequently
left the fire to burn itself out and took no steps to prevent the fire spreading.
The fire later revived and spread causing extensive damage to the
respondent’s land. The appellants were held to be liable.
In Leakey v National Trust (1980), the defendants owned a hill that was
liable to crack and slip. The plaintiffs owned houses at the foot of the
hill. After a large fall, the plaintiffs asked the defendants to remove the
earth and debris from their land but they refused saying they were not
responsible for what had occurred. The defendants were held liable in
nuisance. It was reasonable to prevent or minimise the known risk of
damage or injury to one’s neighbour or to his property.
In Bradburn v Lindsay (1983), it was held that where houses have
mutual rights of support, negligently allowing property to fall into
dereliction so as to damage the adjoining premises is actionable in
negligence as well as in nuisance.
The landlord

A landlord may be liable for a nuisance arising in three types of situation:
• where the landlord authorised the nuisance.
In Sampson v Hodson-Pressinger (1981), a tiled terrace was built over
the plaintiff’s sitting room and bedroom. The noise was excessive
and it was held that the landlord was liable in nuisance.
A landlord, who lets flats with poor sound insulation to tenants was
not liable in the tort of nuisance to a tenant whose reasonable use and
enjoyment of her flat was interfered with by the ordinary use of an
adjoining flat by another tenant (Baxter v Camden LBC (No 2) (1998)).

106

TORTS RELATING TO LAND

It is arguable that a landowner can be liable for repeated acts constituting
nuisance committed from its land by those it knew were in occupation,
and where no steps were taken to evict them (Lippiatt v South
Gloucestershire CC (1999)).
However, all will depend on the exact circumstances and, in Hussein
v Lancaster CC (1998), the Court of Appeal found that a local authority
was not liable for failing to stop acts of criminal damage by council
tenants where the harassment did not emanate from ‘common parts’
of an estate, such as walkways and avenues;
• where nuisance existed before the date of the letting;
• where the landlord has an obligation or right to repair.
The law on landlords’ liability for nuisance is still developing and there
are conflicting lines of authority which can be confusing – see Southwark
LBC v Mills (1998).
Defences
Prescription

A defendant who has carried on an activity for 20 years may claim a
prescriptive right to commit the nuisance. The activity must be an
actionable nuisance for the entire 20 year period.
In Sturges v Bridgman (1879), a confectioner and a physician lived next
door to each other. The confectioner used two large machines and had
done so for more than 20 years. The noise and vibrations had been no
problem until the physician built a consulting room at the end of his
garden. It was held that the confectioner could not rely on the defence
of prescription as there was no actionable nuisance until the consulting
room had been built.
Statutory authority

If a statute authorises the defendants’ activity, the defendants will not
be liable for interferences which are inevitable and could not have been
avoided by the exercise of reasonable care.
In Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd (1981), a statute authorised the defendants
to carry out oil refinement works. The plaintiff complained of noise,
smell and vibration. It was held that the defendants had a defence of
statutory immunity.

It is not a defence to plead that:
the defendant moved to the nuisance (Sturges v Bridgman; Miller v
Jackson (1977)). Cricket had been played on a village ground since 1905.
In 1970, houses built in such a place that cricket balls went into a
garden. It was held that there was a nuisance that was an interference
with the reasonable enjoyment of land. It was no defence to say the
defendant had brought trouble onto his own head by moving there;
in Baxter v Camden LBC (No 2) (1998), it was held that Sturges v Bridgeman
did not apply where the parties are landlord and tenant. Such cases
were decided on the principle ‘caveat lessee’ and the lessee was bound
to take the premises as he found them;
that there is a substantial public benefit. In Adams v Ursell (1913), the
defendant ran a fish and chip shop. The plaintiff objected to the noise
and smells. The defendant tried to argue that the fish and chip shop
was of public benefit but it was held that this was no defence;
that the nuisance is the result of the separate actions of several people.
In Pride of Derby and Derbyshire Angling Association Ltd v British Celanese
Ltd (1952), pollutant sewage from factories reached a river through
the effluent pipe of a local authority from the sewage works. It was
held that the local authority were responsible.

Remedies
• Damages
Lord Hoffman in Hunter v Canary Wharf (1997) said that damages
should be fixed by reference to the diminution in the capital value of
the property.
• Injunction
An injunction is an equitable, and therefore a discretionary, remedy.
If the injunction is a continuing one, the plaintiff will be granted an
injunction except:
(a) if the injury to the plaintiff’s legal rights is small;
(b) is one capable of being estimated in money;
(c) is one adequately compensated by a small money payment;
(d) is a case where it would be oppressive to the defendants to grant
an injunction.
• Abatement or self-help
Notice should be given except in an emergency or where it is not
necessary to enter the wrongdoer’s land.

108

TORTS RELATING TO LAND

In Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd v British Railways Board (1995), it was
held that the right to abatement was confined to cases where the security
of lives and property required immediate and speedy action or where
such action could be exercised simply without recourse to the expense
and inconvenience of legal proceedings in circumstances unlikely to
give rise to argument or dispute. Where an application to court could
be made, the remedy of self-help was neither appropriate or desirable.

Public nuisance
A public nuisance is a crime as well as a tort. The remedy for a public
nuisance is a prosecution or relator action by the Attorney General on
behalf of the public. A plaintiff who suffers particular damage, over and
above the damage suffered by the rest of the public may maintain an
action in public nuisance. Public nuisance has been defined by Romer LJ
in AG v PYA Quarries Ltd (1957) as ‘an act or omission which materially
affects the reasonable comfort of a class of Her Majesty’s subjects’.
The distinction between public and private nuisance
Public nuisance

• protects land and other interests;
• primarily a crime;
• plaintiff must prove special damage over and above the rest of the
public;
• single act can be enough;
• no defence of prescription;
• exemplary damages are not available;
• strict liability for some forms of highway damage.
Private nuisance

•

essentially protects land;
only a tort;
plaintiff must prove damage;
for single act it is necessary to show it arose from state of affairs;
prescription is a defence;

109

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

• exemplary damages may be available;
• fault must usually be proved subject to exceptions.
Public nuisance is most important in relation to highways
What obstructions are actionable?

A temporary or permanent obstruction that is reasonable in amount and
duration will not be a nuisance.
In R v Russell (1805), the defendant left wagons standing on the street
for several hours at a time for the purpose of loading and unloading
and this was held to be a public nuisance.
In AG v Gastonia Coaches Ltd (1977), overnight parking in the street
of coaches constituted a nuisance.
An obstruction which creates a foreseeable danger will amount to a
nuisance.
In Ware v Garston Haulage Co (1944), an unlit vehicle parked at night
so as to obstruct the highway, may cause a nuisance, although it will
depend on the facts.
In Dymond v Pearce (1972), the defendant parked a lorry overnight
under a lit street lamp without lights. This was regarded as a nuisance
although the plaintiff did not succeed as the nuisance was not the cause
of the plaintiff’s injury. While, in Dollman v Hillman (1941), a piece of fat
on which someone slipped was a nuisance.
Premises adjoining the highway

Tarry v Ashton (1876) is an example of public nuisance being a tort of
strict liability, in certain cases. The defendant’s lamp projected over the
highway. An independent contractor repaired the lamp but it fell on the
plaintiff; the defendant was found liable in the absence of fault.
Similarly, in Wringe v Cohen (1939), a wall to the defendant’s houses
which were let to weekly tenants collapsed but the defendants were
liable to keep the house in a good state of repair. The defendants did not
know that the wall was in a dangerous condition but were nevertheless
held to be liable. In Mint v Good (1951), again, a wall in front of houses
which were let to weekly tenants collapsed although there was no express
agreement between the landlord and tenant as to repair. The landlord
was held to be liable.

110

TORTS RELATING TO LAND

Does the occupier have to be aware of the nuisance?
In the recent case of R v Shorrock (1993), the defendant let a farm on his
field to three persons for a weekend for £2,000. The defendant did not
know the purpose for which the field had been let. The field was used
for an acid house party lasting 15 hours and attended by between 3,000
and 5,000 people who paid £15 per person admission. Many local people
complained about the noise and disturbance caused by the party and
the defendant and the organisers were charged with public nuisance. It
was held that it was not necessary to show that the defendant had actual
knowledge of the nuisance but merely that he knew or ought to have
known the consequences of activities carried out on his land.
The defendant ought to have known that there was a real risk that
the consequences of the licence would create the nuisance that occurred.
Particular damage
The plaintiff must suffer direct and substantial damage to bring an action
in public nuisance.
The following have been held to be special damage:
• additional transport costs, caused by an obstruction (Rose v Miles
(1815));
• obstructing access to a coffee shop (Benjamin v Storr (1874));
• obstructing the view of a procession so that the plaintiff lost profit on
renting a room (Campbell v Paddington BC (1911)).

The rule in Rylands v Fletcher
The rule in Rylands v Fletcher is a rule of strict liability, that is, it does not
require proof of negligence or lack of care, or wrongful intention, on the
part of the defendant. However, actual damage must be proved; it is not
a tort that is actionable per se.
The original statement

The rule was originally formulated by Blackburn J in Rylands v Fletcher
in the following terms ‘the person who for his own purposes brings onto
his land, and collects or keeps there, anything likely to do mischief if it
escapes, must keep it in at his own peril and, if he does not do so, is
prima facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence

111

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

of the escape’. This was approved by the House of Lords and the condition
that there must be a ‘non-natural user’ was added by Lord Cairns.
Limits of the rule
These may be summarised as follows:
• there must have been an escape of something ‘likely to do mischief’;
• there must have been a non-natural use of the land.
There must be an escape
In Read v Lyons & Co Ltd (1947), it was said that escape, for the purposes
of applying the proposition in Rylands v Fletcher, means (per Lord Simon)
‘escape from a place where the defendant has occupation or control over
land to a place which is outside his occupation or control’ and (per Lord
Macmillan) ‘there must be the escape of something from one man’s close
to another man’s close’.
In Read v Lyons, the plaintiff was a munitions worker who was injured
by an exploding shell while in the defendant’s munitions factory. It was
held that there had not been an escape of a dangerous thing, so the
defendant could not be liable under Rylands v Fletcher.
The plaintiff must prove not only that there has been an escape but
that damage is a natural consequence of the escape.
Can a plaintiff sue for personal injuries?
There is some controversy as to what type of damage is recoverable
under Rylands v Fletcher. In Read v Lyons Co Ltd, it was questioned whether
Rylands v Fletcher could be used for personal injuries claims, particularly
by Lord Macmillan. Nevertheless, it is now generally accepted that an
occupier would be able to maintain an action for personal injuries.
In Hale v Jennings (1938), a ‘chair-o-plane’ from a fairground attraction
became detached and landed on the plaintiff’s stall, on an adjoining
ground. A claim for personal injuries was allowed. Such a claim was
also allowed in Miles v Forest Rock Granite Co Ltd (1918).
In Perry v KendrickÕ s Transport (1956), it was said that the plaintiff could
recover for personal injuries even where he had no interest in the land
affected.
However, the rule in Rylands v Fletcher will not extend so far as to
cover situations where a plaintiff has no interest in the land which is

112

TORTS RELATING TO LAND

affected by the escape, and whose only loss is financial (Weller v FMDRI
(1966)).
Does the plaintiff have to be an occupier?
There is a dispute as to whether or not it is necessary to have an interest in
the land in order to maintain an action under the rule in Rylands v Fletcher.
While there are comments in such cases as Read v Lyons and Weller v
FMDRI which seem to suggest that the plaintiff must be an occupier or
have some interest in the land, there are other cases which adopt a
broader view. Lawton J said obiter in British Celanese v Hunt (1969) that
the plaintiff need not be the occupier of adjoining land, or any land.
Furthermore, it was held that to use the premises for manufacturing
was an ordinary use of the land. The issue can only be settled by the
House of Lords. An authoritative decision on this point is required.
Non-natural user
This requirement was added by Lord Cairns in the House of Lords in
Rylands v Fletcher itself. This expression is highly flexible and enables
the court to take into account their own interpretation of contemporaneous
needs. The way the Privy Council expressed the position in Rickards v
Lothian (1913) emphasised the flexibility:
It must be some special use bringing with it increased danger to
others and must not merely be the ordinary use of the land or such
a use as is proper for the general benefit of the community.

There have, however, been decided cases which have maintained that
certain circumstances can confidently be regarded as being outside the
sphere of Rylands v Fletcher because the courts have held that the land
is being naturally used, for example, lighting of a fire in a fire place
(Sochacki v Sas (1947)); storing metal foil strips in a factory (British Celanese
v Hunt (1969)).
In deciding what constitutes a natural use, Lord Porter in Read v Lyons
said:
... each seems to be a question of fact subject to a ruling by the judge
as to whether ... the particular use can be non-natural and in deciding
this question I think that all the circumstances of the time and place
and practice of mankind must be taken into consideration so what
might be regarded as ... non-natural may vary according to the
circumstances.

113

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

For example, storage of motor parts and engines in Mason v Levy Auto
Parts (1967) was not a natural use having regard to the large quantities
of combustible material, manner of storage and character of the
neighbourhood.
Non-natural use is a flexible concept and will vary according to time
and context. For example, in Perry v Kendricks Transport (1956), the Court
of Appeal found itself bound by the decision of Musgrove v Pandelis
(1919) in holding that a full tank of petrol was a non-natural use of the
land. Some commentators maintain that this would not be applied today.
Storage of chemicals for industrial use in large quantities was held
to be a non-natural use in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties
Leather plc (1994).
In Ellison v Ministry of Defence (1997), rainwater which accumulated
naturally on an airfield and not artificially kept there was held to be a
natural use of the land. Consequently, it fell outside the rule in Rylands
v Fletcher.
Brings onto his land and keeps there
The thing may or may not be something which in its nature is capable
of being naturally there. What matters is whether the particular thing
has in fact been accumulated there. Rylands v Fletcher only applies to
things artificially brought or kept upon the defendant’s land.
There is no liability for things naturally on the land, such as the spread
of thistles from ploughed land in Giles v Walker (1890) or rocks falling
from a natural outcrop in Pontardawe RDC v Moore-Gwyn (1929).
More recently, flooding by rainwater was held to be something which
occurred naturally on the land and was not an accumulation in Ellison
v Ministry of Defence (1997).
These cases can be contrasted with Crowhurst v Amersham Burial Board
(1878) where yew trees planted close to railings spread onto an adjoining
meadow on which the plaintiff pastured his horse, which was poisoned
and died as a result of eating yew leaves. The defendant was liable,
although the yew trees were capable of being naturally there, the defendant
had planted the trees and therefore they constituted an accumulation.
Liability in negligence and nuisance

The old common law rule was that an occupier was not under a duty
to abate a nuisance that arises from his land as a result of natural causes.
This was changed by the Privy Council in Goldman v Hargrave (1967)
and was applied by the Court of Appeal in Leakey v National Trust for

114

TORTS RELATING TO LAND

Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty (1980). The remedy for an
escape of something occurring naturally on the land is, therefore, in
nuisance or negligence not under Rylands v Fletcher.
Anything likely to do mischief if it escapes
This is a question of fact in each case. However, things which have been
held to be within the rule include electricity, gas which was likely to
pollute water supplies, explosives, fumes and water.
A very broad view can be taken. In AG v Corke (1933), it was held that
the owner of land who allowed caravan dwellers to live on it was
answerable for the interference they caused on adjoining land, on the
basis that they were ‘things likely to do mischief’.
Defences
Consent of plaintiff

If the plaintiff has permitted the accumulation of the thing which escapes,
then he cannot sue. Implied consent, such as common benefit is also a
defence.
Common benefit

If the accumulation benefits both the plaintiff and the defendant, this is
an important element in deciding whether the plaintiff is deemed to
have consented.
In Carstairs v Taylor (1871), rainwater which had been collected on the
roof of a block of flats for the benefit of several occupants meant that
the landlord was not liable when the water escaped as it had been
accumulated for a common benefit. While, in Peters v Prince of Wales
Theatre (1943), a fire extinguisher which exploded, damaging part of the
building occupied by the plaintiffs, was also held to have been accumulated
for a common benefit.
Blackburn J spoke only of persons who ‘for his own purposes’ brings
something onto his land. Thus, gas, water, electricity boards and inland
waterways authorities carrying out statutory duties do not accumulate
for their own purposes, so Rylands v Fletcher does not apply.
Act of a stranger

It is a defence that the escape was caused by the unforeseeable act of a
stranger over whom the defendant has no control.

115

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

In Rickards v Lothian (1913), someone deliberately blocked a basin in
the defendant’s premises and turned the taps on, flooding the plaintiff’s
premises below. While, in Perry v Kendricks Transport (1956), the plaintiff
was injured by an explosion caused by a boy trespasser who threw a
lighted match into a petrol tank. The Court of Appeal held that the
defendants were not liable as they had no control over trespassers and
had not been negligent.
Foreseeable act of a stranger

The defendant in Hale v Jennings (1938) ought reasonably to have foreseen
the act of a third party and had enough control over the premises to
prevent the escape.
Act of God

If an escape is caused, through natural causes and without human
intervention, in ‘circumstances which no human foresight can provide
against and of which human prudence is not bound to recognise the
possibility’ (Tennent v Earl of Glasgow (1864)), then there is said to be the
defence of Act of God.
In Nichols v Marsland (1876), the defence succeeded where a violent
thunderstorm caused flooding.
The case was put into proper perspective by the House of Lords in
Greenock Corporation v Caledonian Railway Co (1917) where an extraordinary
and unprecedented rainfall was held in similar circumstances not to be
an Act of God. The explanation of Nichols v Marsland (1876) was that
there the jury found that no reasonable person could have anticipated
the storm and the court would not disturb a finding of fact.
Earthquakes and tornadoes may sometimes be Acts of God, but few
other phenomena seem likely to be within the scope of Rylands v Fletcher.
Statutory authority

Sometimes, public bodies storing water, gas, electricity and the like are
by statute exempted from liability so long as they have taken reasonable
care. It is a question of statutory interpretation whether, and, if so, to
what extent, liability under Rylands v Fletcher is excluded.
Liability was excluded in Green v Chelsea Waterworks Co (1894) when,
without negligence on the defendants’ part, their water main exploded
and flooded the plaintiff’s premises.
This can be compared to Charing Cross Elec Co v Hydraulic Power Co
(1914) where the defendants were liable when their hydraulic main burst
even though there was no question of negligence on their part, as the
statute did not exempt them from liability.

116

TORTS RELATING TO LAND

Default of the plaintiff

The defendant is not liable where damage is caused by the plaintiff’s
act or default. If the plaintiff is partially responsible, then the Law Reform
(Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 will apply.
In Ponting v Noakes (1894), the defendant’s colt reached over the
defendant’s land and ate some branches of a yew tree and died. The action
did not succeed as the animal’s death was due to its wrongful intrusion.
Where the damage is attributable to the extra sensitivity of the plaintiff’s
property then there is no liability (Eastern and South African Telegraph Co
Ltd v Cape Town Tramways Co Ltd (1902)).
Remoteness
Blackburn J said that a defendant is prima facie liable for all the damage
which is the natural consequence of the escape.
It was argued that following the decision of the Privy Council in The
Wagon Mound (No 2) (1967) that the test for remoteness of damage is
foreseeability then the test in Rylands v Fletcher is also foreseeability.
It has also been argued that where damage has been caused as a result
of the extraordinary risk created by the defendant then the defendant
should be liable for the unforeseeable risk.
An important development has been the House of Lords’ decision in
Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc (1994). It was held
that foreseeability of damage was an essential prerequisite of liability.
Strict liability arises only if the defendant knows or ought to foresee that
the thing which is stored might cause damage if it escapes. Once there
is such knowledge or foreseeability, the defendant is liable even if he
takes all reasonable care to prevent the escape.
Future of strict liability for hazardous activities
The scope of the rule in Rylands v Fletcher has been cut down considerably
by the requirements that there be a non-natural use of the land.
The defences, particularly act of a stranger and statutory authority,
turn a tort of strict liability into an inquisition on the defendant’s culpability.
The Pearson Commission recommended a statutory scheme of strict
liability for personal injuries resulting from exceptional risks. Under the
scheme, strict liability would be imposed in two circumstances:
• those which by their unusually hazardous activities require close,
careful supervision; and

117

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

• those which, although normally safe, are likely to cause serious and
extensive casualties if they do go wrong.
Contributory negligence and voluntary assumption of the risk would
be general defences, but statutory authority and act of a third party
would not. The fact that the plaintiff was a trespasser would not be a
general defence but could be introduced as a defence to a specific type
of exceptional risk when making the statutory instrument.

Fire
Liability at common law
Liability was originally established for fire in Beaulieu v Finglam (1401).
The writ in that case used the expression tan negligenter ac improvide. The
defendant had ‘kept his fire that it escaped’. ‘Negligence’ means negligence
in its old, not modern, sense. If the defendant started a fire on his land
which spread, he would be liable. The duty imposed on occupiers was
a strict one. The occupier was liable for fires started by his guests, servants
and independent contractors.
The occupier was not liable for fires started by strangers or acts of
God.
Stranger

This was originally limited to trespassers. In Beaulieu v Finglam (1401),
it was said that the occupier was not liable if the fire was caused ‘by a
man outside my household’. This was confirmed in Tuberville v Stamp
(1697) when Holt CJ said that if: ‘A stranger sets fire to my house and
burns my neighbour’s house, no action will lie against me.’
Lord Denning in H and N Emanuel Ltd v Greater London Council (1971)
extended the defence by allowing it to apply to guests in certain
circumstances:
A stranger is anyone who in lighting a fire or allowing it to escape
acts contrary to anything which the occupier of the house could
anticipate that he would do.

Prior to this, it has always been thought that the occupier would be liable
for fires started by guests but according to this dictum an occupier would
not be liable for a fire started by a guest if the guest’s conduct in lighting
the fire was so alien to the invitation then with regard to the fire then
he ought to be regarded as a trespasser.

118

TORTS RELATING TO LAND

Centuries later, other remedies became available for starting a fire
under the rule in Rylands v Fletcher, nuisance and negligence.
Fire Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774

This Act still applies and s 86 provides:
No action, suit or process whatsoever shall be had, maintained or
prosecuted against any person in whose house, chamber, stable, barn
or other building, or on whose estate any fire shall accidentally begin.

This cut down the effect of the common law rule for fire, since the occupier
would no longer be liable for accidental fires. However, in Filliter v
Phippard (1847), it was held that a fire did not start ‘accidentally’ within
the meaning of the Act when it started ‘negligently’. A fire only started
accidentally when it started by ‘mere chance’ or ‘was incapable of being
traced to any cause’.
Also, the Act does not apply where a fire does start accidentally but
is negligently allowed to spread, as in Musgrove v Pandelis (1919), when
a fire started ‘accidentally’ in the defendant’s car. The fire could have
been stopped if the defendant had turned off the tap connecting the
petrol tank with the carburettor. He did not do so and the fire spread to
the plaintiff’s flat causing damage. The defendant was liable as the
spread of the fire was regarded as a second fire which had not started
‘accidentally’.
Immunity under the statute is illustrated by the following cases:
• Collingwood v Home and Colonial Stores Ltd (1936)
A fire broke out because of defective electrical wiring on the defendant’s
premises, without negligence on the defendant’s part.
• Sochacki v Sas (1947)
A fire was properly lit and a spark jumped out of it causing it to
spread.
• Spicer v Smee (1946)
This case is authority for the proposition that fire can be actionable
under nuisance.
Strict liability for fire and Rylands v Fletcher

The rule of strict liability for fire laid down in Beaulieu v Finglam predated
that in Rylands v Fletcher.
In Musgrove v Pandelis, a car kept in a garage attached to a house,
which contains a tank full of petrol was held to be a ‘non-natural’ use

119

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

of the land and also something likely to do ‘mischief’ if it escapes. It was
held that the rule in Rylands v Fletcher applied. Bankes LJ said that the
Fire Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774 was not intended to apply to
Rylands v Fletcher type situations. This was said even despite the fact
that Rylands v Fletcher did not exist at the time of the Act!
The findings in Musgrove v Pandelis have been severely criticised and
doubted. If it is correct, then the rule of strict liability for fire has now
been subsumed into Rylands v Fletcher.
Mackenna J criticised the decision in Mason v Levy Auto Parts of England
Ltd (1967). He said that liability for fire could not be based on the rule
in Rylands v Fletcher. He argued that the car had not escaped from the
land in Musgrove v Pandelis nor had the petrol in the tank. Liability for
fire should have arisen under the old common law principles laid down
in Filliter v Phippard. Rylands v Fletcher was not the same as these principles
but had developed out of them.
The test, Mackenna J said, was that the defendant must have brought
onto the land something likely to catch fire and must have kept the thing
on the land in such conditions that if they did ignite the fire would spread
to the plaintiff’s land and the thing brought onto the land was in the
course of some non-natural use and the thing ignited and spread.
He uses very similar language to that used by Blackburn J in Rylands
v Fletcher but there is a subtle but very real difference.
Under Rylands, the thing itself escapes. Under Mackenna J’s test, the
defendant would have to bring inflammable material onto his land which
then sets alight and spreads to the neighbouring land. This seems a more
logical test since, under Rylands, the defendant would have to bring fire
onto his land and the fire would have to escape. The Mason test says
that the defendant would have to bring something onto his land which
is likely to catch fire and if the fire starts it would spread to neighbouring
land.
Liability under statute
Legislation has been passed with respect to fires started by sparks from
railway engines. Where statute has authorised the use of a railway line
by engines, liability could not be imposed by the railway line owners
for fires caused by sparks from the engine, if the owners had not been
negligent.
In Vaughan v Taff Vale Railway Co (1860), sparks from an engine belonging
to the defendants set fire to a wood owned by the plaintiff. The defendants

120

TORTS RELATING TO LAND

had been authorised by statute to use the railway and had taken every
precaution. The railway company was liable.
This can be contrasted with Jones v Ffestiniog Railway Co (1868), where
the railway owners were liable as they did not have statutory authority.
The rule was thought to be hard on farmers so the Railway Fires Acts
of 1905 and 1923 were passed which created liability for fires caused by
sparks from trains but limited the liability to £200 in respect of damage
to land and crops.

Trespass to land
Trespass to land has been defined by Winfield and Jolowicz as ‘the
unjustifiable interference with the possession of land’. Since it is a form
of trespass, it is actionable per se. The interest it protects is the plaintiff’s
interest in the peaceful enjoyment of his property. It therefore protects
possession not ownership. Consequently, the plaintiff must be in possession
of the land.
Trespass to land will only help the lessor, if there is damage to the
reversion (Jones v Llanrwst UDC (1911)).
Nor will trespass to land protect a licensee such as a lodger or guest
(Hill v Tupper (1863); Allan v Liverpool Overseers (1874)).
The court will look for possession in fact, not possession in law, it is
possible to be temporarily absent from the house, for example, on an
errand.
A lessee is regarded as having possession for the purpose of trespass
(Graham v Peat (1801)).
Nature of the interference
The interference must be direct and immediate. The most common
example would be entering on the plaintiff’s land without permission.
However, the tort is very varied and can be committed in many
different ways. Placing a ladder against a wall can be trespass (Westripp
v Baldock (1938)).
A person who has permission to be on the land can become a trespasser
if they abuse their permission or remain on the land after the permission
has been withdrawn (Robson v Hallett (1967)).
Trespass can be ‘continuing’, when it takes place over a period of
time. When it is continuing it gives rise to a new cause of action from
day to day, as long as the trespass lasts.

121

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Particular forms of trespass
Trespass on the highway

The highway is used for travelling from one point to another. Trespass
will be committed when the highway is used for some purpose which
is not incidental to the purpose of passage.
In Hickman v Maisey (1900), the defendant walked back and forth
along the same stretch of highway studying the form of racehorses which
were practising nearby. This constituted trespass.
In Harrison v Duke of Rutland (1893), the defendant opened and closed
an umbrella to frighten pheasants away from the plaintiff’s land. This
also constituted trespass.
Trespass to the subsoil

Trespass need not be committed against the surface of the land itself, it
can be committed against the subsoil (Cox v Moulsey (1848)).
Trespass to airspace

The old common law rule was that trespass could not be committed to
airspace (Pickering v Rudd (1815)).
This was rejected in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co Ltd (1957). In this case,
an advertising sign was overhanging the defendant’s property by eighth
inches; this constituted trespass.
The intrusion must be of a height to interfere with the plaintiff’s use
of the property (Lord Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews and General Ltd (1978)).
The plaintiff had objected to aircraft flying over his property and taking
aerial photographs. It was held that there was no interference with the
plaintiff’s property.
The rule was restricted in Anchor Brewhouse Developments Ltd v Berkley
House (Docklands Development) Ltd (1987). Here, booms from a crane were
overhanging the defendant’s property. It was said that the rule in Bernstein
did not apply to static structures.
Trespass ab initio

Where a defendant’s entry is with the authority of the law and the
defendant subsequently abuses that right, he becomes a trespasser ab
initio from the moment he enters onto the plaintiff’s land.
In Chic Fashions (West Wales) Ltd v Jones (1968), the police entered the
plaintiff’s premises with a warrant. They seized goods not mentioned
in the warrant but it was held that they were not trespassers as they had
general authority to look for stolen goods.

122

TORTS RELATING TO LAND

Nature of the interference
Trespass is a tort of intention but there is High Court authority that
trespass to land can be committed negligently. In League Against Cruel
Sports v Scott (1985), the defendants had been forbidden from allowing
their foxhounds to enter onto the land of the plaintiff. The defendant
had unintentionally been responsible for his hounds trespassing onto
the plaintiff’s land and was liable in trespass.
Defences
Licence

Where the defendant’s licence has been revoked by the plaintiff, he has
a reasonable time to leave the premises (Robson v Hallett).
A contractual licence can only be invoked in accordance with the
terms in the licence (Hurst v Picture Theatres Ltd (1915)).
Lawful authority

Examples would include entering pursuant to a right of way or exercise
of powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
Necessity

It is a defence to show it was necessary to enter onto the plaintiff’s land.
In Rigby v Chief Constable of Northamptonshire (1985), the police fired a
CS gas cylinder into a building to flush out a psychopath who was
sheltering there. The defence was applicable but the plaintiff was awarded
damages as the police were negligent in firing the equipment without
fire fighting equipment.
It was held in Monsanto plc v Tilly (1999) that the respondents, in a
claim for an injunction to restrain the destruction of genetically modified
crops, did not have a defence to a claim in trespass to land that their
actions were justified as being necessary to protect third parties or in
the public interest.
Remedies
Damages

Where the trespass is minimal, damages will be nominal. It was held in
Scutt v Lomax (2000) that, where trespass caused damage to land, a
claimant was entitled to the diminution in value or the reasonable costs
of reasonable reinstatement. In assessing the reasonable costs of reasonable

123

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

reinstatement, the court had to determine what amount, objectively, was
fair and an award would not be made if the amount was disproportionate
to the benefit.
Aggravated or exemplary damages will be awarded where appropriate.
Injunction

Where the trespass is continuing, the plaintiff is prima facie entitled to
an injunction. Where a trespass is threatened but not yet committed,
then the plaintiff may seek an injunction.
Re-entry

A person who is entitled to possession may re-enter the land and use
reasonable force. Forcible re-entry is a criminal offence under s 6 of the
Criminal Law Act 1977.
Mesne profits

The plaintiff may claim for profits which the defendant has obtained
from his occupation of the property, damages for deterioration of the
property and reasonable costs of obtaining possession.
Ejection

A right to ejection only exists where there is an immediate right to enter
the property.
Distress damage feasant

If a chattel is unlawfully on the plaintiff’s land and has done actual
damage to the plaintiff’s property, the plaintiff may retain the property
until the owner pays, or offers to pay, compensation for the damage
done.
The remedy of distress damage feasant was not available to a defendant
who had clamped a plaintiff’s car in Arthur v Anker (1995). The object
of the remedy was to take prompt action to stop or prevent damage to
the land or anything on it. Actual damage to the user of the land had to
be shown and the chattel was retained as security for a claim to be
compensated. From the facts of the case, it was clear that the leaseholders
had not suffered any damage. There was a flat charge to be released
from the clamp. It was the same charge, regardless of the duration of
the trespass and it was not paid to the leaseholders but to the agents
who fitted the clamp. The defendants did, however, have the defence
of consent (see Chapter 8).

124

TORTS RELATING TO LAND

The act of wheel-clamping a car was held to be trespass in Vine v
Waltham Forest LBC (2000) unless it could be shown that the owner had
consented to, or willingly assumed the risk of his car being clamped.
The car owner has to see and understand the significance of a warning
notice or notices that cars in that place are liable to be clamped.

Examples of defamatory statements
Defamation may take the form of the mere physical relationship of
objects. In Monson v Tussauds Ltd (1894), the defendants placed an effigy
of the plaintiff, against whom a charge of murder was ‘not proven’, close
to those of convicted murderers. It was held to be prima facie libel, although
an injunction was not granted.
In Youssoupoff v MGM (1934), the defendants implied, in a film, that
Princess Youssoupoff had been raped by Rasputin. This was held to be
a libel, on the basis that to say a woman had been raped would tend to
make her shunned and avoided, even though she is morally blameless.
Right thinking members of society

The test for defamation is whether the plaintiff would be lowered in the
eyes of ‘right thinking members of society’. In Byrne v Dean (1937), it
was alleged that a lampoon was defamatory because it accused the
plaintiff of ‘sneaking’ to the police about unlawful gambling in his club.
The action of the club committee in allowing the lampoon to remain on
the notice board did not constitute defamation, since members of society
would not be right thinking if they thought it defamatory to say that a
man had discharged his public duty to help suppress crime.

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

The difference between libel and slander
Libel is the written or permanent form of defamation. Slander is the
spoken or otherwise transient form.
Libel

Slander
Temporary

See, also, s 1 of the Defamation Act 1996; ss 4 and 7 of the Theatres Act 1968
Actionable per se

Not actionable per se,

Never a crime unless
blasphemous

What constitutes special damage?
Some actual loss, the loss of some material or temporal advantage which
is pecuniary or capable of being estimated in money, for example, the
loss or refusal of an office or employment or the dismissal from a situation,
the loss of a client or dealing.
As a special rule, slander is not actionable per se. However, there are
exceptions.
Criminal offence

Where the words impute a crime for which the plaintiff can be made to
suffer physically by way of punishment. The crime concerned does not
have to be an indictable one but it has to be one which the plaintiff could
be punished with imprisonment in the first instance.
The words ‘you are a convicted person’ were found to mean that a
crime punishable corporally was imputed in Gray v Jones (1939), since,
although they would not place the plaintiff in jeopardy, they would
cause him to be ostracised socially.
The general feeling behind the exception is the social ostracism that
would result from such a slander.
Disease

Where the words impute to the plaintiff a contagious or infectious disease,
then that is a form of slander actionable per se. Decided cases have held

128

DEFAMATION

that leprosy, venereal disease and perhaps the plague come within this
exception. However, it must be contagious or infectious – an oral imputation
of insanity is not actionable without proof of special damage (unless it
comes within one of the other exceptions).
It was held in Bloodworth v Gray (1844) that to infer that a person has
a contagious venereal disease is to commit slander per se.
Unchastity of a woman

By s 1 of the Slander of Women Act 1891, where the words impute
adultery or unchastity to a woman or girl.
Incompetence

Where the words are calculated to disparage the plaintiff in any office,
profession, calling, trade or business held or carried on by him at the
time of publication under s 2 of the Defamation Act 1952.
Who can sue?
The tort of defamation protects an individual’s interest in his reputation.
It was suggested by the Faulks Committee that the purpose of the law
of defamation is to strike a balance between a person’s interest in their
reputation and the general right of free speech.
It was in the interests of free speech that the House of Lords overruled
the decision in Bognor Regis UDC v Campion (1972) in Derbyshire CC v
Times Newspapers Ltd (1993). The former case held that a local authority
had an interest in its governing reputation, whereas the latter held that
if local authorities could sue in defamation then that would inhibit free
speech. In the Court of Appeal, reliance had been placed on Art 10 of
the European Convention on Human Rights (despite the fact that the
Convention had not at the time been incorporated into English law) but
the House of Lords relied on a common law principle of free speech.
The case of Derbyshire CC v Times Newspapers Ltd concerned the question
of whether a council itself as opposed to a member or officer could sue
in libel. The case of Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd (1999) concerned an
individual public official, a former Irish Prime Minister, and it was held
that such an individual could sue, but the media are entitled to some
protection when commenting on matters of public interest (see further,
below).
Derbyshire CC v Times Newspapers Ltd was distinguished in Steel v
McDonaldÕ s Corporation (1999) when it was held that a commercial

129

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

corporation is constitutionally different from an elected authority in that
it can maintain an action for libel.
A trading corporation can sue in defamation in order to protect its
commercial reputation (Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Co v Hawkins (1859)).
A trade union used to be able to sue in defamation but s 2(1) of the
Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 deprives a trade union of
the right to incorporated status with the result that it lacks the necessary
legal personality.
A person can only bring a defamation action during their lifetime
and the right does not survive for the benefit of the deceased’s estate.
Legal aid is not available for a defamation action. This has lead to it
being called a rich man’s tort. It was held in Joyce v Sengupta (1993) that
the plaintiff can bring an alternative cause of action, for which legal aid
would be available, in this case malicious falsehood, even though the
defendant would then be deprived of the right to jury trial.

Essentials of defamation
The plaintiff has to prove the following in order to establish the existence
of defamation:
• that the statement was defamatory;
• that the statement referred to the plaintiff;
• that the statement was published.
The words must be defamatory
Words can be defamatory in a wide variety of situations. In Sim v Stretch
(1936), the defendant sent a telegram to the plaintiff, stating ‘Edith has
resumed her position with us today. Please send her possessions and
the money you borrowed, also her wages ...’. In an action for libel, the
plaintiff argued that the words of the telegram were defamatory, as they
suggested that, out of necessity, he had borrowed money from the
housemaid and that he had failed to pay her wages. The test applied
was ‘would the words lower the plaintiff in the eyes of right thinking
members of society?’. The claim failed as the words were not capable
of a defamatory meaning.
The test was also applied in Byrne v Dean with the result, again, that
the defendant was not liable, as right thinking members of society would

130

DEFAMATION

report illegal activities to the police. So, it could not be defamatory to
suggest that someone had done so.
Different problems arose in Tolley v Fry (1931). The plaintiff was a
leading amateur golfer. Without his knowledge or consent, the defendants
issued an advertisement showing the plaintiff playing golf with a packet
of chocolate in his pocket. The plaintiff felt that this compromised his
amateur status and he brought an action for libel alleging that the
advertisement meant that the plaintiff had, for gain and reward, agreed
to its publication. It was held to be defamatory.
What constitutes defamation should be distinguished from mere
vulgar abuse which may injure someone’s dignity but not their reputation.
In Penfold v Westcote (1806), the words ‘you blackguard, rascal, scoundrel,
Penfold, you are a thief’ were a mixture of both defamation and abuse.
‘Blackguard’, etc, was abuse, but was defamatory in conjunction with
the word ‘thief’.
The plaintiff in Field v Davis (1955) had been called ‘a tramp’, which
was held capable of a defamatory meaning but on the facts of the case
and the plaintiff’s temper when he made the remarks they was obviously
meant as vulgar abuse.
Function of judge and jury
It is the judge’s function to decide as a matter of law whether the statement
is reasonably capable of bearing the defamatory meaning alleged by the
plaintiff. If he is not satisfied, then he withdraws the case from the jury.
The jury’s function is to decide as a matter of fact whether the statement
complained of is defamatory, in that particular case.
In Lewis v Daily Telegraph (1963), the defendants printed articles stating
that the Fraud Squad were inquiring into the affairs of the plaintiff. It
was alleged that the words were defamatory on their ordinary and
natural meaning. On appeal, it was held that the judge should have
ruled whether the words were capable of bearing the defamatory meaning
put forward and that the jury should have been directed that they could
have not meant this meaning.
Since the case of John v MGN Ltd (1995), the judge also provides
guidance to libel juries in their role of assessing compensatory damages.
The judge may make reference to an appropriate figure, which would
compensate the plaintiff, or to brackets of awards. In addition, the judge
may make reference to conventional personal injury awards which acts
as a check on the reasonableness of the awards that the jury is proposing
to make.

131

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

It was also held that it was for the judge to set down limits to the
possible range of meanings which could be inferred from words complained
of as being defamatory and for the jury to decide the actual meaning
within that range (Mapp v News Group Newspapers Ltd (1997)).
Juries do not hear and determine cases under the offer to make amends
procedure contained in ss 2–4 of the Defamation Act 1996 nor under the
fast track procedure under ss 8–10 of the Defamation Act 1996.
It was also stated by the House of Lords in Reynolds v Times Newspapers
Ltd (1999) that it is a question of law for the judge whether an occasion
was privileged. The question of whether a privileged occasion has been
abused by malice is a question of fact for the jury.
Determining the meaning of the words complained of
The plaintiff may complain of the natural and ordinary meaning of the
words (Lewis v Daily Telegraph).
Natural and ordinary meaning

The natural and ordinary meaning is that which is conveyed to the
ordinary, reasonable and fair-minded reader. The jury must decide a
single meaning that would be conveyed to such a reader and cannot
divide readers into different groups, with some groups inferring different
meanings to others.
These principles were recently upheld by the House of Lords in
Charleston v News Group Newspapers Ltd (1995). The plaintiffs played a
respectable married couple in the Australian soap opera Neighbours.
Photographs of their faces had been superimposed onto photographs
of two near naked bodies, apparently engaging in an obscene act. There
was an additional photograph of the female plaintiff superimposed onto
a photograph of a topless woman. Above the photographs was a headline
which read: ‘Strewth! What’s Harold up to with our Madge?’ Below the
photographs was a smaller headline which stated: ‘Porn Shocker for
Neighbours Stars.’ The text of the article which followed made it clear
that the faces had been superimposed by the makers of a computer game,
without the plaintiffs’ knowledge or consent. The article roundly
condemned the makers of the computer game. Readers of the entire
article would have known that the plaintiffs had not consented to the
photographs, but they argued that those reading only the headlines
would have drawn a different inference. The idea that readers could be
divided into different groups, with these groups inferring different
meanings, was rejected.

132

DEFAMATION

Guidelines to the meaning to be attributed to particular words was
provided by Neill LJ in Gillick v BBC (1995) (following Sir Thomas
Bingham MR in Skuse v Granada Television (1993)), as follows:
• the natural and ordinary meaning was that conveyed to the ordinary
reasonable viewer/reader;
• the hypothetical reader or viewer was not naive but he was not unduly
suspicious. He could indulge in loose thinking and could read in an
implication more readily than a lawyer. But, he was not avid for
scandal and did not select one bad meaning when other non-defamatory
meanings were available;
• the court should be cautious of over-elaborate analysis;
• the reasonable viewer/reader would not give the analytical attention
that a lawyer would to a document, an auditor to the interpretation
of accounts or an academic to the content of a learned article;
• the court were entitled to have regard to the impression made;
• the court should not be too literal in its approach;
• a statement was defamatory if it lowered people in the eyes of right
thinking members of society.
The word spoken by a participant in a discussion on a live television
programme that, ‘there were at least two reported cases of suicide by
girls who were pregnant’ after the success of a legal action brought by
a campaigner opposed to giving contraceptive advice to girls, were
capable of bearing the defamatory meaning that the campaigner was
morally responsible for the deaths. However, note now the statutory
defence contained in s 1 of the Defamation Act 1996. This provides, inter
alia, that a broadcaster of a live programme containing a statement in
circumstances in which he has no effective control over the maker of a
statement has a statutory defence.
It was held by the Court of Appeal in Botham v Khan (1996) that, in
deciding whether an alleged libel was capable of bearing a particular
meaning, the important point was what the defendant said the plaintiff
had done, not what the defendant thought was the true quality of the
act. The defendant had alleged that the plaintiff had been involved in
ball tampering in cricket, which was contrary to the rules. He went on
to state that he did not consider it cheating. The important point was
that the plaintiff had been accused of cheating and it did not make any
difference that in the defendant’s opinion it was not considered to be
cheating. The words were capable of being defamatory and it was for
the jury to decide.

133

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

The plaintiff must normally give details of the meanings he ascribes
to the words complained of. Where a plaintiff relies on the ordinary
meaning of words but those words have more than one ordinary meaning,
or have acquired a meaning outside their common or dictionary definitions,
it is desirable and may be necessary, for the plaintiff to give particulars
of all the meanings inherent in the words.
In Allsop v Church of England Newspaper (1976), the plaintiff, a well
known broadcaster, claimed damages from the defendants for having
twice referred to his ‘preoccupation with the bent’, within the context
of pornography, violence, sex and obscenity on the screen. The plaintiff
relied on the ordinary meaning of the words and there was no plea of
innuendo.
It was held that the word ‘bent’ was used as slang in a context that
made its meaning imprecise and the plaintiff had to give particulars of
every meaning he felt was inherent in the words. This would apply even
if ‘true’ or ‘false’ innuendo or even the ‘natural and ordinary meaning’
of the words is relied on.
Innuendo

An apparently innocent statement may nevertheless be defamatory if it
contains an innuendo. So, the plaintiff may claim that the words are
defamatory in the light of external facts and circumstances known to
persons seeing/ hearing the words – the innuendo.
An innuendo must be specially pleaded, that is, the plaintiff must
state the grounds (with supporting evidence, for example, his special
knowledge) on which he alleges that the apparently innocent remark is
defamatory, that is, he must prove the meaning that he alleges to the
words.
An innuendo may arise, not from the words but from the facts and
circumstances surrounding the publication. In Cassidy v Daily Mirror
(1929), under the heading ‘Today’s Gossip’, the Daily Mirror published
a photograph of the plaintiff’s husband and a certain Miss X ‘whose
engagement has been announced’. The defendants maintained that they
had received the photograph in the ordinary course of business and had
published it in good faith. The plaintiff was living apart from her husband
and alleged that the words were defamatory since the innuendo was
that she was not married to her husband.
It was held that the publication could be defamatory and, since the jury
found that the caption conveyed to reasonably minded people an aspersion
on the plaintiff’s moral character, she was entitled to succeed.
It is not necessary to show, however, that anyone having knowledge
of the extrinsic facts and seeing or hearing the words would actually

134

DEFAMATION

understand them as defamatory. It was held in Hough v London Express
(1940) that the ‘fact of defamation’ refers to the defamatory meaning of
the words, not their effect on the plaintiff’s reputation because it is
irrelevant that the statement is not believed to be true by anyone to
whom it is published.
It is not necessary to show that the defendant knew of the extrinsic
facts which made the words defamatory, as in Cassidy v Daily Mirror.
However, ss 2–4 of the Defamation Act 1996 provides a defence of making
amends through an ‘offer of amends’.
The words must refer to the plaintiff
If the plaintiff is mentioned by name, there is usually no difficulty about
this and furthermore there is no requirement that the defendant should
have intended to refer to the plaintiff.
In Hulton v Jones (1908), the plaintiffs were newspaper proprietors
and published in their newspaper a humourous account of a motor
festival in Dieppe in which imputations were cast on the morals of
Artemus Jones, a church warden at Peckham. This person was believed
by the writers of the article to be fictitious. In fact, there was a barrister
named Artemus Jones who was not a churchwarden, did not live in
Peckham and had taken no part in the Dieppe festival.
He sued the defendants for libel and friends swore that they believed
that the article referred to the plaintiff. The plaintiff succeeded and it
was immaterial that the defendants did not intend to defame him. In
the words of an American judge, the question is not who it aimed at but
who is hit.
In the case of Newstead v London Express (1939), the Court of Appeal
carried Hulton v Jones further in two directions.
They held that:
• the principle applies where the statement truly relates to a real person,
A, and is mistakenly but reasonably thought to refer to another real
person, B; and
• absence of negligence on the defendant’s part is relevant only in the
sense that it may be considered by the jury in determining whether
reasonable people would regard the statement as referring to the
plaintiff, otherwise it is no defence.
In the Newstead case, the statement was ‘Harold Newstead, 30 year old
Camberwell man’ has been convicted of bigamy. This was true of a
Camberwell barman of that name but it was untrue of the plaintiff,

135

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Harold Newstead aged about 30 who helped his father in a hairdressing
business in Camberwell. The defendants were liable, although it must
be remembered that if the case was heard today the defence under s 4
of the Defamation Act 1996 would be available.
Material may be defamatory of the plaintiff even where it does not
refer to him by name and even if it contains no ‘key or pointer’ indicating
that it refers to him.
In Morgan v Odhams Press (1971), a newspaper article alleged that a girl
had been kidnapped by a dog-doping gang. At the relevant time, the girl
had been staying at the plaintiff’s flat and the plaintiff produced six
witnesses who swore that they believed that the article referred to the
plaintiff. The House of Lords held that these facts constituted sufficient
material to leave to the jury.
The test of whether the words ‘refer to the plaintiff’ is whether the
hypothetical, sensible reader having knowledge of the special circumstances
would believe that the plaintiff was referred to and due allowance must
be made for the fact that such a reader will not give a sensational article
in a popular newspaper the attention a lawyer would bestow on a perusal
of evidence. Nor is it relevant that the person who actually read the
defamatory article believed it to be true.
Class defamation
The question whether an individual can sue in respect of words which
are directed against a group, body or class of persons generally was
considered by the House of Lords in Knupffer v London Express Newspapers
Ltd (1944).
It was held that:
• the crucial question was whether the words were published ‘of the
plaintiff’ in the sense that he can be said to be personally pointed at
rather than the application of any arbitrary general rule that liability
cannot arise from words published of a class;
• normally where the defamatory statement is directed to a class of
persons no individual belonging to the class of persons is entitled to
say that the words were written or spoken of himself.
Thus, a class cannot be defamed as a class nor can an individual be
defamed by general reference to the class to which he belongs.
The plaintiff must show that he was personally pointed at and where
words are directed at a class, no individual will be able to rely on an

136

DEFAMATION

action unless the class is so limited that words apply to each member
as an individual.
The words must be published
Publication means the communication of words to at least one other
person, other than the person defamed. For there to be injury to the
plaintiff’s reputation, communication to the plaintiff himself is not
enough. In Huth v Huth (1914), the defamatory material was in an unsealed
letter sent through the post and the letter was opened and read by an
inquisitive butler. As it was no part of his duty to do this, there was no
publication for which the defendant was responsible. Although the
defendant had been unwise in not sealing the envelope, the butler’s
behaviour was not a direct consequence of sending the letter.
The situation will be different where the defendant can reasonably
anticipate that someone other than the plaintiff will open the envelope,
even where the letter is addressed to the plaintiff. In Theaker v Richardson
(1962), the defendant wrote to the plaintiff accusing her of shoplifting,
being ‘a very dirty whore’ and a ‘lying, low-down brothel-keeping whore
and thief’. He put it in a manilla envelope, which he addressed to the
plaintiff and put it through her letter box. Her husband opened it thinking
that it was an election address. The plaintiff succeeded and on appeal,
it was held that there was a finding of fact by the jury which could not
be disturbed.
Husband and wife situations

Communication of defamatory material by a husband to his wife or vice
versa, is not a publication for the purposes of defamation. However, if
someone wrote to the husband about the wife or vice versa, that would
be defamation.
Repetition

Every repetition of defamatory words is a fresh publication and creates
a fresh cause of action. Furthermore, where a libel is contained in a television
programme or newspaper article there is a separate publication to every
person who read the newspaper or saw the programme, though in practice
the plaintiff will normally sue in respect of the edition or broadcast.
A distinction is made between a mere distributor and a person who
takes an active part in the production of the print.
Romer LJ set down some guidelines in Vizetelly v MudieÕ s Select Library
(1900) which seems to determine when a distributor would be liable.

137

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Basically, the distributor will be able to claim a good defence if they can
prove:
(a) that they were innocent of any knowledge of the libel contained in
the work; and
(b) that there was nothing in the work or in the circumstances in which
it came to them or was disseminated by them which ought to have
led them to suppose that it contained a libel; and
(c) that when the work was disseminated by them, it was not by any
negligence on their part that they did not know that it contained a
libel.
In the later case of Sun Life v WH Smith (1934), Scrutton LJ felt that (b)
and (c) might be combined into a single question ‘ought the defendant
to have known that the matter was defamatory’, that is, was it due to
his negligence in conducting his business that he did not know?
In VizetellyÕ s case, the proprietors of a circulating library were held
liable because they took no steps to ascertain whether their books
contained libels and had overlooked a publisher’s request for return of
copies of the particular book.
Section 1 of the Defamation Act 1996 creates a new statutory defence
for distributors, printers, Internet providers, broadcasters of a live
programme concerning statements where the broadcaster has no effective
control over the maker of the statement and others. This defence supersedes
the old common law defence of ‘innocent dissemination’. The defence
is available to a person if he shows that he was not the author, editor or
publisher of the statement complained of, he took reasonable care in
relation to his publication, and he did not know and had no reason to
believe, that what he did caused or contributed to the publication of a
defamatory statement. Regard shall be had to the extent of his responsibility
for the content of the statement or decision to publish it; the nature or
circumstances of the publication and the previous conduct or character
of the author, editor or publisher.
In Godfrey v Demon Internet Ltd (1999), an Internet service provider
was held to be responsible for material carried on its computers and can
be sued for libel.
The defendants posted on the Internet material that defamed the
plaintiff. Despite being informed by the plaintiff, the defendants failed
to take any action. Nearly 18 months later, another posting of defamatory
material occurred and again the defendants failed to do anything about
it.

138

DEFAMATION

The defence under s 1 of the Defamation Act 1996 only applies if
‘reasonable care [is taken] in relation to … publication’, and the defendant
‘does not know and had no reason to believe that what he did caused
or contributed to the publication of defamatory material’.
The situation is in contrast with that in the US where the Supreme
Court has ruled that Internet service providers are not liable when
someone is defamed in e-mails or bulletin board messages.
A repetition of a defamatory statement is normally too remote for the
defendant to be responsible for it, however, there must be a break in the
chain of causation. In Slipper v BBC (1991), the plaintiff argued that
damages should be increased to take cognisance of the fact that the
defendant had invited press reviews of the film which repeated the
defamation. The Court of Appeal held that re-publication was an aspect
of novus actus interveniens and it was arguable that the defendants could
reasonably foresee and anticipate as a natural and probable consequence
that the sting of the libel would be repeated in the national press. It was
a question of fact for the jury to decide whether the defendant invited
such reviews.
Assent to publication

If the plaintiff expressly or impliedly assents to the publication of matter
which is true on the face of it, the defendant is not liable and this is so
even if it appears that some persons may interpret the statement in a
sense much more prejudicial to the plaintiff than is warranted by the
plain meaning of the words. The plaintiff should have considered the
possibility of this happening before he assented to publication.
In Cookson v Harewood (1932), the plaintiff sued the defendants for
libel because they had published a true statement that the plaintiff had
been warned off all pony racing tracks under their control. The plaintiff
had submitted to the rules of the Pony Turf Club which the defendants
controlled and one of these rules was that the stewards of the club might,
in their absolute discretion, warn off any person. The plaintiff contended
that if, by innuendo, the jury interpreted the statement as meaning that
he had been guilty of corrupt and fraudulent practices, then the defendants
were liable. The Court of Appeal held that this argument was unsound.
Scrutton LJ maintained there was no liability if it was a true statement
and there was authority to publish the true statement, it did not matter
what people understood it to mean. In the same way, if a statement is
defamatory its meaning does not matter, it is still defamatory.

139

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Defences
Offer to make amends
A defence of offer of amends is contained in ss 2–4 of the Defamation
Act 1996. This repeals the previous defence of unintentional defamation
contained in s 4 of the Defamation Act 1952.
A person who has published a statement alleged to be defamatory of
another may make an offer of amends.
The offer may be in relation to the statement generally or in relation
to a specific defamatory meaning which the person making the offer
accepts that the statement conveys (‘a qualified offer’). A qualified offer
would be made where a defendant accepts that the statement is partially
untrue or where the defendant claims the statement is intended to have
a less serious meaning than that claimed by a plaintiff. For example, a
newspaper runs a story about a surgeon who is involved in an operation
that has had a disastrous outcome. The surgeon claims that the article
is imputing malice but the newspaper claims that it is an allegation of
incompetence. The newspaper could make a qualified offer in relation
to the less serious meaning. If the offer is refused, the newspaper would
have a defence, if it was found that the statement meant incompetence.
An offer to make amends must comply with the following criteria, under
s 3 of the Defamation Act 1996:
• it must be in writing;
• must be expressed to be an offer to make amends under s 2 of the
Defamation Act 1996;
• must state whether it is a qualified offer and, if so, set out the defamatory
meaning in relation to what is made.
An offer to make amends is an offer to do the following:
• make a suitable correction and sufficient apology;
• to publish the correction and apology in a reasonable and practicable
manner;
• to pay compensation (if any) and costs.
Where the offer is accepted, s 3 of the Defamation Act 1996 applies.
Defamation proceedings cannot be brought or continued but the offer
can be enforced in accordance with the section. Where the parties are
agreed on the steps required to fulfil the offer, the aggrieved party may
apply to the court for an order that the party take the agreed steps. If
the parties do not agree on the correction, apology and publication, the

140

DEFAMATION

party who made the offer may make the correction and apology in open
court in terms approved by the court, and give an undertaking to the
court as to the manner of their publication.
Where the parties do not agree, compensation and costs are determined
in the same way as in defamation proceedings. Proceedings under this
section are heard without a jury.
Where the offer is not accepted, the situation is governed by s 4 of
the Defamation Act 1996. The fact that the offer was made is a defence
except where the person who made the offer knew or had reason to
believe that the statement complained of referred to the plaintiff or was
likely to be understood as referring to the plaintiff and was both false
and defamatory. A qualified offer is only a defence in respect of the
meaning to which the offer related. The offer can also be relied on in
mitigation of damages, whether or not it was used as a defence.
The new offer to make amends defence differs from the previous
defence of unintentional defamation, in that the defendant can be liable
to pay compensation, even in cases of unintentional defamation. Under
the old defence, only an apology and costs would have been paid.
Justification
Justification consists of proof that the allegedly defamatory matter was
true. Justification is a dangerous defence because, if it fails, heavier
damages will be awarded. On the other hand, if the defendant’s statement
are true, the defence will avail even if he did not believe them to be true
or made them with malice.
Onus of proof

The defendant must prove that the statement was true as opposed to
the plaintiff proving its falsity. Justification must be specially pleaded.
Substantial truth suffices

It is sufficient to prove the substantial truth of the statement, that is, a
minor inaccuracy will not vitiate the defence. Whether the inaccuracy
was minor is a matter of fact for the jury.
In Alexander v North Eastern Railway Co (1865), a sentence of ‘five or
14 days’ was reported as ‘five or three weeks’. This was held to be not
sufficiently inaccurate to defeat justification. Conversely, however, ‘the
justification must be as broad as the charge’.
In Lewis v Daily Telegraph (1964), the defendants printed an article
stating that the fraud squad were inquiring into the affairs of the plaintiff
company. It was alleged that the words were defamatory on their ‘ordinary

141

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

and literal meaning’. The defendants were able to justify the words according
to their ordinary and literal meaning. The House of Lords held that the
words were incapable of being defamatory per se. Therefore, the defence
of justification is distinct from the question whether the words are defamatory;
although the two are interlocked to some extent.
Effect of the Defamation Act 1952

Section 5 provides that justification will not fail merely because the truth
of one of several charges is not established, if, having regard to the other
charges, it did not do material injury to the plaintiff’s reputation.
Problems in the working of s 5 in practice were revealed by Speidel v
Plato Films (1961). The plaintiff was the subject of a film made by the
defendants, in which several allegations were made against him. The
plaintiff only complained about two specific allegations, which the
defendant was unable to prove, although they were able to prove equally
discreditable allegations. The wider content of the film could not be
introduced by the defendants to prove that the overall effect of the film
had not damaged the plaintiff’s reputation and because only specific
allegations had been complained of s 5 did not come into effect. It was
possible, however, to prove that the plaintiff had a bad reputation in
order to reduce the amount of damages.
The rule in Plato v Speidel Films (1961) only applies where there are
distinct allegations and will not apply where allegations have a common
sting. In Polly Peck (Holdings) plc v Trelford (1986), the plaintiff claimed
damages in respect of the whole of one article and parts of two others.
The defendant pleaded justification and fair comment. It was held that
the defendant could prove the truth of the sting by proving the truth of
the statements which the plaintiff has not complained of.
The Faulks Committee recommended the amendment of s 5 so that
the defendant could rely on the whole publication in assessing the truth
of a selected part.
Defendant’s motive irrelevant

The defence of justification, if otherwise good, will not fail because the
defendant acted from a malicious or improper motive. However, an
honest and reasonable but mistaken belief in the statement will not
suffice to support justification.

142

DEFAMATION

Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974

Section 8 provides that where the plaintiff was defamed by the raising
against him of a ‘spent’ conviction, proof of the truth of the allegation
will not avail as a defence if the statement was published with malice.
In the past, the application of the principles concerning the defence
of justification gave rise to particular difficulty where the defamatory
statement was to the effect that the plaintiff had been convicted of a
criminal offence. At common law, a conviction was not even prima facie
evidence of guilt for the purposes of other proceedings and this meant
that the defendant had to prove the guilt for the purposes of other
proceedings which in turn meant that the defendant had to prove the
guilt of the plaintiff again if the defence of justification was to succeed.
However, by s 13 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968, in an action for libel
or slander, where the question is whether a person committed a criminal
offence, the fact that he stands convicted of the offence is conclusive
evidence that he did commit it.
Rumour

It was held in Aspro Travel Ltd v Owners Abroad Group plc (1995) that
hearsay and rumour could not constitute justification for an assertion
of fact in defamation proceedings. However, in certain circumstances,
a person could repeat a rumour before being satisfied that it is true and
plead in justification that there are such rumours.
Fair comment on a matter of public interest
Definition

Fair comment is comment honestly made on a matter of public interest.
Comment means opinion

The defendant must prove that the statement was comment, that is, one
of opinion, not fact. If the statement consists of facts, justification is the
appropriate defence.
In London Artists Ltd v Littler (1969), the defendant, a well known
impresario, was presenting a play in the West End. Four of the leading
actors, through their agent, London Artists Ltd, simultaneously gave
notice to leave the cast. The defendant in a letter published in the press,
alleged a conspiracy by them to being the run of the play to an end. When
sued for libel, he raised a defence of fair comment. The defence failed,
the allegation of conspiracy was, in the circumstances, a statement of
fact, not of opinion and therefore not ‘comment’. Whereas, in Dakhyl v

143

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Labouchere (1908), the plaintiff described himself as a ‘specialist for the
treatment of deafness, ear, nose and throat diseases’. The defendant
described him as ‘a quack of the rankest species’. The House of Lords
held that this might be comment.
Good faith is essential

The defendant must have made the comment in good faith, that is,
believing in the truth of the statement and without malicious distortion.
In Telnikoff v Matusevitch (1990), it was held by the Court of Appeal that
the comment need only be considered fair by an objective test, that is,
would a reasonable man have an held an honest belief in the truth of
the statement. This is a question of burden of proof. The defendant does
not have to prove that he had an honest belief in the truth of the statement,
it is for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant acted with malice.
A newspaper publishing a letter does not lose the defence of fair
comment simply because it cannot prove that its’ correspondent did not
have an honest belief in the statement (Lyon v Daily Telegraph (1943)).
Public interest is essential

The defendant must prove that the matter commented on was one of
public interest. This is given a wide definition. Lord Denning in London
Artists v Littler (1969) said:
Whenever a matter is such as to affect people at large, so that they
may be legitimately interested in, or concerned at, what is going on;
or what may happen to them or to others; then it is a matter of public
interest on which everyone is entitled to make a fair comment.
Fairness is not synonymous with moderation

Although the comment must be fair, that is, the honestly held opinion
of the defendant, ‘fair comment does not mean moderate comment’. The
opinion of the court or the jury must not be substituted for that of the
defendant (McQuire v Western Morning News (1903)). The test is ‘Was
this an opinion, however exaggerated, obstinate or prejudiced, which
was honestly held by the writer?’ (Silkin v Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd
(1958)) per Diplock J. This lead the Faulks Committee to recommend
that ‘fair comment’ should be changed to ‘comment’.
Fact and comment

Section 6 of the Defamation Act 1952 provides that in an action for libel
and slander in respect of words consisting partly of allegations of fact
and partly expressions of opinion, a defence of fair comment shall not

144

DEFAMATION

fail by reason only that the truth of every allegation of fact is not proved,
if the expression of opinion is fair comment having regard to such of
the facts alleged or referred to in the words complained of as are proved.
Formerly, the slightest inaccuracy in the facts stated defeated fair comment.
The ‘rolled up’ plea

Fact and comment are difficult to separate. Because of this, the plea is
sometimes couched in the terms:
... in so far as the words complained of are statements of fact, they
are true in substance and in fact; and, in so far as they consist of
comment, they are fair comment on a matter of public interest.

This is the ‘rolled up’ plea – a plea of fair comment, not justification. The
facts are proved merely to lay a foundation for the defence of fair comment.
Furthermore, the Rules of Court provide that the plaintiff is entitled to
be informed of the facts on which the defendant intends to rely.
It is not necessary to set out all the facts on which the writer has based
his opinion. A passing reference to the facts can be sufficient, as in Kemsley
v Foot (1952). The defendant attacked an article in the Evening Standard.
The article appeared under the heading ‘Lower than Kemsley’ but no
other reference was made to Kemsley, who was a newspaper proprietor.
This was a sufficient reference to the facts on which the opinion had
been based, that is, the conduct of the Kemsley press.
It is not possible when determining whether the comment is fact or
opinion to have regard to other documents incorporated into the statement.
In Telnikoff v Matusevitch (1991), the defendant had published a letter in
a newspaper in response to an article published by the plaintiff, which
was referred to in the letter. The House of Lords held that it was not
possible to look at the article in determining whether the letter was a
statement of fact or opinion.
Where the defendant’s comments are based on a report of judicial
proceedings, the onus is on the defendant to prove that the report is fair
and accurate and therefore privileged. In Brent Walker plc v Time Out Ltd
(1991), the defendant pleaded fair comment based on privileged statements
made about the plaintiff at a trial in 1956. The plaintiff claimed that the
statements did not form part of a fair and accurate report of the proceedings.
It was held that the defendant had to show that the report was fair and
accurate.
Malice

Malice may defeat fair comment. The malice must distort the comment
to vitiate the defence. In Thomas v Bradbury Agnew & Co Ltd (1906), the

145

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

writer of a review made untrue allegations of fact and harboured personal
spite against the author. The comment was distorted by malice and
therefore not fair.
Absolute privilege
A statement which is absolutely privileged is not actionable under any
circumstances. The following classes of statements are absolutely
privileged.
Those made in either House of Parliament

This stems from the Bill of Rights 1689, which stated:
The freedom of speech and debates of the proceedings of Parliament
ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place
outside of Parliament.

The Privy Council case of Prebble v Television New Zealand Ltd (1994) held
that parliamentary privilege prohibits any suggestion being made in
court proceedings that statements made in the House were lies or
motivated by a desire to mislead and also prohibits suggestions that
legislation was passed as part of a conspiracy. It was also held that an
individual Member of Parliament could not override parliamentary
privilege, as privilege belonged to Parliament itself.
It was held in Allason v Haines (1995) that it would be a breach of
parliamentary privilege to bring evidence of a Member of Parliament’s
behaviour in the House of Commons. However, the action was stayed,
as this deprived the defendants’ of their defence.
The common law position has now been changed as a result of s 13
of the Defamation Act 1996. This allows a person, where his conduct in
or in relation to proceedings in Parliament is in issue in defamation
proceedings, to waive, so far as concerns him, the protection of any
enactment or rule of law which prevents proceedings in Parliament
being impeached or questioned in any court or place outside Parliament.
This enables a Member of either House of Parliament to clear his name
if he is alleged to have acted dishonestly or improperly in connection
with his parliamentary duties.
The House of Lords considered s 13 of the Defamation Act 1996 in
Hamilton v Al Fayed (No 1) (2000). It was held that parliamentary privilege
belongs to the House of Commons exclusively and not to individual
Members. Nevertheless, s 13 permits an individual Member of Parliament
to waive the privilege afforded to him by virtue of the role. Consequently,
any challenge to parliamentary procedures, including a challenge to the

146

DEFAMATION

findings of a parliamentary inquiry into conduct would not infringe
parliamentary privilege.
Reports of parliamentary proceedings

Reports of parliamentary proceedings published by order of either
House, or their re-publication in full (Parliamentary Papers Act 1840).
Judicial proceedings

Statements made by judges, advocates, witnesses or parties:
• in the course of judicial proceedings, civil or military; or
• with reference to such proceedings.
Addis v Crocker (1961) extended this immunity to tribunals exercising
judicial as distinct from administrative functions. An order of the
Disciplinary Tribunal of the Law Society was therefore held to be absolutely
privileged.
A licensing application is an administrative function and is not
privileged (Royal Aquarium Society Ltd v Parkinson (1892)).
Communications between lawyer and client

Professional communications between solicitor and client possess qualified
privilege on the grounds that the interests of justice demand it. The
communication must be made by or to the solicitor in his professional
capacity and must be relevant to the relationship of solicitor and client,
having regard to the business in hand.
It seems generally agreed that the privilege is qualified but the point
is not absolutely free from doubt since the Court of Appeal has treated
it on separate occasions as both absolute and qualified and in Minter v
Priest (1930) the House of Lords expressly reserved its opinion.
Officers of State

A statement is absolutely privileged if made by one officer of State to
another in the course of official duty. Chatterton v Secretary of State for
India (1895) involved a communication by a Minister to the Under
Secretary of State for India to enable him to answer a parliamentary
question. That was privileged.
The following have been held to be ‘officers of State’:
• a military officer reporting to his superiors;
• a Minister communicating with an official;
• a High Commissioner reporting to Prime Minister.

147

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Statements made in the UK by officials of foreign governments are
probably protected by diplomatic immunity.
Husband and wife

Statements made by one spouse to another are absolutely privileged but
statements by one spouse to a third party about the other are not.
Reports of court proceedings

Under s 14 of the Defamation Act 1996, a fair and accurate report of
proceedings before a court is absolutely privileged if published
contemporaneously with proceedings. Where reports of proceedings
are postponed by court order or statutory provision, a publication is
treated as contemporaneous if it as published as soon as is practicable
after permission is granted. The section applies to:
•
•
•
•

any court in the UK;
the European Court of Justice and any court attached to that court;
the European Court of Human Rights;
any international criminal tribunal established by the Security Council
of the United Nations or by an international agreement to which the
UK is a party.

Qualified privilege
For a statement to enjoy qualified privilege there must be:
• a legal, moral or social duty to make it on one side;
• a corresponding interest to receive it on the other.
Both these conditions must be satisfied.
Reports of parliamentary, judicial and public proceedings

Reports of the statements should not be confused with the statements
themselves, for example, by a judge in court or an MP in the House,
which are absolutely privileged.
Fair and accurate reports of judicial proceedings

Public proceedings in any court of justice enjoy qualified privilege at
common law. This extends to foreign courts if the matter is of legitimate
interest to the British public.

148

DEFAMATION

This privilege does not extend to:
• tribunals to which the public is not admitted;
• domestic tribunals;
• cases of which the subject matter is obscene or blasphemous.
Fair and accurate reports of parliamentary debates

This extends to certain other bodies, such as statutory commissions,
where it is in the public interest that their proceedings should be
published.
Section 15 of the Defamation Act 1996

Section 15 gives qualified privilege to the publication of any report or
statement of certain reports and statements.
The section only applies to publication of documents which are of
public concern and public benefit.
In some cases, the defence of qualified privilege cannot be raised if
the defendant failed to accede ‘in a suitable manner’ to a request by the
plaintiff to publish a reasonable letter or statement by way of explanation
or contradiction.
Statements which do not require explanation or contradiction

Fair and accurate reports of proceedings of legislatures, courts, public
inquiries and international organisations anywhere in the world. Fair
and accurate copies of public documents, court notices and documents
of legislatures, governments and international organisations which have
been published anywhere in the world.
Statements which do require explanation or contradiction

This includes, inter alia, fair and accurate reports of public meetings,
general meetings of a UK public company and certain associations. Fair
and accurate reports of notices issued for the information of the public
of legislatures, governments or governmental authorities of Member
States, the European Parliament, the European Commission, international
organisations and conferences and documents of any court of any Member
State or the European Court of Justice, made available by a judge or
officer of the court.
Duty and interest

Statements made by A to B about C where A has a legal, moral or social
duty to communicate to B and which B has a corresponding interest in
receiving or where A has an interest to be protected and B is under a
corresponding legal, moral or social duty to protect that interest.

149

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

The case of Watt v Longsdon (1930) establishes that the reciprocal duty
and interest are essential in all cases of qualified privilege, not only
those in which the allegedly defamatory statement was made in discharge
of a duty. In this case, the plaintiff and defendant were members of the
same firm. Another member of the firm wrote to the defendant, making
defamatory statements about the plaintiff’s morals and behaviour. The
defendant showed the letter to the chairman of the firm and to the
plaintiff’s wife. It was held that publication to the chairman was privileged,
since there was a reciprocal duty to make it and a reciprocal duty to
receive it; but publication to the plaintiff’s wife was not privileged; she
had an interest to receive the statement but the defendant had no duty
to show her the letter.
In Beach v Freeson (1971), a letter by a Member of Parliament to the
Law Society and the Lord Chancellor in which he set out complaints
from one of his constituents concerning the conduct of a firm of solicitors
was held to be protected by qualified privilege.
So, complaints about the conduct of public authorities or of those
with responsibilities to the public are generally protected by qualified
privilege provided they are made in good faith and communicated to a
person with the proper interest in the subject matter.
Statements made in protection of oneself or one’s property

In Osborn v Boulter (1930), a publican complained to the brewers who
supplied him with beer that it was of poor quality. They retorted that
they had heard rumours that the poor quality of the beer was due to the
watering of it by the publican and they published this statement to a
third party. It was held to be privileged.
No generic privilege covering publication of politics

It was held by the House of Lords in Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd
(1999) that there is not a generic qualified privilege defence to libel
proceedings in the publication of a misstatement, concerning political
information, opinion and argument published in a newspaper, as it
would not sufficiently protect an interest in reputation, whether the
publication was subject to qualified privilege was a matter for the judge.
However, the media are entitled to some protection, as in deciding
whether qualified privilege applied, the duty-interest test had to take
into account all the circumstances of the case. The Reynolds case followed
concern after various highly publicised incidents that the law of libel
had a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech. The situation in the UK was in
sharp contrast to the US where the Supreme Court held in New York

150

DEFAMATION

Times v Sullivan (1964) that a public official could not sue for defamation
unless he could prove that the statement had been made in bad faith or
with reckless disregard of whether it was true of false.
The Reynolds case recognises that the public have a general interest
in political matters and the press have a duty to inform them. Before
Reynolds, such a general interest had not been recognised. Lord Nicholls
said that the matters to be taken into account include the following:
• the seriousness of the allegation. The more serious the charge, the
more the public was misinformed and the individual harmed, if the
allegation was not true;
• the nature of the information, and the extent to which the subject
matter was a matter of public concern;
• the source of the information. Some informants had no direct knowledge
of the events. Some had their own axes to grind, or were being paid
for their stories;
• the steps taken to verify the information;
• the status of the information. The allegation might have already been
the subject of an investigation which commanded respect;
• the urgency of the matter. News was often a perishable commodity;
• whether comment was sought from the plaintiff. He might have
information others did not possess or had not disclosed. An approach
to the plaintiff would not always be necessary;
• whether the article contained the gist of the plaintiff’s side of the
story;
• the tone of the article. A newspaper could raise queries or call for an
investigation. It need not adopt allegations as statements of fact;
• the circumstances of the publication, including the timing.
Malice

A plea of unqualified privilege can be rebutted by proof of express malice
and malice in this connection may mean either:
• lack of belief in the truth of the statement;
• use of the privileged occasion for an improper purpose.
Horrocks v Lowe (1974) held that mere carelessness or even honest belief
produced by irrational prejudice, does not amount to malice.
The malice of an agent may make the innocent principal liable in
some cases on the ordinary principles of vicarious liability but the malice

151

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

of the principal cannot do the same for the innocent agent (Egger v
Viscount Chelmsford (1964)).
Remedies
Injunction

Where there is an imminent threat to someone’s reputation, an injunction
may be obtained in order to prevent the publication of defamatory material.
Damages
Nominal damages

These are awarded where the case has been proved but the plaintiff has
suffered very little damage.
Contemptuous damages

These are awarded where the plaintiff has been technically successful
but the claim is without merit, for example, Plato v Speidel Films (1961).
Exemplary damages

These can be awarded where the defendant has calculated that even
after paying out damages and costs he will still make a profit if he
commits the tort, for example, by defaming someone but making a profit
through increased circulation of his newspaper (Cassell & Co v Broome
(1972)).
Excessive damages

The level of damages in defamation cases are set by juries who seem to
set the awards at a disproportionately high level, particularly in comparison
to personal injury cases. Until recently, the Court of Appeal could not
reduce high awards of damages in libel cases unless the jury had been
misdirected. The situation changed with the introduction of s 8 of the
Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. The Court of Appeal can now
substitute a fresh award if the original award is ‘excessive or inadequate’.
In Sutcliffe v Pressdram Ltd (1990), the plaintiff who is the wife of a
serial killer was awarded £600,000 damages by a jury after Private Eye
alleged that she had sold her story. On appeal, damages were reduced
as they wrongly contained an element of exemplary damages.
A new approach was used in Rantzen v Mirror Group Newspapers (1993)
by using a combination of s 8 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990
and Art 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The plaintiff
had been awarded £250,000 in damages. The defendants claimed that
the size of the award inhibited their right to free speech. The Court of
Appeal said that ‘excessive’ damages had to be interpreted in the light

152

DEFAMATION

of Art 10 which only allows those restrictions on free speech which are
‘necessary’. The Convention was said to underlie common law principles
relating to free speech. The damages awarded should be proportionate
to the damage suffered and were therefore reduced to £110,000.
The European Court of Human Rights ruled that libel damages of
£1.5 million were a violation of Art 10 of the European Convention on
Human Rights in Tolstoy Miloslavsky v UK (1995). It was found that judicial
control at the trial and on appeal, did not offer adequate and effective
safeguards against a disproportionately large award. At the relevant
time, an award could only be overturned if it was so unreasonable that
it could only be arrived at capriciously, unconscionably or irrationally.
The combination of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 and principles
of free expression now mean that awards can be overturned on appeal,
on the grounds that they are excessive.
Judicial control over the awards made by juries has been further
strengthened by the Defamation Act 1996 (see below) and the case of
John v MGN Ltd (1995), as judges can now give guidance as to the amount
of compensation. Sir Thomas Bingham MR (as he then was) also said in
that case that although Art 10 of the European Convention on Human
Rights was not part of English law there was no conflict or discrepancy
between that and the common law.
The new guidelines were used in Kiam v Neill (1996). In that case, an
award of £45,000 to a businessman who had allegations of defaulting
on a loan and insolvency made against him was not excessive. The Court
of Appeal held that the jury could take into account the prominence of
the plaintiff’s reputation, the fact that it struck at the core of his life’s
achievement and that it had a prolonged and significant effect on him
personally. The extent of publication is also relevant.
The Defamation Act 1996 aims to create a new fast track for libel cases,
by having smaller cases handled summarily by judges alone. Plaintiffs
are able to go straight to a judge for a correction. Damages of up to
£10,000 can be awarded.
There are new defences of offers of amends to defendants that did
not intend to defame and are willing to pay damages assessed by a judge
and to publish an appropriate correction and apology.

153

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Fast track procedure
Sections 8–10 of the Defamation Act 1996 introduce new powers for the
court to dispose summarily of the plaintiff’s claim. The purpose of the
procedure is to simplify, expedite and reduce the costs of the simpler
defamation claims.
Section 8 gives the judge the power to dismiss the case summarily.
The claim can be dismissed if it has no realistic prospect of success and
there is no reason why it should be tried. The plaintiff can be given
judgment and summary relief if there is no defence with a reasonable
prospect of success and there is no reason why it should be tried.
Section 9 sets out summary relief as follows:
• a declaration that the statement was false and defamatory;
• an order that the defendant publish a suitable correction and apology;
• damages not exceeding £10,000; an order restraining the defendant
from publishing or further publishing the matter complained of.
The content of any correction and apology, and the manner of publication
is for the parties to agree but in the absence of agreement the court may
give directions. This has led to criticisms that the procedure enters into
the area of editorial responsibility.
Doubt has been cast on whether the fast track procedure can fulfil its
aims of expediting and simplifying procedure. It potentially adds a new
stage to every defamation trial, there is little guidance as to how judges
are to decide cases under this procedure and there will still be areas of
conflict between the parties, such as the suitability of the procedure to
the case in question and points of evidence. Legal aid is not available
for the procedure, although the Lord Chancellor has said that he is
considering it.

8 General Defences
You should be familiar with the following areas:
•
•
•
•
•

contributory negligence
consent/volenti non fit injuria
ex tupi causa non oritur actio
inevitable accident
mistake

So far, we have been primarily concerned with what a plaintiff has to
prove in order to establish the existence of a tort. This would be a
convenient point to consider certain defences which may be raised by
the defendant, who while admitting the behaviour complained of (which
would otherwise constitute a tort), then seeks to adduce in evidence
additional facts which will excuse what he has done. So, the burden of
proving the facts to establish the defence rests on the defendant.

Contributory negligence
Position at common law
At common law, it was a complete defence if the defendant proved that
the plaintiff had been guilty of contributory negligence. In Butterfield v
Forrester (1809), the defendant negligently left a pole lying across the
road. The plaintiff was injured when he collided with the pole when
riding along the road. Although the defendant had been negligent, he
escaped liability since the plaintiff would have avoided the accident if
he had not been riding so fast.
Last opportunity

This resulted in undue hardship to the plaintiff and so to mitigate its
harshness the courts developed the rule of ‘last opportunity’ which
meant that whoever was negligent last in time was treated as the sole
cause of the damage on the basis that they had been the last one to have

155

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

the opportunity to avoid the accident. The rule was applied in Davies v
Mann (1842). The plaintiff tied the feet of his donkey and negligently
left him on the highway. The defendant who was driving his wagon
faster than necessary collided with, and killed, the donkey. The defendant
was liable. If he had been driving at the correct speed, he would have
avoided the donkey, so he had the last opportunity to avoid the accident.
Furthermore, if but for the defendant’s negligence he would have
had the last opportunity he was again treated as if he had the last
opportunity and was liable for the full loss (British Columbia Electric
Railway Co Ltd v Loach (1916)).
Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945
This linear sequential approach to liability was most difficult to apply
in cases where events occurred simultaneously.
The problems led to the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act
1945, which introduced apportionment of damages for accidents occurring
on land. It is now possible for the courts to reduce the damages awarded
against the defendant to the extent to which the plaintiff was contributorily
negligent. It was held by the Court of Appeal in Pitts v Hunt (1991) that
damages can never be reduced by 100% and, therefore, contributory
negligence can only be a partial defence.
Scope of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945
Under s 4 of the Act, fault means ‘negligence, breach of statutory duty
or other act or omission which gives rise to liability in tort’. Thus, the
Act applies to nuisance and Rylands v Fletcher as well as negligence.
There is conflicting authority as to whether the rule applies to trespass
to the person, for example, Salmond and Heuston believe it does not
apply and Brazier in Street on Torts believes it does. It does not apply to
trespass to goods or conversion by virtue of s 11 of the Torts (Interference
with Goods) Act 1977.
In order to establish and prove contributory negligence, the defendant
must plead and prove:
• that the plaintiff’s injury results from the risk which the plaintiff’s
negligence exposed him;
• that the plaintiff’s negligence contributed to his injury;
• that there was fault or negligence on the part of the plaintiff.

156

GENERAL DEFENCES

Plaintiff’s negligence contributed to his injury
It is not necessary to show that the plaintiff owes the defendant a duty
of care, merely that the plaintiff has contributed to the injury and not
necessarily the cause of the accident. So, in OÕConnell v Jackson (1972),
there was a 15% reduction in the damages awarded to a motorcyclist
because of his failure to wear a crash helmet. Similarly, in Froom v Butcher
(1975), there was a 25% reduction to a driver for failure to wear a seatbelt,
as the injury could have been completely avoided by wearing the seat
belt but if wearing a seat belt would have reduced the severity of the
injuries then damages would have been reduced by 15%.
Other examples of the plaintiff having contributed to the injury include
the failure of a motorcyclist to fasten the chin strap of a crash helmet
(Capps v Miller (1989)); accepting a lift in a car, knowing that the driver
is drunk (Owens v Brimmell (1977)), although the burden is on the defendant
to show that the plaintiff knew that the defendant was unfit to drive
(Limbrick v French (1993)); asking a much younger inexperienced driver
to drive a car when the driver has never driven a powerful, automatic
car before (Donelan v Donelan (1993)); crossing a pelican crossing when
the pedestrian light is red (Fitzgerald v Lane (1989)) and injured while
trespassing as a result of criminal activities (Revill v Newbery (1996)). In
Commissioner of the Police for the Metropolis v Reeves (1999), the House of
Lords held that a prisoner who hanged himself in police custody had
been contributorily negligent in relation to his own death.
Plaintiff’s injury results from the risk which he exposed
himself
In Jones v Livox Quarries Ltd (1952), the plaintiff was riding on the back
of the defendant’s vehicle contrary to instructions. A vehicle collided
into the back, injuring the plaintiff. He argued, unsuccessfully, that he
had exposed himself to the risk of falling off, not to a collision.
The standard of care
This is the same standard of care as that in negligence per Lord Denning
in Jones v Livox Quarries:
A person is guilty of contributory negligence if he ought reasonably
to have foreseen that, if he did not act as a reasonable, prudent man,
he might hurt himself and in his reckoning he must take into account
the possibility of others being careless.

157

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

In practice, though the courts seem to demand less of plaintiffs than
defendants.
Children

Denning LJ in Gough v Thorne (1966) said that a very young child could
not be contributorily negligent. However, the general test seems to be
what degree of care an infant of a particular age can reasonably be
expected to take for his own safety (Yachuk v Oliver Blais Co Ltd (1949)).
Consequently, a 12 year old girl was contributorily negligent in Armstrong
v Cotterell (1993), as a child of that age is expected to know the basic
elements of the Highway Code.
It was held in Oliver v Birmingham and Midland Omnibus Co Ltd (1933)
that, where a child is under the control of an adult, negligence on the
part of the adult is not imputed to the child.
Accidents at work

The purpose of such statutory regulations as the Factories Acts is to
ensure the safety standards in workplaces and to protect workers from
their own carelessness.
This being the purpose behind such regulations in order to ensure
that their purpose is not defeated by finding contributory negligence,
the courts tend to be less willing to make a finding of contributory
negligence in these cases (see Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Colleries
Ltd (1940)).
This does not mean that a workman can never be guilty of contributory
negligence. In Jayes v IMI (Kynoch) Ltd (1985), a workman who put his
hand into a piece of moving machinery had his damages reduced by
100%, even though the employer was in breach of his statutory duty to
fence the machinery. It should be noted that this case was heard prior
to Pitts v Hunt (1990) and damages can now never be reduced by 100%.
Emergency

An emergency is a special situation in which a person’s reactions may,
with hindsight, be regarded as negligent. The law takes account of this
and provided the plaintiff has acted reasonably he will not be held to
have been contributorily negligent (see Jones v Boyce (1816)).

158

GENERAL DEFENCES

Consent/volenti non fit injuria
There is considerable confusion between these two concepts. Consent
is used to describe the defence that may be used when sued for committing
an intentional tort.
Volenti non fit injuria is the appropriate term where the plaintiff alleges
negligence/strict liability tort, that is, an unintentional tort, which claims
the defendant’s voluntary assumption of the risk involved. However,
the general principles applying to both concepts are the same but it is
important to bear in mind the stature of the tort concerned.
The defence of consent was found to be available to a defendant who
clamped the plaintiff’s car in Arthur v Anker (1995). However, certain
conditions had to be satisfied before the defence would arise. There
would have to be a notice that a vehicle parked without lawful authority
would be clamped and released on payment of a fee. The release fee
would have to be reasonable. The vehicle would have to be released
without delay, once the owner had offered to pay and there would have
to be means by which the owner could communicate his offer of payment.
It was said by Roch LJ in Vine v Waltham Forest LBC (2000) that, to
show that the owner of a wheel clamped car had consented to or willingly
assumed the risk, it had to be established that he was aware of the
consequences of his parking his car so that it trespassed on the land of
another.
Mere knowledge does not imply consent
In the case of Smith v Baker and Sons (1891), the plaintiff was an employee
of the defendants and was employed in drilling holes and rock cutting
and was aware of the danger of a crane continually swinging over his
head. A stone fell out of the crane and injured him. He brought an action
in negligence and volenti non fit injuria was pleaded.
It was held that mere knowledge of the risk was not enough; it had
to be shown that the plaintiff had consented to the particular thing being
done which would involve the risk and consented to take that risk upon
himself.
The question in Dann v Hamilton (1939) was whether a plaintiff who
accepted a lift from a drunk driver who was obviously inebriated could
be taken to have assumed the risk of injury. It was held that volenti did
not apply, unless the drunkenness was so extreme and so glaring that
accepting lift was equivalent to ‘walking on the edge of an unfenced
cliff’.

159

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Under s 149 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, defendants are prevented
from relying on the volenti defence where a passenger sues a driver in
circumstances where, under the Act, insurance is compulsory. It does
not apply where there is no requirement of compulsory insurance under
the Act, for example, an aeroplane. In Morris v Murray (1990), two men
involved in a drinking session took a plane on a flight. The plane crashed
but the plaintiff passenger was held to be volens as he must have known
the state the pilot was in.
To be effective consent must be freely given
Normally, as already shown by in Smith v Baker and Sons, an employee
will rarely be held to be volens but there are exceptional cases such as
ICI v Shatwell (1965). The plaintiff and his brother disregarded the
instructions of their employer and were also in breach of statutory safety
regulations and chose to test certain detonators without seeking the
necessary precautions. The plaintiff was injured in the subsequent
explosion. The plaintiff’s action in both negligence and breach of statutory
duty failed because of volenti non fit injuria. This is an unusual case,
however, and volens will not normally arise out of an employee’s ordinary
duties.
Rescue cases
The law is reluctant to apply volenti to rescue situations because, to do
so, would negative the duty of care owed to the plaintiff.
In Haynes v Harwood (1935), a two horse van was left unattended in
the street. A boy threw a stone, the horses ran off and threatened a woman
and children. A policeman intercepted and stopped the horses but was
injured. It was held that the volenti defence did not apply. Volenti will
apply where there is no real risk of danger and there is not a genuine
emergency (Cutler v United Dairies (London) Ltd (1933)).
Sporting events
In Smolden v Whitworth (1997), a colts rugby player sued the referee in
negligence for failing to control the scrum properly. The plaintiff suffered
a broken back when the scrum collapsed. It was held that the player had
consented to the ordinary incidents of the game. He cannot be said to
have consented to the breach of duty of an official whose job was to
enforce the rules.

160

GENERAL DEFENCES

In McCord v Swansea City AFC (1997), it was held that recklessness
was not required to be shown after a clear foul which was outside the
laws of the game as there is no volens to such acts.
The plaintiff in Watson v British Board of Boxing Control (1999) suffered
a sub-dural haemorrhage as a result of a blow to the head during a
boxing match. The defendant had failed to provide appropriate medical
assistance, in particular resuscitation equipment and a person qualified
to use such equipment at the ringside. It was held that, although the
plaintiff had consented to the risk of injury at the hands of his opponent,
he had not consented to the risk of injury flowing from the defendant’s
failure to ensure proper safety arrangements.

Illegal acts
A person who is engaged in an illegal act at the time he is injured may
be precluded from a civil claim by the maxim ex turpi causa non oritur
actio (bad people get less).
A distinction was made by Asquith LJ in National Coal Board v England
between two different types of situation:
• the case of two burglars on their way to commit a burglary and while
proceeding one picks the other’s pocket; and
• where they have agreed to open a safe by means of high explosive
and one negligently handles the explosive charge injuring the other.
In the first situation, he thought that there would be liability in tort but
not in the second. The idea being that where the illegality is incidental
to the cause of action in tort then recovery in tort may still be allowed.
It was held in Ashton v Turner (1980) that one participant in a burglary
could not succeed against his fellow participant who crashed the car
while driving away at high speed from the scene of the crime.
In the case of Pitts v Hunt (1990), the plaintiff was a pillion passenger
on a motorcycle. Both the plaintiff and the defendant who was riding
the motorcycle were drunk. The plaintiff also knew that the defendant
was unlicensed and uninsured. The defendant carelessly crashed the
motorcycle, killing himself and injuring the plaintiff. Due to s 149 of the
Road Traffic Act 1988, the defence of volenti did not apply. Nevertheless,
the plaintiff was found to be ex turpi. The majority of the Court of Appeal
held that because of the joint illegal activity it was impossible to determine
the standard of care.

161

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Most cases have not followed this standard of care test but have
instead used a test based on whether it would be an affront to public
conscience to compensate the plaintiff.
Recently, in the case of Revill v Newbery (1995), it was held that the
rule did not apply in a claim for personal injuries where the plaintiff
was a trespasser engaged in criminal activities and the defendant had
shot the plaintiff. The defendant was found to have acted negligently
and to have denied the plaintiff, who had been contributorily negligent,
any compensation would have effectively made him an outlaw. The case
was distinguished from a ‘joint criminal enterprise’ such as Pitts v Hunt.
Evans LJ held that it is one thing to deny a plaintiff any fruits from his
illegal conduct but different and more far-reaching to deprive him of
compensation for injury which he had suffered and which he was
otherwise entitled to recover at law.
It was held in Cross v Kirkby (2000) that, in assault and battery, a plea
of ex turpi causa non oritur actio could succeed if the defendant’s actions
were inextricably linked to the claimant’s unlawful conduct. The plaintiff
had been engaged in hunt sabotage on the defendant’s land. The plaintiff’s
partner had bitten the defendant when he had been escorting her from
his land. The plaintiff then started attacking the defendant. The plaintiff
armed himself with a baseball bat and struck the defendant. The defendant
started to walk away but to ward off further blows grappled with the
plaintiff. Wrestling the bat from him, the defendant struck the plaintiff,
fracturing his skull. It was held that the plaintiff’s injury originated and
arose from his own criminal conduct and the defendant could rely on
the ex turpi causa defence.
The defence of illegality was invoked on grounds of public policy in
Clunis v Camden and Islington HA (1998). The plaintiff who suffered from
a mental illness attacked and killed a stranger, had sued his health
authority in negligence, as they had released him prematurely.
Immoral conduct
Ex turpi applies not only to criminal conduct but can also apply to immoral
conduct, as well. In Kirkham v Chief Constable of the Greater Manchester
Police (1990), it was said that suicide committed by someone ‘wholly
sane’ would be ex turpi, but in that particular case it did not apply, as
there was grave mental instability.

162

GENERAL DEFENCES

Mistake
Mistake as to law or to fact, is not a general defence. Mistake is not a
defence to an intentional tort such as trespass or conversion, however,
reasonable.

Inevitable accident
This used to be a defence in trespass but now liability in trespass depends
upon proof of intention. However, in negligence, if it can be shown that
the accident could not have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable
care, then that amounts to a claim that the behaviour was not negligent.

Statutory authority
A statute may authorise what would otherwise be a tort and an injured
party will have no remedy save for that provided by statute. Statutes
often confer powers to act on public and other authorities. Such power
will not in general be a defence to a claim in tort.

Limitation of actions
In actions at common law, there is no limitation period. The rules on
limitation are entirely statutory and are now contained in the Limitation
Act 1980.
The basic rule is that an action cannot be brought more than six years
from the date the cause of action accrued (s 2 of the Limitation Act 1980).
There are four situations in which different rules apply.
Actions for personal injury and death

In actions for personal injuries, the basic limitation period is three years
from either the date on which the cause of action accrued or the date of
the plaintiff’s knowledge whichever is later (s 11(4) of the Limitation
Act 1980). The court has a wide discretion to disregard this time limit
and permit the action to proceed by virtue of s 33 of the Limitation Act
1980.
It was held by the House of Lords in Stubbings v Webb (1993) that s 11
of the Limitation Act 1980 only applies to personal injuries arising from
negligence, nuisance or breach of a duty of care. Therefore, the limitation

163

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

period for personal injuries caused by assault was six years from the
date cause of action accrued.
The cause of action accrues when the plaintiff suffers actionable damage
irrespective of the plaintiff’s knowledge of the damage (Cartledge v Jopling
& Sons Ltd (1963)). But, the ‘date of knowledge’ is defined in s 15 of the
Limitation Act 1980. The plaintiff has knowledge of the cause of action
when he first has knowledge of the following facts:
• that the injury was significant; and
• that the injury was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission
which is alleged to constitute negligence, nuisance or breach of duty;
and
• the identity of the defendant; and
• if it is alleged that the act or omission was that of a person other than
the defendant, the identity of that person and the additional facts
supporting the bringing of an action against the defendant.
An injury is ‘significant’ if it would justify proceedings against a defendant
who did not dispute liability and was able to satisfy the judgment.
Knowledge includes ‘constructive knowledge’, that is, knowledge a
person might reasonably have been expected to acquire.
After a major operation, the date of knowledge for the purposes of
s 11 of the Limitation Act 1980 occurs as soon as the plaintiff has had
time to overcome the shock of the injury, take stock of his disability and
seek advice (Forbes v Wandsworth HA (1996)).
With regard to the discretion given by s 33, the court will have regard
to all the circumstances and the exercise of the discretion is something
of a lottery. The discretion was held to be unfettered in Firman v Ellis
(1978).
By s 33(3), the court must have regard to particular aspects of the
matter, for example, the length and reasons for the delay; the defendant’s
conduct; the effect of delay on the evidence; the plaintiff’s conduct, etc.
In deciding whether to exercise its discretion to disapply the three
year rule under s 33 of the Limitation Act 1980, the court should apply
a subjective rather than an objective test as to the reasons for the plaintiff’s
delay in instituting proceedings (Coad v Cornwall and Isles of Scilly HA
(1996)).
A subjective test was again applied in Spargo v North Essex DHA (1997).

164

GENERAL DEFENCES

Latent damage

Where damage is latent, the plaintiff will be unaware that the damage
has actually occurred. As a result, the cause of action may accrue and
become statute barred before the plaintiff even knows about the damage
or his right to sue.
In Cartledge v E Jopling & Sons Ltd (1963), the plaintiff contracted
pneumoconiosis from the inhalation of dust over a long period of working
in a particular environment. The damage to the lungs was latent and
the plaintiff was unaware of it.
The House of Lords held that the cause of action accrued when
significant damage to the lungs occurred and it was irrelevant that the
plaintiff knew of the damage or not. As a result of this decision, the law
of limitation was changed by statute in relation to personal injuries.
This left the problem of what to do about the defective buildings.
Various tests for the commencement of the limitation period were
developed. For example, some felt the limitation period should begin
with the date of construction; others felt that time should run when the
plaintiff discovered the damage or ought reasonably to have done so.
However, the case of Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd v Oscar Fabier and
Partners (1983) held the action accrued and therefore the limitation period
commenced when physical damage to the building actually occurred,
regardless of whether it could be discovered by the plaintiff. A distinction
is made between structural fault and the defect arising from it. The Pirelli
case maintains that the action accrues at the time the physical damage
occurs.
Pirelli has caused one or two problems. The Latent Damage Act 1986
tries to redress them. It introduced a special extension of the limitation
period in respect of latent damage (other than physical injury) and it
gives the plaintiff three years from the date on which he discovered
significant damage. This amends the Limitation Act 1980 accordingly.
All claims are subject to an absolute bar for claims for 15 years from the
date of the defendant’s negligence.
The Latent Damage Act 1986 is an attempt to redress the balance
between the plaintiff and the defendant in latent or postponed damage
cases.
The Court of Appeal in Hallam-Eames v Merrett (1995) held that where
a plaintiff is relying on the extended limitation period provided by the
Latent Damage Act 1986, he was required to have knowledge of those
facts which were causally relevant for the purposes of the allegation of
negligence.

165

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Fraudulent concealment of a right of action

Where the defendant has deliberately concealed from the plaintiff the
facts of a tort, the period of limitation does not commence until the
plaintiff has discovered the fraud or could with reasonable diligence
have done so.
Therefore, in Kitchen v Royal Air Force Association (1958), a failure by
solicitors to inform the plaintiff of an offer of £100 by potential defendants
because that might reveal their own negligence at an earlier stage,
constituted deliberate concealment.
Persons under a disability

Time does not run against an infant, or a person of unsound mind, until
he ceases to be under a disability or dies, whichever occurs. However, if
the plaintiff was not under a disability when the action accrued but
subsequently becomes of unsound mind this will not prevent time from
running.

166

9 Remedies
You should be familiar with the following areas:
• aims of compensation
• types of damage
• structured settlements, provisional damages, interim
damages
• injunctions
• death in relation to tort

In considering remedies, it should be remembered that tort compensation
is not the principal form of compensation. In tort, the plaintiff’s chances
of receiving adequate compensation will depend on whether he can
prove the defendant was at fault and whether the defendant has adequate
resources to compensate the plaintiff. It should be remembered that the
tort system interlinks with other compensation systems. It is no coincidence
that a high proportion of tort damages are in respect of road accidents,
industrial accidents and medical mishaps. The insurance system works
behind the scenes to ensure that the plaintiff is adequately compensated
in these types of cases. There is also an interaction between the tort
system and other forms of compensation such as social security, criminal
injuries compensation and workmen’s compensation.

Aims of compensation
The aim of tort compensation is to restore the plaintiff to the position
he would have been in had the tort not been committed (Livingstone v
Rawyards Coal Co (1880)).
It has been argued that the compensation system is based on the wrong
principles. The plaintiff is compensated for what he has actually lost. The
defendant is therefore liable for a greater amount of damages if he injures

167

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

a high earning plaintiff as opposed to a low earning plaintiff. It has been
said that damages should be based on what the plaintiff needs rather than
on what he has lost. This is particularly relevant in cases of severe injury.
Further criticisms are based on the guesswork involved in calculating
future loss and that compensation depends on the fault principle. Both
of these points are considered in greater depth below.

Single action and lump sum
A plaintiff can only bring one action in respect of a single wrong. He
cannot maintain a second action based on the same facts merely because
the damage turns out to be more extensive than was anticipated. He can
recover damages once only and the cause of the action is extinguished
by the action. The authority for this is Fetter v Beale (1699). A plaintiff
failed in his claim for further damages after his medical condition
deteriorated following his first award of damages.
However, if one and the same act violates two rights which are accorded
separate protection by the law of torts, then there are two separate causes
of action; the prosecution of one will not bar proceedings in respect of
the other. So, in Brunsden v Humphrey (1884), a cab driven by the plaintiff
collided with the defendant’s van through the negligent driving of the
defendant’s servant. In county court proceedings, the plaintiff recovered
compensation for damage to his cab. He then brought a second action
in the High Court for personal injuries sustained by him in the same
collision and the Court of Appeal held that this action was not barred
by an earlier one.
Damages are assessed once and for all and can be awarded in the
form of a lump sum or, since 1989, it has been possible to receive a
structured settlement, whereby the damages are divided into a lump
sum and periodic payments. This principle causes difficulties where
loss in the future is uncertain. In personal injury actions, the plaintiff’s
medical condition may become much worse or much better than expected.
In the words of Lord Scarman in Lim Poh Choo v Camden and Islington
AHA (1980):
Knowledge of the future being denied to mankind, so much of the
award as is attributed to future loss and suffering will almost surely
be wrong. There is only one certainty: the future will prove the award
to be either too high or too low.

168

REMEDIES

Disadvantages of lump sum system

A number of criticisms have been made of the lump sum system. These
can be identified as follows.
Lump sums do not fulfil the aims of tort compensation

The aim of tort damages is to place the defendant in the position he would
have been in, if the tort had not been committed. A lump sum carries with
it the responsibility of investment, to ensure future income from the lump
sum. If the plaintiff was to be truly compensated for his loss, then he would
receive a regular income in place of his lost earnings.
Lump sums are easily dissipated

There is nothing preventing the plaintiff from spending the lump sum,
before the end of the period for which it was intended that the plaintiff
would be compensated for. This would leave the plaintiff making a claim
against the Welfare State and be doubly compensated for a single injury.
Lump sums are expensive, delay payment and cause stress

As lump sums are a once and for all system of compensation, they tend
to encourage delay prior to settlement. There is every incentive to wait
until the plaintiff’s condition has stabilised, as much as possible, to
ensure that the quantum of damages reflects the plaintiff’s loss as closely
as possible. Because an assessment of the plaintiff’s future condition
involves guesswork, reliance is placed on expert reports, which frequently
conflict and this increases delay and costs. There is little incentive for
the defendant to settle early. The plaintiff may be in receipt of welfare
payments which may pressurise him into settling early and for too little.
A medical condition termed ‘compensation neurosis’ has been identified,
whereby the plaintiff’s condition fails to improve pending the outcome
of the case. In addition, once the case has been settled, the plaintiff has
to manage a sum which is probably greater than any other he has had
to deal with in his life and also ensure that it lasts for the rest of his life.
Lump sums are based on guesswork

A number of projections have to be made when assessing the plaintiff’s
loss under the lump sum system, for example, his future condition, his
future earning prospects, his promotion prospects prior to the accident,
etc. A lump sum system does not allow for a change in circumstance,
whereas a system of periodic payments can allow for occasional review.

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Types of damage
Nominal damages

Nominal damages are awarded where the plaintiff has proved his case
but has suffered no loss (Constantine v Imperial Hotels Ltd (1944)). The
plaintiff will only be awarded a small amount of money. Nominal damage
can only be awarded for those torts which are actionable per se.
Contemptuous damages

Contemptuous damages are awarded where the action is technically
successful but is without merit and the action should not have been
brought. The amount of damages is usually the smallest coin in the
realm. The judge will normally order the plaintiff to pay his own costs
and may even order him to pay the defendant’s costs as well.
Aggravated damages

Aggravated damages are compensatory. They are awarded where the
plaintiff has suffered more than can reasonably be expected in the
situation. They will be awarded where the plaintiff’s proper feelings of
dignity and pride have been injured (Jolliffe v Willmett & Co (1971)). They
have also been awarded where the tort was committed in a malicious,
insulting or oppressive manner (Broome v Cassell & Co Ltd (1972)). They
will not be awarded in cases of personal injury where the tort was
committed in a way than was more painful than necessary as a higher
award for pain and suffering will reflect this (Kralj v McGrath (1986); AB
v South West Water Services Ltd (1993)).
The Law Commission in its 1997 report, Aggravated, Exemplary and
Restitutionary Damages, recommended that aggravated damages should
be re-named ‘damages for mental distress’ to make it clear that they are
compensatory.
Exemplary damages

Exemplary damages are intended to be punitive and can therefore be
distinguished from aggravated damages which are compensatory. They
take the form of an additional award on top of the compensatory award.
They are an exception to the rule that the aim of damages in tort is to
compensate. They are unpopular with judges as they confuse the aims
of the criminal and civil law and it is also thought that it is undesirable
to punish a defendant without the safeguards inherent in the criminal
law. By contrast, it has been argued most notably by Lord Wilberforce
in Broome v Cassell & Co Ltd (1972) that tort has a deterrent function in
addition to a compensatory function and that exemplary damages are

170

REMEDIES

therefore a legitimate part of the compensation system. Nevertheless,
a restrictive approach has been taken and it was held in Rookes v Barnard
(1964) that exemplary damages could only be awarded in three situations:
• oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by servants of
government. The term ‘servants of the government’ includes police
officers and also local and central government officials. It was held
in AB v South West Water Services Ltd (1993) that publicly owned utilities
which provide a monopoly service are outside the category. A man
who had been seriously assaulted by police officers was entitled to
substantial exemplary damages and these damages were not reduced
on the grounds of his serious previous convictions in Treadaway v
Chief Constable of West Midlands (1994);
• where the defendant’s conduct has been calculated to make a profit
for himself which exceeds the compensation payable. In Broome v
Cassell & Co Ltd (1972), the defendants published a book which they
knew contained defamatory statements about the plaintiff. They
believed that the increased profits from the sale would exceed any
award of damages. Compensatory damages of £15,000 were awarded
and an additional £25,000 exemplary damages. In AB v South West
Water Services Ltd (1993), it was held that covering up the existence
of a tort did not come within this category;
• where statute authorises the award of exemplary damages.
In AB v South West Water Services Ltd (1993), it was held by the Court of
Appeal that exemplary damages could not be awarded in negligence,
deceit, breach of statutory duty or public nuisance. This reasoning was
based on Rookes v Barnard (1964). The House of Lords had attempted to
limit exemplary damages in that case and therefore it is not possible to
award such damages unless they were available for that type of tort
prior to 1964. Consequently, it was held in Kuddus v Chief Constable of
Leicestershire (2000) that misfeasance in public office was not a tort for
which exemplary damages would have been awarded before 1964 and
did not fall within the category of causes of action to which the House
of Lords in Rookes v Barnard (1964) had limited the award of exemplary
damages.
The Court of Appeal laid down guidelines to juries for the award of
exemplary damages against the police in Thompson v Commissioner of
Police of the Metropolis (1998). It is unlikely to be less than £5,000 and
might be as much as £25,000 where an officer of the rank of superintendent
or above is involved.

171

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

The Law Commission in its 1997 report, Aggravated, Exemplary and
Restitutionary Damages, recommended that exemplary damages should
be re-named ‘punitive damages’. A judge, as opposed to a jury, should
recommend whether they are awardable and their amount. Defendants
should be liable to pay them for any tort or equitable wrong or a civil
wrong arising under statute in any case where the defendant’s behaviour
in committing the wrong or after it has been committed deliberately or
outrageously disregarded the plaintiff’s rights.
General and special damages

There are two meanings to these terms. First, general damages can mean
the damage that is presumed to flow from torts which are actionable per
se, for example, trespass and special damage is the damage the plaintiff
must prove where damage is an element of the tort, for example, negligence.
The second and most common meaning is that general damages are
those which cannot be calculated precisely, whereas special damages
are those which can be calculated precisely at the date of trial.
Damages in personal injury actions

A plaintiff who suffers injuries incurs two types of loss. Pecuniary loss,
for example, loss of earnings, expenses, etc, and non-pecuniary loss, for
example, pain and suffering, loss of a limb. The main heads of damage
are as follows.
Medical and other expenses

Under s 2(4) of the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948, the plaintiff
may incur private medical expenses and recover the same, despite the
availability of the NHS. The Pearson Commission recommended that
private medical expenses should only be recoverable where it was
reasonable that they should be incurred on medical grounds but this
proposal has not been implemented.
Section 5 of the Administration of Justice Act 1982 provides that where
an injured person makes a saving by being maintained at public expense
in a hospital, nursing home or other institution, then these savings must
be set off against his loss of income. The Road Traffic (NHS Charges)
Act 1999 enables NHS hospitals to recover the cost of treating accident
victims from defendants’ insurers.
If the plaintiff has to change to special accommodation as a result of
his injuries, then the additional annual cost over ordinary accommodation
is recoverable. The cost of adapting accommodation or a car to special
needs is also recoverable. The capital cost of special accommodation or
car is not recoverable as it is an asset which belongs to the plaintiff.

172

REMEDIES

An example of an additional expense incurred as a result of a tort is
contained in Jones v Jones (1984). The plaintiff’s injuries led to the breakdown
of his marriage. The Court of Appeal held that the extra cost to the
plaintiff of having to finance two homes instead of one was, in principle,
recoverable. This case has been criticised on the basis that it is not felt
that marriage breakdown is really foreseeable. By contrast, it was held
in Pritchard v JH Cobden Ltd (1987) that the cost of a marriage breakdown
caused by injuries were not recoverable either because it was too remote
or on grounds that it was contrary to public policy.
In Donnelly v Joyce (1974), the plaintiff’s loss included the cost incurred
by a third party. For example, where a relative or friend provides nursing
assistance or financial assistance, then this can be catered for in the
plaintiff’s claim. Where a relative has given up work, then the loss of
earnings will be recoverable provided they do not exceed the commercial
cost of nursing care (Housecroft v Burnett (1986)).
It was held by the House of Lords in McFarlane v Tayside Health Board
(1999) that the parents of a healthy child, who was born after her father
had undergone a vasectomy operation and had been told that he was
no longer fertile, were not entitled to damages in respect of the costs of
caring for and bringing up the child. It was thought to be too difficult
to arrive at a reliable figure, as child-rearing confers benefits as well as
costs and as the valuation would be made early there was no way of
knowing how the child would turn out.
In Briody v St Helens and Knowsley HA (2000), it was held to be contrary
to public policy to award damages to enable a claimant, who was unable
to have children as a result of the defendants’ negligence, to enter into
a commercial surrogacy agreement abroad, when such an agreement
would be unlawful in the UK.
Loss of earnings

This can be divided into actual loss and future loss.
Actual loss runs from the date of the accident to the date of assessment
(settlement or trial). It is not permissible to profit from loss of earnings,
so income tax and social security contributions must be deducted in
order to ascertain the net loss (BTC v Gourley (1956)). Loss of perquisites,
for example, a company car are also taken into account.
Future loss is speculative and relates to losses the plaintiff will suffer
after the date of assessment.
Section 10 of the Civil Evidence Act 1995 allows actuarial tables to be
admissible in evidence to ‘assess general damages for future pecuniary
loss’. Although this is designed to reduce some of the problems associated

173

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

with guesswork, it should be remembered that actuarial tables are
compiled with life insurance and not compensation in mind.
First, it is necessary to calculate the net loss of earnings, this is known
as the multiplicand. Tax and social security contributions are deducted
from the plaintiff’s earnings to arrive at the net figure. The multiplicand
is adjusted to take account of future promotion prospects.
The multiplicand is multiplied by an appropriate multiplier up to a
maximum of 18. In practice, the multiplier is rarely this high as it is
discounted to take account of future uncertainties and also accelerated
receipt. A return on capital invested is taken as 4.5% and the sum awarded
which is invested should provide for lost earnings, the plaintiff being
expected to live off the investment income and part of the capital. Future
inflation is not taken into account as that should be covered by shrewd
investment. In cases of very large awards, the House of Lords held in
Hodgson v Trapp (1988) that the multiplier could not be increased to reflect
the fact that the plaintiff would be paying tax at higher tax levels.
There has been a flurry of recent case law concerning the multiplier.
At first instance, in Wells v Wells (1995); Thomas v Brighton HA (1995) and
Page v Sheerness Steel Co plc (1995), the judge fixed the multiplier by
reference to the return on index-linked government securities at 3% a
year. These are safe investments, involving minimum risk. The effect
was to make the multiplier significantly higher and the damages were
greatly increased. All three cases were heard together in the Court of
Appeal in 1996 where it was held that the assumption in large awards
was that the plaintiff would seek advice on how to manage the money.
A basket of investment would include a substantial proportion of riskier
equities as well as index linked government securities. Consequently,
the conventional discount rate of 4.5% continued to apply.
When the joined appeals reached the House of Lords in 1998, it was
accepted that it must be assumed that investment will be based on Index
Linked Government Securities (ILGS). However, a prudent investment
would be based on a balanced portfolio which would include some
riskier equities. The House of Lords held that the rate of return (and,
hence, discount) should be based on ILGS giving an average return of
3%. Consequently, the awards in the cases were raised. It is believed that
this decision has been responsible for a series of very high awards of
damages after July 1998 in cases involving long term future care.
A recent case with unusual facts on loss of earnings is Casey v Morane
Ltd (2000). Following an accident at work, the plaintiff had been found
guilty of gross misconduct and been demoted, suffering a £5,000 loss in
income. The employer had accepted 85% responsibility for the accident

174

REMEDIES

and there had been contributory negligence by the plaintiff for which
he was 15% responsible. As the employer’s breach of duty was the
predominant cause of the accident, the employer was answerable for
85% of the loss of earnings and the plaintiff was answerable for the
remaining 15%. Mance LJ said that normally, in situations where an
employee was disciplined and lost income as a result of his own misconduct,
this misconduct would normally be regarded as the relevant cause of
the accident. Consequently, the employee would bear the loss even if
someone else’s conduct had contributed to the accident. This case fell
into a special category, as the plaintiff’s behaviour was not the dominant
cause of the accident.
Lost years

Where the plaintiff’s life expectancy has been reduced as a result of his
injuries, the question is whether the plaintiff can be compensated for
the earnings he would have received between the date of his expected
death and date he would have stopped working if it had not have been
for the accident. It was held in Oliver v Ashman (1962) that claims for the
lost years were not recoverable.
The House of Lords overruled Oliver v Ashman in Pickett v British Rail
Engineering (1980) and damages for prospective loss of earnings are now
awarded for the whole of the plaintiff’s pre-accident life expectancy,
subject to deduction of the plaintiff’s living expenses.
In Phipps v Brooks Dry Cleaning Services Ltd (1996), it was held that an
award of damages for loss of earnings in the lost years was subject to a
deduction for living expenses of the injured person and his dependants.
This brings the position into line with that in fatal accident claims.
Social security and private insurance payments

Some social security payments are deducted in full from the plaintiff’s
loss of income, others are deducted at half the value of any payments.
Section 22 of the Social Security Act 1989 which is now incorporated
into the Social Security Administration Act 1992 enables welfare payments
made to the plaintiff to be recouped from the defendant. The system
was amended by the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997.
The full value of all recoverable benefits during the relevant period
(applying to all settlements and judgments after 6 October 1997) must
be deducted before payment from the plaintiff’s damages. The defendant
cannot pay the damages award until he has obtained a certificate of the
benefits paid or payable and recovered the same from the award.
It was held by the House of Lords in Wisely v John Fulton (Plumbers)
Ltd; Wadey v Surrey CC (2000) that a plaintiff in a personal injuries action

175

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

who had received social security benefits which would be repayable to
the Secretary of State under the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits)
Act 1997 was entitled to recover interest on all his damages for past loss
of earnings.
Private insurance payments are not deducted since the defendant
would therefore profit from the plaintiff’s foresight. Payments made
under an accident insurance policy taken out by an employer on behalf
of employees is also non deductible (McCamley v Cammell Laird Shipbuilders
Ltd (1990)). Ex gratia payments made by a charity are also not deductible.
An occupational disability pension is not deducted (Parry v Cleaver
(1970)). This was affirmed in Smoker v London Fire and Civil Defence
Authority (1991) on the basis that a pension is deferred payment.
Occupational sick pay will be deducted (Hussain v New Taplow Paper
Mills Ltd (1988)).
In Longdon v British Coal Corporation (1998), the House of Lords held
that an incapacity pension awarded before normal retirement age should
not be deducted.
Pain and suffering

The plaintiff is entitled to be compensated for actual and prospective
pain and suffering. Section 1(1)(6) of the Administration of Justice Act
1982 allows a plaintiff who knows that his life expectancy has been
reduced to recover for that anguish. A permanently unconscious plaintiff
cannot claim for pain and suffering (Wise v Kaye (1962)).
The level of damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity was
increased by the Court of Appeal in Heil v Rankin (2000). The Law
Commission’s report, Damages for Personal Injury: Non-Pecuniary Loss
(1999, Law Com No 257) had recommended that the level of damages
for non-pecuniary loss for personal injuries should be increased.
Consequently, it was held that there should be no increase for awards
which were currently below £10,000; for awards above £10,000, there
should be a tapered increase up to a maximum increase of one third in
awards for the most catastrophic injuries.
In McFarlane v Tayside Health Board (1999), the mother of a child born
after her husband had undergone a vasectomy was entitled in damages
for the pain and discomfort of an unwanted pregnancy and delivery.
However, the parents of a healthy child born after a vasectomy operation
were not entitled to damages in respect of the costs of caring for and
bringing up the child.

176

REMEDIES

Loss of faculty and amenity

A tariff system of £X for the loss of a leg and £Y for the loss of an arm
exists. Refer to Kemp and Kemp for details. Loss of amenity involves the
lost chances to use the faculty. Loss of amenity will be greater for a keen
sportsman that loses a leg than a couch potato who spends his life
watching television.
The award of loss of amenity is made objectively, it was held in H
West & Sons Ltd v Shephard (1964), where the plaintiff was unconscious
and unable to appreciate his condition.

New methods of paying damages in
personal injury cases
Structured settlements

For many years, damages were assessed once and paid in one lump sum
payment. The rule that damages are assessed once still applies but since
the case of Kelly v Dawes (1989) payments can be made in the form of
periodic payments known as structured settlements. These were first
introduced in the US and Canada, where they are further advanced.
Their inception in this country was made possible by the Inland Revenue
agreeing that periodic payments were payment of capital and not income
which had certain tax advantages.
The system works with the lump sum being calculated in the conventional
way. Part of the lump sum is paid over to the plaintiff immediately. The
rest of the payment is used to purchase an annuity from an insurer with
payments being structured over a given period which can be for the
plaintiff’s lifetime or longer if the plaintiff has dependants.
Advantages of structured settlements

The main advantage is that the periodic payments are free of tax in the
plaintiff’s hands. The payments are treated by the Inland Revenue as
an ‘antecedent debt’ and are therefore treated as capital rather than
income and are not subject to income tax. Contrast this with the investment
income from a lump sum which is subject to income tax.
There are also financial advantages for the defendant’s insurer. As
structures involve the insurer in greater administration costs and they
also argue that they are entitled to a share of the resulting tax benefits
to the plaintiff, they are able to negotiate a discount on the lump sum,
which is usually between the range of 8–15%. It has been argued that a
discount in excess of 8% makes structured settlements unattractive as
they are likely to be out performed by investments. This view has been

177

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

criticised on the grounds that it overlooks the value of the certainty the
plaintiff has in knowing that his periodic payments are secure. They are
useful in cases where the plaintiff would be unable to manage a lump
sum payment. They also lead to the plaintiff escaping management and
investment costs of investing a lump sum. This better reflects the situation
the plaintiff would have been in if the tort had not been committed than
a lump sum payment, as a regular income avoids the stress of financial
management and does not need the presence of financial experts to
ensure its continuance.
The income derived from the annuity is protected from the vagaries
of the inflation rate or wild fluctuations in the stock market.
There is flexibility in the creation of the structure. The parties can
decide the proportion of the lump sum payment that is to go into an
immediate capital payment and how much is to go into the structure.
They ensure that the payments will not cease during the plaintiff’s
lifetime. A lump sum payment can be dissipated by the plaintiff either
through being spendthrift or through ill advised investment or because
a prognosis as to life expectancy proves to be incorrect with the plaintiff
living longer than has been anticipated. Regardless of the manner in
which the dissipation occurs, the plaintiff will become a charge on the
State when it is the aim of the compensation system to avoid this
happening.
The Law Commission identified other advantages such as encouraging
early settlement, thereby saving time and costs and providing certainty
for the plaintiff. Early settlement reduces the stress of the litigation
process which has proved to be harmful to the plaintiff’s rehabilitation.
As they provide the plaintiff with an income, they better fulfil the aims
of compensation compared to a lump sum payment as they actually
substitute what the plaintiff has lost. They provide income in place of
lost earnings.
An advantage for the State is that the defendant is much less likely
to claim welfare benefit. It also creates less pressure on the legal system
as it promotes early settlement of claims and it ensures that the compensation
is used for the purpose for which it is intended. Early settlement improves
the image of the compensation system. Instead of the insurer handing
over a lump sum to the plaintiff and washing his hands entirely of the
case, the replacement system ensures provision is made for the rest of
the plaintiff’s life. In this sense, it is a more humane system.
Disadvantages of structured settlements

One of the disadvantages is that the amount of the structure is only
assessed once the problem of guesswork involved in the assessment of

178

REMEDIES

damages is not solved. The Law Commission in their Consultation Paper
said ‘the pressure to get it right at an early stage is extreme’. It is still
possible for the amount of damages to prove inadequate due to an
incorrect prognosis. The Pearson Commission recommended a system
of structured settlements which would be reviewed in the light of
deteriorating financial circumstances which would circumvent some of
the problems relating to guesswork, but the proposal has not been
adopted. To a certain extent, all compensatory systems are subject to a
certain amount of guesswork. Even a fully reviewable system of periodic
payments still has to be based on assumptions relating to promotion
prospects, etc.
A further disadvantage is that the operation of the structure is not
very flexible. Once the structure is established, it cannot be changed. If
there is unforeseen demand for capital, the structure will not be able to
accommodate this need. This contrasts with the degree of flexibility
which exists at the time the structure is created when the parties can
decide how much will be given in immediate capital payment and how
much will go into the structure. For a minority of plaintiffs, the loss of
freedom and discretion as to the manner in which the lump sum should
be invested is a serious disadvantage.
At one time, the plaintiff was subject to the risk that the insurer could
become insolvent. Following the Law Commission’s Report No 224, the
plaintiff is now protected from failure of the life office. Structured
settlements have been brought within the Policyholders’ Protection Act
1975. The Secretary of State can guarantee ‘directly funded’ settlements
such as those by NHS trusts.
The system may simply replace ‘compensation neurosis’ with a
different form of neurosis. The plaintiff may perceive his dependency
on the monthly cheque as making his position analogous to a welfare
recipient. The system also increases administrative costs and imposes a
long-term financial obligation on the defendant.
If the question is looked at in its wider context, then it can be seen
that as tort victims are already generously compensated in comparison
to those who receive compensation outside the tort system then the
system in the words of Michael Jones in Textbook on Torts makes an ‘elite
group even more elite’.
Structured settlements do not alter the fact that the system is predicated
on compensating the plaintiff for what he has lost rather than on what he
needs. By alleviating some of the difficulties associated with the lump
sum system, structured settlements may simply be postponing a more
fundamental reform of the compensation system.

179

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

Limits to structured settlements

Structures cannot be used in all cases and certain limits have been placed
upon them:
• both parties must consent to the structure. It was held in Burke v Tower
Hamlets AHA (1989) that the defendant could not be made to make
periodic payments against its wishes;
• a structure cannot be imposed after the parties have formally agreed
settlement or obtained judgment for a certain sum;
• to preserve a structure where a case goes to trial, s 2 of the Damages
Act 1996 enables the court with the consent of both parties to make
an award under which damages are wholly or partly paid by periodic
payments;
• a structure cannot be imposed where provisional damages are sought
nor where interim damages have been awarded;
• it cannot be used in very small claims as administrative costs make
it uneconomic;
• they cannot be used where there is no liability, for example, awards
made by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (CICB), despite
their decisions being subject to judicial review.
So far, structures have only been awarded in cases of personal injury
and it is doubtful whether they will be extended into other areas.
Structures are not available for special damages but are reserved
specifically for general damages, that is, those damages which cannot
be calculated precisely, including future loss.
Structured settlements are now used much less frequently than in the
past. Several reasons have been suggested for this, including the House
of Lords decision in Wells v Wells, the global economic climate and radical
changes in procedure and practice in civil cases introduced in 1999.
Provisional damages

One solution to the problem of guesswork in the assessment of damages
is provisional damages. Established by s 6 of the Administration of Justice
Act 1982 which amends s 32(a) of the Supreme Court Act 1981. They
enable the plaintiff in personal injury cases, where there is a ‘chance’
that, as a result of the tort, the plaintiff will develop some serious
deterioration in his condition, to be awarded provisional damages
assessed on the basis that the disease or deterioration will not occur.
This can help alleviate the stress on a plaintiff who is worried that his
compensation will prove inadequate in the event of his injuries being
worse than expected.
180

REMEDIES

However, the procedure is only rarely used. The first award of provisional
damages must be made by court order. The parties thereby lose the
advantages which arise from a private settlement of the case. There have
been problems over the definition of ‘chance’ of a ‘serious deterioration’.
In Willson v Ministry of Defence (1991), the development of arthritis after
an ankle injury was held to be a progression of a particular disease and
not a ‘chance event’. Scott Baker J said that there had to be ‘a clear and
severable risk rather than a continuing deterioration’. Further disadvantages
are that the plaintiff is only allowed one further chance of a review of
his damages and in practice the plaintiff must ask for less damages than
he would otherwise be entitled to since the provisional award ignores
the fact that a deterioration can occur.
The Law Commission is considering reforms to the system of provisional
damages but has initially said in its Consultation Paper that few reforms
are needed. The drawbacks mean that the system has not been widely
used and has mainly been used in cases where there is a chance of
epilepsy or there has been exposure to asbestos.
Split trials and interim damages

Split trials and interim damages mean that there can be separate trials
on liability and quantum of damages. This is permitted by Ord 33, r 4 of
the Rules of the Supreme Court. It is an exception to the finality of
litigation principle since it allows two actions. Order 29, r 11 of the Rules
of the Supreme Court allow an interim award of damages to be made
to the plaintiff pending the outcome of the quantum portion of the trial,
where the plaintiff shows need. The advantage of the system is that the
question of quantum can be settled at a later date when the plaintiff’s
prognosis is clearer and can, therefore, be more accurately assessed.
The disadvantage of the system is that it adds to delay in the final
settlement of cases. Delay is already a feature of the compensation system
that attracts a considerable amount of criticism. They are also treated with
a certain amount of distrust by defendants who fear that the delay will
enable the plaintiff to set up an expensive care programme.
Damage to property

Where property is completely destroyed, the measure of damages is the
market value of the property at the time of destruction.
In Liesbosch Dredger v SS Edison (1933), the plaintiffs were unable to
recover where they had incurred additional expenses since they were
too impecunious to hire an alternative vessel while theirs was being
repaired.

181

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

More recently, hire costs have been allowed in Martindale v Duncan
(1973). In Motorworks Ltd v Alwahabi (1977), it was reasonable for the
plaintiff to hire a Rolls Royce, while his own Rolls Royce was being
repaired.
Where property is damaged but not destroyed, the measure of damages
is the diminution in value, normally the cost of repair.
Mitigation of loss

A plaintiff has a duty to mitigate the damage that results from the
defendant’s tort. But no wrong is committed against the defendant if he
fails to do so. In Darbishire v Warran (1963), it was said that the plaintiff
is ‘entitled to be as extravagant as he pleases but not at the expense of
the defendant’.
Injunctions
An injunction is an equitable remedy and is therefore, discretionary. A
prohibitory injunction is an order of the court requiring the defendant
to cease committing a continuing tort. As an equitable remedy, it will
not be awarded if damages would be an adequate remedy.
Mandatory injunctions are not granted so readily as prohibitory
injunctions; there must be a strong probability that very serious damage
to the plaintiff will result if withheld.

Death in relation to tort
Death can extinguish liability for tort and it may also, in certain
circumstances, create liability in tort.
Death as extinguishing liability
At common law, the general rule was that death of either party extinguished
any existing cause of action by one against the other. Actions in contract
and instances where the deceased appropriated the property to his estate
escaped this rule.
As a result of this rule, if a negligent driver was killed in an accident
which had been caused by his own negligence, then nothing could be
recovered from his estate or from his insurer. The Law Reform (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1934 was passed to provide for the survival of the causes
of action.

182

REMEDIES

Survival of causes of action
Section 1(1) provides that all causes of action subsisting against or vested
in any person on his death, except causes of action for defamation, now
survive against, or, as the case may be, for the benefit of, his estate.
It is not possible to defame the dead but there have been recommendations
that there should be a right of action for five years after a person dies
which would be available to close relations.
‘Subsisting’ action
The Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 specifies that the
right of action must be ‘subsisting’, sometimes the wrongdoer may have
died before a cause of action has accrued, for example, a manufacturer
may have died before his product has actually caused damage.
Section 1(4) provides where damage has been suffered as a result of
a wrongful act in respect of which a cause of action would have subsisted
had the wrongdoer not died before or at the same time as the damage
was suffered, there shall be deemed to have subsisted against him before
his death such cause of action as would have subsisted if he had died
after the damage had been suffered.
Damages recoverable
Where the injured party dies, the damages recoverable for the benefit
of the estate may not include exemplary damages, nor any damages for
loss of income for any period after the victim’s death.
The latter is concerned with the ‘lost years’ whereby a victim can
claim for loss of earnings during a period during which he could have
been expected to live had he not had his life expectancy reduced by the
defendant. The ‘lost years’ are not recoverable when the defendant is
dead. The reason lies behind the relationship between the Law Reform
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 and the Fatal Accidents Act 1976:
• if a dead defendant was liable for the ‘lost years’ then he would be
doubly liable as he would have to compensate dependants for the
same thing under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976;
• if the injured person died as a result of the accident in respect of which
his dependants or his estate are claiming, then the damage must be
calculated without reference to any loss or gain to the deceased’s
estate except funeral expenses;

183

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

• if the deceased’s death is unconnected with the incident which gave
rise to the cause of action, substantial damages can be recovered even
in situations where the deceased, had he been alive, would only have
been entitled to nominal damages;
• death terminates losses such as pain and suffering and loss of amenity;
• damages recovered on behalf of a deceased form part of his estate
and can be used to pay off his debts and be given as legacies.
The Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 applies to claims
by estates, as does the law of limitations to claims by or against estates.
When the tortfeasor dies, the ordinary measure of damages will apply.
Death as creating liability
The Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 allowed actions
to continue against deceased persons and also allowed for the continuance
of claims by deceased persons.
Another rule of the common law said that death did not give rise to
a cause of action in other persons even though they may have been
dependent on the deceased.
It was said by Lord Ellenborough in Baker v Bolton (1808) that ‘the
death of a human being could not be complained of as an injury’.
Fatal Accidents Act 1976

Initially, the Fatal Accidents Act 1846 overturned the common law as
far as dependants who were specified in the Act and in later legislation
were concerned.
The Fatal Accidents Act 1976 consolidates earlier legislation. The 1976
Act provides that whenever the death of a person is caused by the
wrongful act, neglect or default of another such as would have entitled
the injured person who would have been liable if death had not ensued
shall be liable to an action for damages on behalf of the dependants.
Dependants

Section 1 of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 was amended by the Administration
of Justice Act 1982 the class now includes:
• a spouse or former spouse of the deceased, or person who was living
as the spouse of the deceased, in the same household, immediately
before the date of the death and had been so living for at least two
years;

184

REMEDIES

• any parent or other ascendant of the deceased or person treated by
the deceased as his parent;
• any child or other descendant of the deceased or any person who has
been treated as a child of the family in relation to any marriage of the
deceased;
• any person who is, or is the issue of a brother, sister, uncle or aunt of
the deceased.
An adopted person is a child of the persons by whom he or she was
adopted, a half blood relation is treated as a full relation. A stepchild of
any person is treated as the stepparents’ child and an illegitimate person
is treated as the legitimate child of the mother and reputed father.
An action under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 must normally be brought
on behalf of the dependants by his executor or administrator of the
deceased but where there is no personal representative any dependant
entitled to sue under the Act may sue in his own name and on behalf of
other dependants. An action must be brought within three years.
Nature of the action

Rights of action under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 is a new cause of
action, separate from the deceased’s cause of action. There is no claim
if the deceased’s action is statute barred at the date of his death.
Under the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1948, if the
deceased was partly to blame for the accident, the dependant’s damages
will be reduced accordingly.
What is recoverable

In respect of death after 1982, the spouse of the deceased or the parents
of a minor who never married may claim a fixed sum of £7,500 for
‘bereavement’.
The wide class of dependants may claim damages for loss of support.
The damages must be proportioned to the injury. The Act lays down no
principle for assessing damage. The test normally used is Franklin v SE
Railway (1858), damages must be calculated per Pollock CB ‘in reference
to a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit as of right, or otherwise,
from the continuance of the life’. Thus, if the dependants have only
suffered nominal damage, no damages will be recoverable. Loss of a
mother’s care is held to be a pecuniary benefit.
A son who was killed but had worked for his father for full wages,
did not entitle the father to a claim, as these had been properly paid but

185

ESSENTIAL TORT LAW

a father was entitled to a claim under the Act when the son had voluntarily
assisted him in the business.
There will also be a claim where there is reasonable probability that
a person, likely in the near future to earn a substantial wage, and thereby
support dependants, is killed. This will not apply if there is a possibility
of someone supporting the claimant in the near future.
Assessment of damages

Damages for bereavement are a fixed sum owed to a narrow class of
persons. Other damages are assessed on a pecuniary loss basis. Each
dependant’s pecuniary loss will be separately assessed. The process of
assessment is very similar to personal injury assessment. The court
determines the net annual loss and then works out a multiplier. The
deceased’s net annual income will be reduced to allow for a portion of
income which would have been spent entirely on himself. Benefits which
have accrued to the deceased’s estate since his death are disregarded.
It was held in Hunter v Butler (1995) that there is no loss of dependency
under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 in respect of undeclared earnings,
otherwise known as ‘moonlighting’ or for loss of housing benefit and
supplementary benefit.
