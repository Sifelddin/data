Problems

When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers,
you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you
cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory
kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your
thoughts, advanced to the stage of science.
—William Thomson, Lord Kelvin (1891)

1 Introduction
This chapter begins with a section on units of measurement. Engineers need to be
familiar with both the American units of feet, pounds, hours, and degrees Fahrenheit
as well as the more recommended International System of units. Both are used in the
practice of environmental engineering.
Next, two fundamental topics, which should be familiar from the study of elementary physics, are presented: the law of conservation of mass and the law of conservation of energy. These laws tell us that within any environmental system, we
theoretically should be able to account for the flow of energy and materials into, and
out of, that system. The law of conservation of mass, besides providing an important
tool for quantitatively tracking pollutants as they disperse in the environment,
reminds us that pollutants have to go somewhere, and that we should be wary of
approaches that merely transport them from one medium to another.

Mass and Energy Transfer

In a similar way, the law of conservation of energy is also an essential accounting tool with special environmental implications. When coupled with other thermodynamic principles, it will be useful in a number of applications, including the study
of global climate change, thermal pollution, and the dispersion of air pollutants.

Units of Measurement
In the United States, environmental quantities are measured and reported in both
the U.S. Customary System (USCS) and the International System of Units (SI), so it
is important to be familiar with both. Here, preference is given to SI units, although
the U.S. system will be used in some circumstances. Table 1 lists conversion factors
between the SI and USCS systems for some of the most basic units that will be encountered.
In the study of environmental engineering, it is common to encounter both
extremely large quantities and extremely small ones. The concentration of some
toxic substance may be measured in parts per billion (ppb), for example, whereas a
country’s rate of energy use may be measured in thousands of billions of watts
(terawatts). To describe quantities that may take on such extreme values, it is useful
to have a system of prefixes that accompany the units. Some of the most important
prefixes are presented in Table 2.
Often, it is the concentration of some substance in air or water that is of
interest. Using the metric system in either medium, concentrations may be
based on mass (usually mg or g), volume (usually L or m3), or number (usually
mol), which can lead to some confusion. It may be helpful to recall from chemistry
that one mole of any substance has Avogadro’s number of molecules in it
(6.02 * 1023 molecules/mol) and has a mass equal to its molecular weight.

Liquids
Concentrations of substances dissolved in water are usually expressed in terms of
mass or number per unit volume of mixture. Most often the units are milligrams (mg),

micrograms (mg), or moles (mol) of substance per liter (L) of mixture. At times, they
may be expressed in grams per cubic meter (g/m3).
Alternatively, concentrations in liquids are expressed as mass of substance per
mass of mixture, with the most common units being parts per million (ppm) or parts
per billion (ppb). To help put these units in perspective, 1 ppm is about the same as
1 drop of vermouth added to 15 gallons of gin, whereas 1 ppb is about the same as
one drop of pollutant in a fairly large (70 m3) back-yard swimming pool. Since most
concentrations of pollutants are very small, 1 liter of mixture has a mass that is
essentially 1,000 g, so for all practical purposes, we can write
1 mg/L = 1 g/m3 = 1 ppm (by weight)
3

1 mg/L = 1 mg/m = 1 ppb (by weight)

(1)
(2)

In unusual circumstances, the concentration of liquid wastes may be so high
that the specific gravity of the mixture is affected, in which case a correction to (1)
and (2) may be required:
mg/L = ppm (by weight) * specific gravity of mixture

EXAMPLE 1 Fluoridation of Water
The fluoride concentration in drinking water may be increased to help prevent
tooth decay by adding sodium fluoride; however, if too much fluoride is added,
it can cause discoloring (mottling) of the teeth. The optimum dose of fluoride in
drinking water is about 0.053 mM (millimole/liter). If sodium fluoride (NaF) is
purchased in 25 kg bags, how many gallons of drinking water would a bag treat?
(Assume there is no fluoride already in the water.)

3

Mass and Energy Transfer

Solution Note that the mass in the 25 kg bag is the sum of the mass of the
sodium and the mass of the fluoride in the compound. The atomic weight of
sodium is 23.0, and fluoride is 19.0, so the molecular weight of NaF is 42.0. The
ratio of sodium to fluoride atoms in NaF is 1:1. Therefore, the mass of fluoride in
the bag is
mass F = 25 kg *

19.0 g/mol
= 11.31 kg
42.0 g/mol

Converting the molar concentration to a mass concentration, the optimum concentration of fluoride in water is
F =

0.053 mmol/L * 19.0 g/mol * 1,000 mg/g
1,000 mmol/mol

= 1.01 mg/L

The mass concentration of a substance in a fluid is generically
C =

m
V

(4)

where m is the mass of the substance and V is the volume of the fluid. Using (4)
and the results of the two calculations above, the volume of water that can be
treated is
V =

11.31 kg * 106 mg/kg
1.01 mg/L * 3.785 L/gal

= 2.97 * 106 gal

The bag would treat a day’s supply of drinking water for about 20,000 people in
the United States!

Gases
For most air pollution work, it is customary to express pollutant concentrations in
volumetric terms. For example, the concentration of a gaseous pollutant in parts per
million (ppm) is the volume of pollutant per million volumes of the air mixture:
1 volume of gaseous pollutant
106 volumes of air

= 1 ppm (by volume) = 1 ppmv

(5)

To help remind us that this fraction is based on volume, it is common to add a “v”
to the ppm, giving ppmv, as suggested in (5).
At times, concentrations are expressed as mass per unit volume, such as mg/m3
or mg/m3. The relationship between ppmv and mg/m3 depends on the pressure, temperature, and molecular weight of the pollutant. The ideal gas law helps us establish
that relationship:
PV = nRT
where
P ⫽ absolute pressure (atm)
V ⫽ volume (m3)
n = mass (mol)

4

(6)

Mass and Energy Transfer

R ⫽ ideal gas constant = 0.082056 L # atm # K - 1 # mol - 1
T = absolute temperature (K)
The mass in (6) is expressed as moles of gas. Also note the temperature is
expressed in kelvins (K), where
K = °C + 273.15

(7)

There are a number of ways to express pressure; in (6), we have used atmospheres. One
atmosphere of pressure equals 101.325 kPa (Pa is the abbreviation for Pascals). One
atmosphere is also equal to 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi), so 1 psi = 6.89 kPa.
Finally, 100 kPa is called a bar, and 100 Pa is a millibar, which is the unit of pressure
often used in meteorology.

EXAMPLE 2 Volume of an Ideal Gas
Find the volume that 1 mole of an ideal gas would occupy at standard temperature and pressure (STP) conditions of 1 atmosphere of pressure and 0°C temperature. Repeat the calculation for 1 atm and 25°C.
Solution
V =

Using (6) at a temperature of 0°C (273.15 K) gives
1 mol * 0.082056 L # atm # K-1 # mol-1 * 273.15 K
= 22.414 L
1 atm

and at 25°C (298.15 K)
V =

1 mol * 0.082056 L # atm # K-1 # mol-1 * 298.15 K
= 22.465 L
1 atm

From Example 2, 1 mole of an ideal gas at 0°C and 1 atm occupies a volume
of 22.414 L (22.414 * 10 - 3 m3). Thus we can write
mg/m3 = ppmv *

1 m3 pollutant>106 m3 air
ppmv

mol wt (g/mol)
*

22.414 * 10-3 m3/mol

* 103 mg/g

or, more simply,
mg/m3 =

ppmv * mol wt
22.414

(at 0°C and 1 atm)

(8)

Similarly, at 25°C and 1 atm, which are the conditions that are assumed when air
quality standards are specified in the United States,
mg/m3 =

ppmv * mol wt
24.465

(at 25°C and 1 atm)

(9)

In general, the conversion from ppm to mg/m3 is given by
mg/m3 =

EXAMPLE 3 Converting ppmv to mg/m3
The U.S. Air Quality Standard for carbon monoxide (based on an 8-hour measurement) is 9.0 ppmv. Express this standard as a percent by volume as well as in
mg/m3 at 1 atm and 25°C.
Solution Within a million volumes of this air there are 9.0 volumes of CO, no
matter what the temperature or pressure (this is the advantage of the ppmv units).
Hence, the percentage by volume is simply
percent CO =

9.0
* 100 = 0.0009%
1 * 106

To find the concentration in mg/m3, we need the molecular weight of CO, which
is 28 (the atomic weights of C and O are 12 and 16, respectively). Using (9) gives
CO =

9.0 * 28
= 10.3 mg/m3
24.465

Actually, the standard for CO is usually rounded and listed as 10 mg/m3.

The fact that 1 mole of every ideal gas occupies the same volume (under the
same temperature and pressure condition) provides several other interpretations of
volumetric concentrations expressed as ppmv. For example, 1 ppmv is 1 volume of
pollutant per million volumes of air, which is equivalent to saying 1 mole of pollutant per million moles of air. Similarly, since each mole contains the same number of
molecules, 1 ppmv also corresponds to 1 molecule of pollutant per million molecules
of air.
1 ppmv =

Materials Balance
Everything has to go somewhere is a simple way to express one of the most fundamental engineering principles. More precisely, the law of conservation of mass says
that when chemical reactions take place, matter is neither created nor destroyed
(though in nuclear reactions, mass can be converted to energy). What this concept
allows us to do is track materials, for example pollutants, from one place to another
with mass balance equations. This is one of the most widely used tools in analyzing
pollutants in the environment.
The first step in a mass balance analysis is to define the particular region in
space that is to be analyzed. This is often called the control volume. As examples,
the control volume might include anything from a glass of water or simple chemical
mixing tank, to an entire coal-fired power plant, a lake, a stretch of stream, an air
basin above a city, or the globe itself. By picturing an imaginary boundary around

FIGURE 1 A materials balance diagram.

the region, as is suggested in Figure 1, we can then begin to quantify the flow of materials across the boundary as well as the accumulation and reaction of materials
within the region.
A substance that enters the control volume has four possible fates. Some of it
may leave the region unchanged, some of it may accumulate within the boundary,
and some of it may be converted to some other substance (e.g., entering CO may be
oxidized to CO2 within the region). There is also the possibility that more substance
may be produced (e.g., CO may be produced by cigarette smoking within the control volume of a room). Often, the conversion and production processes that may
occur are lumped into a single category termed reactions. Thus, using Figure 1 as a
guide, the following materials balance equation can be written for each substance of
interest:
a

Accumulation
Input
Output
Reaction
b = a
b - a
b + a
b
rate
rate
rate
rate

(12)

The reaction rate may be positive if generation of the substance is faster than its
decay, or negative if it is decaying faster than it is being produced. Likewise, the accumulation rate may be positive or negative. The reaction term in (12) does not imply
a violation of the law of conservation of mass. Atoms are conserved, but there is no
similar constraint on the chemical compounds, which may chemically change from
one substance into another. It is also important to notice that each term in (12) quantifies a mass rate of change (e.g., mg/s, lb/hr) and not a mass. Strictly, then, it is a mass
rate balance rather than a mass balance, and (12) denotes that the rate of mass accumulation is equal to the difference between the rate the mass enters and leaves plus
the net rate that the mass reacts within the defined control volume.
Frequently, (12) can be simplified. The most common simplification results
when steady state or equilibrium conditions can be assumed. Equilibrium simply
means that there is no accumulation of mass with time; the system has had its inputs
held constant for a long enough time that any transients have had a chance to die out.
Pollutant concentrations are constant. Hence the accumulation rate term in (12) is set
equal to zero, and problems can usually be solved using just simple algebra.
A second simplification to (12) results when a substance is conserved within
the region in question, meaning there is no reaction occurring—no radioactive
decay, bacterial decomposition, or chemical decay or generation. For such conservative substances, the reaction rate in (12) is 0. Examples of substances that are typically modeled as conservative include total dissolved solids in a body of water, heavy
metals in soils, and carbon dioxide in air. Radioactive radon gas in a home or

decomposing organic wastes in a lake are examples of nonconservative substances.
Often problems involving nonconservative substances can be simplified when the
reaction rate is small enough to be ignored.

Steady-State Conservative Systems
The simplest systems to analyze are those in which steady state can be assumed (so
the accumulation rate equals 0), and the substance in question is conservative (so the
reaction rate equals 0). In these cases, (12) simplifies to the following:
Input rate = Output rate

(13)

Consider the steady-state conservative system shown in Figure 2. The system
contained within the boundaries might be a lake, a section of a free flowing stream,
or the mass of air above a city. One input to the system is a stream (of water or air,
for instance) with a flow rate Qs (volume/time) and pollutant concentration Cs
(mass/volume). The other input is assumed to be a waste stream with flow rate Qw
and pollutant concentration Cw. The output is a mixture with flow rate Qm and
pollutant concentration Cm. If the pollutant is conservative, and if we assume
steady state conditions, then a mass balance based on (13) allows us to write the following:
Cs Qs + Cw Qw = Cm Qm

(14)

The following example illustrates the use of this equation. More importantly, it also
provides a general algorithm for doing mass balance problems.

EXAMPLE 4 Two Polluted Streams
A stream flowing at 10.0 m3/s has a tributary feeding into it with a flow of 5.0 m3/s.
The stream’s concentration of chloride upstream of the junction is 20.0 mg/L, and
the tributary chloride concentration is 40.0 mg/L. Treating chloride as a conservative substance and assuming complete mixing of the two streams, find the
downstream chloride concentration.
Solution The first step in solving a mass balance problem is to sketch the problem, identify the “region” or control volume that we want to analyze, and label
the variables as has been done in Figure 3 for this problem.

b = a

The simplified (12) is then written in terms of the variables in the sketch
0 = CsQs + CwQw - CmQm
The next step is to rearrange the expression to solve for the variable of interest—
in this case, the chloride concentration downstream of the junction, Cm. Note
that since the mixture’s flow is the sum of the two stream flows, Qs + Qw can be
substituted for Qm in this expression.
Cm =

CsQs + CwQw
CsQs + CwQw
=
Qm
Qs + Qw

The final step is to substitute the appropriate values for the known quantities into
the expression, which brings us to a question of units. The units given for C are
mg/L, and the units for Q are m3/s. Taking the product of concentrations and
flow rates yields mixed units of mg/L # m3/s, which we could simplify by applying
the conversion factor of 103 L = 1 m3. However, if we did so, we should have to
reapply that same conversion factor to get the mixture concentration back into
the desired units of mg/L. In problems of this sort, it is much easier to simply
leave the mixed units in the expression, even though they may look awkward at
first, and let them work themselves out in the calculation. The downstream concentration of chloride is thus
Cm =

(20.0 * 10.0 + 40.0 * 5.0) mg/L # m3/s
(10.0 + 5.0) m3/s

= 26.7 mg/L

This stream mixing problem is relatively simple, whatever the approach used.
Drawing the system, labeling the variables and parameters, writing and simplifying the mass balance equation, and then solving it for the variable of interest is
the same approach that will be used to solve much more complex mass balance
problems later in this chapter.

Batch Systems with Nonconservative Pollutants
The simplest system with a nonconservative pollutant is a batch system. By definition, there is no contaminant flow into or out of a batch system, yet the contaminants in the system undergo chemical, biological, or nuclear reactions fast enough
that they must be treated as nonconservative substances. A batch system (reactor)
assumes that its contents are homogeneously distributed and is often referred to as a
completely mixed batch reactor (CMBR). The bacterial concentration in a closed
water storage tank may be considered a nonconservative pollutant in a batch reactor because it will change with time even though no water is fed into or withdrawn
from the tank. Similarly, the concentration of carbon dioxide in a poorly ventilated
room can be modeled as a nonconservative batch system because the concentration
of carbon dioxide increases as people in the room breathe. For a batch reactor, (12)
simplifies to
Accumulation rate = Reaction rate

(15)

As discussed before, the reaction rate is the sum of the rates of decay, which
are negative, and the rates of generation, which are positive. Although the rates of
reaction can exhibit many dependencies and complex relationships, most nuclear,
chemical, and biochemical reaction rates can be approximated as either zero-, first-,
or second-order reaction rates. In a zero-order reaction, the rate of reaction, r(C), of
the substance is not dependent on the amount of the substance present and can be
expressed as
r(C) = k (generation)

or

r(C) = -k (decay)

(16)
-1

where k is a reaction rate coefficient, which has the units of mass # volume # time - 1
(e.g., mg # L-1 # s-1). The rate of evaporation of water from a bucket is a zero-order
reaction because the rate of loss of the water is not dependent on the amount of
water in the bucket but is only dependent on the nearly constant surface area of the
water exposed to the air.
Using (15) and (16), the mass balance for the zero-order reaction of a substance in a batch reactor is
V

dC
= -Vk
dt

The equation is written as a zero-order decay, denoted by the negative sign on the
right-hand side of the equation. So that each term in the mass balance has the correct units of mass/time, both the accumulation and reaction terms are multiplied by
the volume of the batch reactor. Although in a batch system, the volume coefficient
disappears by dividing both sides by V, it is worth remembering its presence in the
initial balance equation because in other systems it may not cancel out. To solve the
differential equation, the variables are separated and integrated as

FIGURE 4 Concentration of a substance reacting in a batch system with zero-order

Solving for concentration gives us
C = C0 - kt

(18)

where C0 is the initial concentration. Using (18) and its analog for a zero-order generation reaction, Figure 4 shows how the concentration of a substance will change
with time, if it is reacting (either being generated or destroyed) with zero-order kinetics.
For all nonconservative pollutants undergoing a reaction other than zeroorder, the rate of the reaction is dependent on the concentration of the pollutant
present. Although decay and generation rates may be any order, the most commonly
encountered reaction rate for generation is zero-order, whereas for decay it is firstorder. The first-order reaction rate is
r(C) = kC (generation)

or

r(C) = - kC (decay)

(19)

where k is still a reaction rate constant, but now has the units of reciprocal time
(time - 1). Radioactive decay of radon gas follows first-order decay—the mass that
decays per given time is directly proportional to the mass that is originally present.
Using (15) and (19), the mass balance for a pollutant undergoing first-order decay in
a batch reactor is
V

dC
= - VkC
dt

This equation can be integrated by separation of variables and solved similarly to
(17). When solved for concentration, it yields
C = C0 e - kt

(20)

That is, assuming a first-order reaction, the concentration of the substance in
question decays exponentially. The first-order time dependence of a nonconservative
pollutant’s concentration in a batch system can be seen in Figure 5.
Although not nearly as common as first-order processes, sometimes a substance will decay or be generated by a second-order process. For instance, hydroxyl

radical reactions with volatile organic pollutants is a key step in smog generation.
However, if two hydroxyl radicals collide and react, they form a much less potent
hydrogen peroxide molecule. This is a second-order reaction, since two hydroxyl
radicals are consumed for each hydrogen peroxide produced. The second-order
reaction rate is
r(C) = kC2 (generation)

or

r(C) = - kC2 (decay)

(21)

where k is now a reaction rate constant with units of (volume # mass - 1 # time - 1).
Again substituting (21) into (15), we have the differential equation for the secondorder decay of a nonconservative substance in a batch reactor
V

dC

which can be integrated and then solved for the concentration to yield
C =

(22)

Figure 6 shows how the concentration of a substance changes with time if it decays
or is produced by a second-order reaction in a batch reactor.

Steady-State Systems with Nonconservative Pollutants
If we assume that steady-state conditions prevail and treat the pollutants as nonconservative, then (12) becomes
0 = Input rate - Output rate + Reaction rate

(23)

The batch reactor, which has just been discussed, can’t describe a steady-state
system with a nonconservative substance because now there is input and output.
Although there are an infinite number of other possible types of reactors, simply employing two other types of ideal reactors allows us to model a great number of environmental processes. The type of mixing in the system distinguishes between the

two other ideal reactors. In the first, the substances within the system are still
homogeneously mixed as in a batch reactor. Such a system is variously termed a
continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), a perfectly mixed flow reactor, and a
complete mix box model. The water in a shallow pond with an inlet and outlet is
typically modeled as a CSTR as is the air within a well-ventilated room. The key
concept is that the concentration, C, within the CSTR container is uniform throughout. We’ll give examples of CSTR behavior first and later discuss the other ideal
reactor model that is often used, the plug flow reactor (PFR).
The reaction rate term in the right-hand side of (23) can denote either a
substance’s decay or generation (by making it positive or negative) and, for most environmental purposes, its rate can be approximated as either zero-, first-, or secondorder. Just as for the batch reactor, for a CSTR, we assume the substance is
uniformly distributed throughout a volume V, so the total amount of substance
is CV. The total rate of reaction of the amount of a nonconservative substance is
thus d(CV)>dt = V dC>dt = Vr(C). So summarizing (16), (19), and (21), we can
write the reaction rate expressions for a nonconservative substance:
Zero-order, decay rate = - Vk
Zero-order, generation rate = Vk
First-order, decay rate = - VkC
First-order, generation rate = VkC
Second-order, decay rate = - VkC2
Second-order, generation rate = VkC2

(29)

Thus, for example, to model a CSTR containing a substance that is decaying with a
second-order rate, we combine (23) with (28) to get a final, simple, and useful
expression for the mass balance involving a nonconservative pollutant in a steadystate, CSTR system:
Input rate = Output rate + kC2V

EXAMPLE 5 A Polluted Lake
Consider a 10 * 106 m3 lake fed by a polluted stream having a flow rate of
5.0 m3/s and pollutant concentration equal to 10.0 mg/L (Figure 7). There is also
a sewage outfall that discharges 0.5 m3/s of wastewater having a pollutant concentration of 100 mg/L. The stream and sewage wastes have a decay rate coefficient of
0.20/day. Assuming the pollutant is completely mixed in the lake and assuming no
evaporation or other water losses or gains, find the steady-state pollutant concentration in the lake.
Solution We can conveniently use the lake in Figure 7 as our control volume.
Assuming that complete and instantaneous mixing occurs in the lake—it acts as a
CSTR—implies that the concentration in the lake, C, is the same as the concentration of the mix leaving the lake, Cm. The units (day - 1) of the reaction rate constant indicate this is a first-order reaction. Using (23) and (26):
(31)

Input rate = Output rate + kCV
We can find each term as follows:
There are two input sources, so the total input rate is
Input rate = QsCs + QwCw
The output rate is
Output rate = QmCm = (Qs + Qw)C
(31) then becomes
QsCs + QwCw = (Qs + Qw)C + kCV
And rearranging to solve for C,
C =

QsCs + QwCw
Qs + Qw + kV
5.0 m3/s * 10.0 mg/L + 0.5 m3/s * 100.0 mg/L

Mass and Energy Transfer

Idealized models involving nonconservative pollutants in completely mixed,
steady-state systems are used to analyze a variety of commonly encountered water
pollution problems such as the one shown in the previous example. The same simple
models can be applied to certain problems involving air quality, as the following
example demonstrates.
EXAMPLE 6 A Smoky Bar
A bar with volume 500 m3 has 50 smokers in it, each smoking 2 cigarettes per
hour (see Figure 8). An individual cigarette emits, among other things, about
1.4 mg of formaldehyde (HCHO). Formaldehyde converts to carbon dioxide
with a reaction rate coefficient k = 0.40/hr. Fresh air enters the bar at the rate
of 1,000 m3/hr, and stale air leaves at the same rate. Assuming complete mixing,
estimate the steady-state concentration of formaldehyde in the air. At 25°C and
1 atm of pressure, how does the result compare with the threshold for eye irritation of 0.05 ppm?
Solution The bar’s building acts as a CSTR reactor, and the complete mixing
inside means the concentration of formaldehyde C in the bar is the same as the
concentration in the air leaving the bar. Since the formaldehyde concentration in
fresh air can be considered 0, the input rate in (23) is also 0. Our mass balance
equation is then
(32)

Output rate = Reaction rate

However, both a generation term (the cigarette smoking) and a decay term (the
conversion of formaldehyde to carbon dioxide) are contributing to the reaction
rate. If we call the generation rate, G, we can write
G = 50 smokers * 2 cigs/hr * 1.4 mg/cig = 140 mg/hr
We can then express (32) in terms of the problem’s variables and (26) as
QC = G - kCV
so
C =

G

We will use (9) to convert mg/m3 to ppm. The molecular weight of formaldehyde

HCHO =

=
= 0.095 ppm

30

This is nearly double the 0.05 ppm threshold for eye irritation.
Besides a CSTR, the other type of ideal reactor that is often useful to model
pollutants as they flow through a system is a plug flow reactor (PFR). A PFR can be
visualized as a long pipe or channel in which there is no mixing of the pollutant
along its length between the inlet and outlet. A PFR could also be seen as a conveyor
belt carrying a single-file line of bottles in which reactions can happen within each
bottle, but there is no mixing of the contents of one bottle with another. The behavior of a pollutant being carried in a river or in the jet stream in the Earth’s upper
atmosphere could be usefully represented as a PFR system. The key difference between a PFR and CSTR is that in a PFR, there is no mixing of one parcel of fluid
with other parcels in front or in back of it in the control volume, whereas in a
CSTR, all of the fluid in the container is continuously and completely mixed. (23)
applies to both a CSTR and PFR at steady state, but for a PFR, we cannot make the
simplification that the concentration everywhere in the control volume and in the
fluid leaving the region is the same, as we did in the CSTR examples. The pollutant
concentration in a parcel of fluid changes as the parcel progresses through the PFR.
Intuitively, it can then be seen that a PFR acts like a conveyor belt of differentially
thin batch reactors translating through the control volume. When the pollutant enters the PFR at concentration, C0, then it will take a given time, t, to move the length
of the control volume and will leave the PFR with a concentration just as it would if
it had been in a batch reactor for that period of time. Thus, a substance decaying
with a zero-, first-, or second-order rate will leave a PFR with a concentration given
by (18), (20), and (22), respectively, with the understanding that t in each equation
is the residence time of the fluid in the control volume and is given by
t = l>v = V>Q

(33)

where l is the length of the PFR, v is the fluid velocity, V is the PFR control volume,
and Q is the fluid flowrate.
EXAMPLE 7 Young Salmon Migration
Every year, herons, seagulls, eagles, and other birds mass along a 4.75 km stretch
of stream connecting a lake to the ocean to catch the fingerling salmon as they
migrate downstream to the sea. The birds are efficient fishermen and will consume 10,000 fingerlings per kilometer of stream each hour regardless of the number of the salmon in the stream. In other words, there are enough salmon; the
birds are only limited by how fast they can catch and eat the fish. The stream’s
average cross-sectional area is 20 m2, and the salmon move downstream with the
stream’s flow rate of 700 m3/min. If there are 7 fingerlings per m3 in the water entering the stream, what is the concentration of salmon that reach the ocean when
the birds are feeding?

FIGURE 9 Birds fishing along a salmon stream.

Solution First we draw a figure depicting the stream as the control volume and
the variables (Figure 9).
Since the birds eat the salmon at a steady rate that is not dependent on the
concentration of salmon in the stream, the rate of salmon consumption is zeroorder. So,
k =

10,000 fish # km - 1 # hr - 1
20 m2 * 1,000 m/km

= 0.50 fish # m - 3 # hr - 1

For a steady-state PFR, (23) becomes (18),
C = C0 - kt
The residence time, t, of the stream can be calculated using (33) as
t =

4.75 km * 20 m2 * 1,000 m/km
V
=

Q

and the concentration of fish reaching the ocean is
C = 7 fish/m3 - 0.50 fish # m-3 # hr - 1 * 2.26 hr = 5.9 fish/m3

Step Function Response
So far, we have computed steady-state concentrations in environmental systems that
are contaminated with either conservative or nonconservative pollutants. Let us
now extend the analysis to include conditions that are not steady state. Quite often,
we will be interested in how the concentration will change with time when there is a
sudden change in the amount of pollution entering the system. This is known as the
step function response of the system.
In Figure 10, the environmental system to be modeled has been drawn as if it
were a box of volume V that has flow rate Q in and out of the box.
Let us assume the contents of the box are at all times completely mixed
(a CSTR model) so that the pollutant concentration C in the box is the same as the
concentration leaving the box. The total mass of pollutant in the box is therefore

VC, and the rate of accumulation of pollutant in the box is VdC>dt. Let us designate
the concentration of pollutant entering the box as Ci. We’ll
also assume there are both production and decay components of the reaction rate
and designate the decay coefficient kd and the generation coefficient kg. However, as
is most common, the decay will be first-order, so kd’s units are time - 1, whereas the
generation is zero-order, so kg’s units are mass # volume - 1 # time - 1. From (12), we
can write

The units given in the preceding list are representative of those that might be
encountered; any consistent set will do.
An easy way to find the steady-state solution to (34) is simply to set
dC>dt = 0, which yields
Cq =

QCi + kgV
Q + kdV

(35)

where Cq is the concentration in the box at time t = q . Our concern now, though,
is with the concentration before it reaches steady state, so we must solve (34).

EXAMPLE 8 The Smoky Bar Revisited
The bar in Example 6 had volume 500 m3 with fresh air entering at the rate of
1,000 m3/hr. Suppose when the bar opens at 5 P.M., the air is clean. If formaldehyde, with decay rate kd = 0.40/hr, is emitted from cigarette smoke at the constant
rate of 140 mg/hr starting at 5 P.M., what would the concentration be at 6 P.M.?
Solution In this case, Q = 1,000 m3/hr, V = 500 m3, G = kg, V = 140 mg/hr,
Ci = 0, and kd = 0.40/hr. The steady-state concentration is found using (35):
Cq =

140 mg/hr
G
=

Q + kdV
1,000 m /hr + 0.40/hr * 500 m3

= 0.117 mg/m3
This agrees with the result obtained in Example 6. To find the concentration at
any time after 5 P.M., we can apply (45) with C0 = 0.
C(t) = C q e 1 - expc - akd +

Q
bt d f
V

= 0.117{1 - exp[-(0.40 + 1,000>500)t]}
at 6 P.M., t = 1 hr, so
C(1 hr) = 0.11731 - exp(-2.4 * 1)4 = 0.106 mg/m3
To further demonstrate the use of (45), let us reconsider the lake analyzed in
Example 5. This time we will assume that the outfall suddenly stops draining into
the lake, so its contribution to the lake’s pollution stops.

EXAMPLE 9 A Sudden Decrease in Pollutants Discharged into a Lake
Consider the 10 * 106 m3 lake analyzed in Example 5 which, under a conditions
given, was found to have a steady-state pollution concentration of 3.5 mg/L. The
pollution is nonconservative with reaction-rate constant kd = 0.20/day. Suppose
the condition of the lake is deemed unacceptable. To solve the problem, it is decided to completely divert the sewage outfall from the lake, eliminating it as a
source of pollution. The incoming stream still has flow Qs = 5.0 m3/s and concentration Cs = 10.0 mg/L. With the sewage outfall removed, the outgoing flow
Q is also 5.0 m3/s. Assuming complete-mix conditions, find the concentration of
pollutant in the lake one week after the diversion, and find the new final steadystate concentration.
Solution

For this situation,

C0 = 3.5 mg/L
V = 10 * 106 m3
Q = Qs = 5.0 m3/s * 3,600 s/hr * 24 hr/day = 43.2 * 104 m3/day

20

Mass and Energy Transfer

Cs = 10.0 mg/L = 10.0 * 103 mg/m3
kd = 0.20/day
The total rate at which pollution is entering the lake from the incoming stream is
Qs Cs = 43.2 * 104 m3/day * 10.0 * 103 mg/m3 = 43.2 * 108 mg/day
The steady-state concentration can be obtained from (35)
Cq =

43.2 * 108 mg/day

Q + kdV
43.2 * 104 m3/day + 0.20/day * 107 m3

Using (45), we can find the concentration in the lake one week after the drop in
pollution from the outfall:
C(t) = C q + (C0 - C q )expc - a kd +

Energy Fundamentals
Just as we are able to use the law of conservation of mass to write mass balance
equations that are fundamental to understanding and analyzing the flow of materials, we can use the first law of thermodynamics to write energy balance equations
that will help us analyze energy flows.
One definition of energy is that it is the capacity for doing work, where work
can be described by the product of force and the displacement of an object caused by
that force. A simple interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics suggests
that when work is done, there will always be some inefficiency, that is, some portion
of the energy put into the process will end up as waste heat. How that waste heat

21

Mass and Energy Transfer

affects the environment is an important consideration in the study of environmental
engineering and science.
Another important term to be familiar with is power. Power is the rate of
doing work. It has units of energy per unit of time. In SI units, power is given in
joules per second (J/s) or kilojoules per second (kJ/s). To honor the Scottish engineer
James Watt, who developed the reciprocating steam engine, the joule per second has
been named the watt (1 J/s = 1 W = 3.412 Btu/hr).

The First Law of Thermodynamics
The first law of thermodynamics says, simply, that energy can neither be created nor
destroyed. Energy may change forms in any given process, as when chemical energy in
a fuel is converted to heat and electricity in a power plant or when the potential energy
of water behind a dam is converted to mechanical energy as it spins a turbine in a hydroelectric plant. No matter what is happening, the first law says we should be able to
account for every bit of energy as it takes part in the process under study, so that in the
end, we have just as much as we had in the beginning. With proper accounting, even
nuclear reactions involving conversion of mass to energy can be treated.
To apply the first law, it is necessary to define the system being studied, much
as was done in the analysis of mass flows. The system (control volume) can be anything that we want to draw an imaginary boundary around; it can be an automobile
engine, or a nuclear power plant, or a volume of gas emitted from a smokestack.
Later when we explore the topic of global temperature equilibrium, the system will
be the Earth itself. After a boundary has been defined, the rest of the universe becomes the surroundings. Just because a boundary has been defined, however, does
not mean that energy and/or materials cannot flow across that boundary. Systems in
which both energy and matter can flow across the boundary are referred to as open
systems, whereas those in which energy is allowed to flow across the boundary, but
matter is not, are called closed systems.
Since energy is conserved, we can write the following for whatever system we
have defined:
Total energy
Total energy
Total energy
Net change
- of mass
= of energy in
crossing boundary + of mass
P
Q P
Q P
Q P
Q
as heat and work
entering system
leaving system
the system

(46)

For closed systems, there is no movement of mass across the boundary, so the second
and third term drop out of the equation. The accumulation of energy represented by
the right side of (46) may cause changes in the observable, macroscopic forms of energy, such as kinetic and potential energies, or microscopic forms related to the
atomic and molecular structure of the system. Those microscopic forms of energy
include the kinetic energies of molecules and the energies associated with the forces
acting between molecules, between atoms within molecules, and within atoms. The
sum of those microscopic forms of energy is called the system’s internal energy and
is represented by the symbol U. The total energy E that a substance possesses can be
described then as the sum of its internal energy U, its kinetic energy KE, and its
potential energy PE:
E = U + KE + PE

22

(47)

Mass and Energy Transfer

In many applications of (46), the net energy added to a system will cause an increase in temperature. Waste heat from a power plant, for example, will raise the
temperature of cooling water drawn into its condenser. The amount of energy needed
to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by 1 degree is called the specific
heat. The specific heat of water is the basis for two important units of energy, namely
the British thermal unit (Btu), which is defined to be the energy required to raise 1 lb
of water by 1°F, and the kilocalorie, which is the energy required to raise 1 kg of
water by 1°C. In the definitions just given, the assumed temperature of the water is
15°C (59°F). Since kilocalories are no longer a preferred energy unit, values of specific heat in the SI system are given in kJ/kg°C, where 1 kcal/kg°C = 1 Btu/lb°F =
4.184 kJ/kg°C.
For most applications, the specific heat of a liquid or solid can be treated as a
simple quantity that varies slightly with temperature. For gases, on the other hand,
the concept of specific heat is complicated by the fact that some of the heat energy
absorbed by a gas may cause an increase in temperature, and some may cause the
gas to expand, doing work on its environment. That means it takes more energy to
raise the temperature of a gas that is allowed to expand than the amount needed if
the gas is kept at constant volume. The specific heat at constant volume cv is used
when a gas does not change volume as it is heated or cooled, or if the volume is allowed to vary but is brought back to its starting value at the end of the process.
Similarly, the specific heat at constant pressure cp applies for systems that do not
change pressure. For incompressible substances, that is, liquids and solids under the
usual circumstances, cv and cp are identical. For gases, cp is greater than cv.
The added complications associated with systems that change pressure and
volume are most easily handled by introducing another thermodynamic property of
a substance called enthalpy. The enthalpy H of a substance is defined as
H = U + PV

(48)

where U is its internal energy, P is its pressure, and V is its volume. The enthalpy of
a unit mass of a substance depends only on its temperature. It has energy units (kJ or
Btu) and historically was referred to as a system’s “heat content.” Since heat is correctly defined only in terms of energy transfer across a system’s boundaries, heat
content is a somewhat misleading descriptor and is not used much anymore.
When a process occurs without a change of volume, the relationship between
internal energy and temperature change is given by
¢ U = m cv ¢T

(49)

The analogous equation for changes that occur under constant pressure involves
enthalpy
¢ H = m cp ¢T

(50)

For many environmental systems, the substances being heated are solids or
liquids for which cv = cp = c and ¢U = ¢H. We can write the following equation
for the energy needed to raise the temperature of mass m by an amount ¢T:
Change in stored energy = m c ¢T

(51)

Table 3 provides some examples of specific heat for several selected substances. It is worth noting that water has by far the highest specific heat of the
substances listed; in fact, it is higher than almost all common substances. This is one

of water’s very unusual properties and is in large part responsible for the major effect the oceans have on moderating temperature variations of coastal areas.

EXAMPLE 10 A Water Heater
How long would it take to heat the water in a 40-gallon electric water heater
from 50°F to 140°F if the heating element delivers 5 kW? Assume all of the electrical energy is converted to heat in the water, neglect the energy required to raise
the temperature of the tank itself, and neglect any heat losses from the tank to the
environment.
Solution The first thing to note is that the electric input is expressed in kilowatts, which is a measure of the rate of energy input (i.e., power). To get total
energy delivered to the water, we must multiply rate by time. Letting ¢t be the
number of hours that the heating element is on gives
Energy input = 5 kW * ¢t hrs = 5¢t kWhr
Assuming no losses from the tank and no water withdrawn from the tank during
the heating period, there is no energy output:
Energy output = 0
The change in energy stored corresponds to the water warming from 50°F to
140°F. Using (51) along with the fact that water weighs 8.34 lb/gal gives
Change in stored energy = m c ¢T
= 40 gal * 8.34 lb/gal * 1 Btu/lb°F * (140 - 50)°F
= 30 * 103 Btu
Setting the energy input equal to the change in internal energy and converting
units using Table 1 yields
5¢t kWhr * 3,412 Btu/kWhr = 30 * 103 Btu
¢t = 1.76 hr

24

Mass and Energy Transfer

There are two key assumptions implicit in (51). First, the specific heat is
assumed to be constant over the temperature range in question, although in actuality
it does vary slightly. Second, (51) assumes that there is no change of phase as would
occur if the substance were to freeze or melt (liquid-solid phase change) or evaporate or condense (liquid-gas phase change).
When a substance changes phase, energy is absorbed or released without a
change in temperature. The energy required to cause a phase change of a unit mass
from solid to liquid (melting) at the same pressure is called the latent heat of fusion
or, more correctly, the enthalpy of fusion. Similarly, the energy required to change
phase from liquid to vapor at constant pressure is called the latent heat of vaporization or the enthalpy of vaporization. For example, 333 kJ will melt 1 kg of ice
(144 Btu/lb), whereas 2,257 kJ are required to convert 1 kg of water at 100°C to
steam (970 Btu/lb). When steam condenses or when water freezes, those same
amounts of energy are released. When a substance changes temperature as heat is
added, the process is referred to as sensible heating. When the addition of heat
causes a phase change, as is the case when ice is melting or water is boiling, the
addition is called latent heat. To account for the latent heat stored in a substance, we
can include the following in our energy balance:
Energy released or absorbed in phase change = m L

(52)

where m is the mass and L is the latent heat of fusion or vaporization.
Figure 13 illustrates the concepts of latent heat and specific heat for water as it
passes through its three phases from ice, to water, to steam.
Values of specific heat, heats of vaporization and fusion, and density for water
are given in Table 4 for both SI and USCS units. An additional entry has been
included in the table that shows the heat of vaporization for water at 15°C. This is
a useful number that can be used to estimate the amount of energy required to cause

surface water on the Earth to evaporate. The value of 15°C has been picked as the
starting temperature since that is approximately the current average surface temperature of the globe.
One way to demonstrate the concept of the heat of vaporization, while at the
same time introducing an important component of the global energy balance, is to
estimate the energy required to power the global hydrologic cycle.

EXAMPLE 11 Power for the Hydrologic Cycle
Global rainfall has been estimated to average about 1 m of water per year across
the entire 5.10 * 1014 m2 of the Earth’s surface. Find the energy required to
cause that much water to evaporate each year. Compare this to the estimated
2007 world energy consumption of 4.7 * 1017 kJ and compare it to the average
rate at which sunlight strikes the surface of the Earth, which is about 168 W/m2.
Solution In Table 4, the energy required to vaporize 1 kg of 15°C water
(roughly the average global temperature) is given as 2,465 kJ. The total energy
required to vaporize all of that water is
Increase in stored energy = 1 m/yr * 5.10 * 1014 m2 * 103 kg/m3 * 2,465 kJ/kg
= 1.25 * 1021 kJ/yr

This is roughly 2,700 times the 4.7 * 1017 kJ/yr of energy we use to power our
society.
Averaged over the globe, the energy required to power the hydrologic cycle is
1.25 * 1024 J/yr * 1

W
J/s

365 day/yr * 24 hr/day * 3,600 s/hr * 5.10 * 1014 m2

= 78.0 W/m2

which is equivalent to almost half of the 168 W/m2 of incoming sunlight striking
the Earth’s surface. It might also be noted that the energy required to raise the
water vapor high into the atmosphere after it has evaporated is negligible compared to the heat of vaporization (see Problem 27 at the end of this chapter).

Mass and Energy Transfer

Many practical environmental engineering problems involve the flow of both
matter and energy across system boundaries (open systems). For example, it is common for a hot liquid, usually water, to be used to deliver heat to a pollution control
process or, the opposite, for water to be used as a coolant to remove heat from a
process. In such cases, there are energy flow rates and fluid flow rates, and (51)
needs to be modified as follows:
#
Rate of change of stored energy = m c ¢T
(53)
#
where m is the mass flow rate across the system boundary, given by the product of
fluid flow rate and density, and ¢T is the change in temperature of the fluid that is
carrying the heat to, or away from, the process. For example, if water is being used
#
to cool a steam power plant, then m would be the mass flow rate of coolant, and ¢T
would be the increase in temperature of the cooling water as it passes through the
steam plant’s condenser. Typical units for energy rates include watts, Btu/hr, or kJ/s,
whereas mass flow rates might typically be in kg/s or lb/hr.
The use of a local river for power plant cooling is common, and the following
example illustrates the approach that can be taken to compute the increase in river
temperature that results.

EXAMPLE 12 Thermal Pollution of a River
A coal-fired power plant converts one-third of the coal’s energy into electrical
energy. The electrical power output of the plant is 1,000 MW. The other twothirds of the energy content of the fuel is rejected to the environment as waste
heat. About 15 percent of the waste heat goes up the smokestack, and the other
85 percent is taken away by cooling water that is drawn from a nearby river. The
river has an upstream flow of 100.0 m3/s and a temperature of 20.0°C.
a. If the cooling water is only allowed to rise in temperature by 10.0°C, what
flow rate from the stream would be required?
b. What would be the river temperature just after it receives the heated cooling water?
Solution Since 1,000 MW represents one-third of the power delivered to the
plant by fuel, the total rate at which energy enters the power plant is
Input power =

Output power
1,000 MWe
=
= 3,000 MWt
Efficiency
1>3

Notice the subscript on the input and output power in the preceding equation. To
help keep track of the various forms of energy, it is common to use MWt for
thermal power and MWe for electrical power.
Total losses to the cooling water and stack are therefore 3,000 MW - 1,000 MW =
2,000 MW. Of that 2,000 MW,
Stack losses = 0.15 * 2,000 MWt = 300 MWt

and
Coolant losses = 0.85 * 2,000 MWt = 1,700 MWt
a. Finding the cooling water needed to remove 1,700 MWt with a temperature increase ¢T of 10.0°C will require the use of (1.53) along with the
specific heat of water, 4,184 J/kg°C,given in Table 4:
#
Rate of change in internal energy = m c ¢T
#
1,700 MWt = m kg/s * 4,184 J/kg°C * 10.0°C * 1 MW>(106 J/s)
#
m =

1,700
4,184 * 10.0 * 10-6

= 40.6 * 103 kg/s

or, since 1,000 kg equals 1 m3 of water, the flow rate is 40.6 m3/s.
b. To find the new temperature of the river, we can use (53) with 1,700 MWt
being released into the river, which again has a flow rate of 100.0 m3/s.
#
Rate of change in internal energy = m c ¢T
1,700 MW * a
¢T =

1 * 106 J/s
b
MW

100.00 m3/s * 103 kg/m3 * 4,184 J/kg°C

= 4.1°C

so the temperature of the river will be elevated by 4.1°C making it 24.1°C.
The results of the calculations just performed are shown in Figure 14.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics
In Example 12, you will notice that a relatively modest fraction of the fuel energy
contained in the coal actually was converted to the desired output, electrical power,
and a rather large amount of the fuel energy ended up as waste heat rejected to
the environment. The second law of thermodynamics says that there will always
be some waste heat; that is, it is impossible to devise a machine that can convert heat

to work with 100 percent efficiency. There will always be “losses” (although, by the
first law, the energy is not lost, it is merely converted into the lower quality, less useful form of low-temperature heat).
The steam-electric plant just described is an example of a heat engine, a device
studied at some length in thermodynamics. One way to view the steam plant is that
it is a machine that takes heat from a high-temperature source (the burning fuel),
converts some of it into work (the electrical output), and rejects the remainder into
a low-temperature reservoir (the river and the atmosphere). It turns out that the
maximum efficiency that our steam plant can possibly have depends on how high
the source temperature is and how low the temperature is of the reservoir accepting
the rejected heat. It is analogous to trying to run a turbine using water that flows
from a higher elevation to a lower one. The greater the difference in elevation, the
more power can be extracted.
Figure 15 shows a theoretical heat engine operating between two heat reservoirs, one at temperature Th and one at Tc. An amount of heat energy Qh is transferred from the hot reservoir to the heat engine. The engine does work W and rejects
an amount of waste heat Qc to the cold reservoir.
The efficiency of this engine is the ratio of the work delivered by the engine to
the amount of heat energy taken from the hot reservoir:
Efficiency h =

W
Qh

(54)

The most efficient heat engine that could possibly operate between the two
heat reservoirs is called a Carnot engine after the French engineer Sadi Carnot, who
first developed the explanation in the 1820s. Analysis of Carnot engines shows that
the most efficient engine possible, operating between two temperatures, Th and Tc,
has an efficiency of
h max = 1 -

FIGURE 16 A fuel-fired, steam-electric power plant.

One immediate observation that can be made from (55) is that the maximum
possible heat engine efficiency increases as the temperature of the hot reservoir
increases or the temperature of the cold reservoir decreases. In fact, since neither infinitely hot temperatures nor absolute zero temperatures are possible, we must conclude that no real engine has 100 percent efficiency, which is just a restatement of
the second law.
Equation (55) can help us understand the seemingly low efficiency of thermal
power plants such as the one diagrammed in Figure 16. In this plant, fuel is burned
in a firing chamber surrounded by metal tubing. Water circulating through this boiler tubing is converted to high-pressure, high-temperature steam. During this conversion of chemical to thermal energy, losses on the order of 10 percent occur due to
incomplete combustion and loss of heat up the smokestack. Later, we shall consider
local and regional air pollution effects caused by these emissions as well as their possible role in global warming.
The steam produced in the boiler then enters a steam turbine, which is in some
ways similar to a child’s pinwheel. The high-pressure steam expands as it passes
through the turbine blades, causing a shaft that is connected to the generator to
spin. Although the turbine in Figure 16 is shown as a single unit, in actuality, turbines have many stages with steam exiting one stage and entering another, gradually
expanding and cooling as it goes. The generator converts the rotational energy of a
spinning shaft into electrical power that goes out onto transmission lines for distribution. A well-designed turbine may have an efficiency that approaches 90 percent,
whereas the generator may have a conversion efficiency even higher than that.
The spent steam from the turbine undergoes a phase change back to the liquid
state as it is cooled in the condenser. This phase change creates a partial vacuum that
helps pull steam through the turbine, thereby increasing the turbine efficiency. The
condensed steam is then pumped back to the boiler to be reheated.
The heat released when the steam condenses is transferred to cooling water
that circulates through the condenser. Usually, cooling water is drawn from a lake or
river, heated in the condenser, and returned to that body of water, which is called
once-through cooling. A more expensive approach, which has the advantage of

30

Mass and Energy Transfer

requiring less water, involves the use of cooling towers that transfer the heat directly
into the atmosphere rather than into a receiving body of water. In either case, the rejected heat is released into the environment. In terms of the heat engine concept
shown in Figure 15, the cold reservoir temperature is thus determined by the temperature of the environment.
Let us estimate the maximum possible efficiency that a thermal power plant
such as that diagrammed in Figure 16 can have. A reasonable estimate of Th might
be the temperature of the steam from the boiler, which is typically around 600°C.
For Tc, we might use an ambient temperature of about 20°C. Using these values in
(55) and remembering to convert temperatures to the absolute scale, gives
h max = 1 -

(20 + 273)
= 0.66 = 66 percent
(600 + 273)

New fossil fuel-fired power plants have efficiencies around 40 percent. Nuclear
plants have materials constraints that force them to operate at somewhat lower temperatures than fossil plants, which results in efficiencies of around 33 percent. The
average efficiency of all thermal plants actually in use in the United States, including
new and old (less efficient) plants, fossil and nuclear, is close to 33 percent. That
suggests the following convenient rule of thumb:
For every 3 units of energy entering the average thermal power plant,
approximately 1 unit is converted to electricity and 2 units are rejected
to the environment as waste heat.
The following example uses this rule of thumb for power plant efficiency combined with other emission factors to develop a mass and energy balance for a typical
coal-fired power plant.

EXAMPLE 13 Mass and Energy Balance for a Coal-Fired Power Plant
Typical coal burned in power plants in the United States has an energy content of
approximately 24 kJ/g and an average carbon content of about 62 percent. For
almost all new coal plants, Clean Air Act emission standards limit sulfur emissions to 260 g of sulfur dioxide (SO2) per million kJ of heat input to the plant
(130 g of elemental sulfur per 106 kJ). They also restrict particulate emissions to
13 g>106 kJ. Suppose the average plant burns fuel with 2 percent sulfur content
and 10 percent unburnable minerals called ash. About 70 percent of the ash is
released as fly ash, and about 30 percent settles out of the firing chamber and is
collected as bottom ash. Assume this is a typical coal plant with 3 units of heat
energy required to deliver 1 unit of electrical energy.
a. Per kilowatt-hour of electrical energy produced, find the emissions of SO2,
particulates, and carbon (assume all of the carbon in the coal is released to
the atmosphere).
b. How efficient must the sulfur emission control system be to meet the sulfur
emission limitations?
c. How efficient must the particulate control system be to meet the particulate
emission limits?

31

Mass and Energy Transfer

Solution
a. We first need the heat input to the plant. Because 3 kWhr of heat are
required for each 1 kWhr of electricity delivered,
Heat input
kWhr electricity

= 3 kWhr heat *

1 kJ/s
* 3,600 s/hr = 10,800 kJ
kW

The sulfur emissions are thus restricted to
S emissions =

130 g S
106 kJ

* 10,800 kJ/kWhr = 1.40 g S/kWhr

The molecular weight of SO2 is 32 + 2 * 16 = 64, half of which is sulfur.
Thus, 1.4 g of S corresponds to 2.8 g of SO2, so 2.8 g SO2/kWhr would be
emitted. Particulate emissions need to be limited to:
Particulate emissions =

13 g
106 kJ

* 10,800 kJ/kWhr = 0.14 g/kWhr

To find carbon emissions, first find the amount of coal burned per kWhr
Coal input =

10,800 kJ/kWhr
= 450 g coal/kWhr
24 kJ/g coal

Therefore, since the coal is 62 percent carbon
Carbon emissions =

0.62 g C
450 g coal
*
= 280 g C/kWhr
g coal
kWhr

b. Burning 450 g coal containing 2 percent sulfur will release 0.02 * 450 =
9.0 g of S. Since the allowable emissions are 1.4 g, the removal efficiency
must be
S removal efficiency = 1 -

1.4
= 0.85 = 85 percent
9.0

c. Since 10 percent of the coal is ash, and 70 percent of that is fly ash, the total
fly ash generated will be
Fly ash generated = 0.70 * 0.10 * 450 g coal/kWhr
= 31.5 g fly ash/kWhr
The allowable particulate matter is restricted to 0.14 g/kWhr, so controls
must be installed that have the following removal efficiency:
Particulate removal efficiency = 1 -

0.14
= 0.995 = 99.5 percent
31.5

The complete mass and energy balance for this coal plant is diagrammed in
Figure 17. In this diagram, it has been assumed that 85 percent of the waste heat
is removed by cooling water, and the remaining 15 percent is lost in stack gases
(corresponding to the conditions given in Example 12).

The Carnot efficiency limitation provides insight into the likely performance
of other types of thermal power plants in addition to the steam plants just described.
For example, there have been many proposals to build power plants that would take
advantage of the temperature difference between the relatively warm surface waters
of the ocean and the rather frigid waters found below. In some locations, the sun
heats the ocean’s top layer to as much as 30°C, whereas several hundred meters
down, the temperature is a constant 4 or 5°C. Power plants, called ocean thermal
energy conversion (OTEC) systems, could be designed to operate on these small
temperature differences in the ocean; however, as the following example shows, they
would be inefficient.
EXAMPLE 14 OTEC System Efficiency
Consider an OTEC system operating between 30°C and 5°C. What would be the
maximum possible efficiency for an electric generating station operating with
these temperatures?
Solution

Using (55), we find
h max = 1 -

(5 + 273)
= 0.08 = 8 percent
(30 + 273)

An even lower efficiency, estimated at 2 to 3 percent for a real plant, would be
expected.

Conductive and Convective Heat Transfer
When two objects are at different temperatures, heat will be transferred from the
hotter object to the colder one. That heat transfer can be by conduction, by
convection, or by radiation, which can take place even in the absence of any physical medium between the objects.

FIGURE 18 Heat transfer through a simple wall.

Conductive heat transfer is usually associated with solids, as one molecule
vibrates the next in the lattice. The rate of heat transfer in a solid is proportional
to the thermal conductivity of the material. Metals tend to be good thermal conductors, which makes them very useful when high heat-transfer rates are desired. Other
materials are much less so, with some being particularly poor thermal conductors,
which makes them potentially useful as thermal insulation.
Convective heat transfer occurs when a fluid at one temperature comes in contact with a substance at another temperature. For example, warm air in a house in
the winter that comes in contact with a cool wall surface will transfer heat to the
wall. As that warm air loses some of its heat, it becomes cooler and denser, and it will
sink and be replaced by more warm air from the interior of the room. Thus there is
a continuous movement of air around the room and with it a transference of heat
from the warm room air to the cool wall. The cool wall, in turn, conducts heat to the
cold exterior surface of the house where outside air removes the heat by convection.
Figure 18 illustrates the two processes of convection and conduction through a
hypothetical wall. In addition, there is radiative heat transfer from objects in the
room to the wall, and from the wall to the ambient outside. It is conventional practice to combine all three processes into a single, overall heat-transfer process that is
characterized by the following simple equation:
q =

A(Ti - To)
R

(58)

where
q ⫽ heat transfer rate through the wall (W) or (Btu/hr)
A ⫽ wall area (m2) or (ft2)
Ti = air temperature on one side of the wall (°C) or (°F)
To = ambient air temperature (°C) or (°F)
R = overall thermal resistance (m2-°C/W) or (hr-ft2-°F/Btu)
The overall thermal resistance R is called the R-value. If you buy insulation at the
hardware store, it will be designated as having an R-value in the American unit
system (hr-ft2-°F/Btu). For example, 31⁄2-inch-thick fiberglass insulation is usually
marked R-11, whereas 6 inches of the same material is R-19.

34

Mass and Energy Transfer

As the following example illustrates, improving the efficiency with which we
use energy can save money as well as reduce emissions of pollutants associated with
energy consumption. This important connection between energy efficiency and
pollution control has in the past been overlooked and underappreciated. However,
that situation has been changing. The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, for
example, provide SO2 emission credits for energy efficiency projects.

EXAMPLE 15 Reducing Pollution by Adding Ceiling Insulation
A home with 1,500 ft2 of poorly insulated ceiling is located in an area with an
8-month heating season during which time the outdoor temperature averages
40°F while the inside temperature is kept at 70°F (this could be Chicago, for
example). It has been proposed to the owner that $1,000 be spent to add more insulation to the ceiling, raising its total R-value from 11 to 40 (ft2-°F-hr/Btu). The
house is heated with electricity that costs 8 cents/kWhr.
a. How much money would the owner expect to save each year, and how long
would it take for the energy savings to pay for the cost of insulation?
b. Suppose 1 million homes served by coal plants like the one analyzed in
Example 13 could achieve similar energy savings. Estimate the annual reduction in SO2, particulate, and carbon emissions that would be realized.
Solution
a. Using (58) to find the heat loss rate with the existing insulation gives
q =

A(Ti - To)
1,500 ft2 * (70 - 40)°F
=
= 4,090 Btu/hr
R
11 (ft2-°F-hr/Btu)

After adding the insulation, the new heat loss rate will be
q =

A(Ti - To)
1,500 ft2 * (70 - 40)°F
=
= 1,125 Btu/hr
R
40 (ft2-°F-hr/Btu)

The annual energy savings can be found by multiplying the rate at which energy is being saved by the number of hours in the heating season. If we assume
the electric heating system in the house is 100 percent efficient at converting
electricity to heat (reasonable) and that it delivers all of that heat to the spaces
that need heat (less reasonable, especially if there are heating ducts, which
tend to leak), then we can use the conversion 3,412 Btu = 1 kWhr.
Energy saved =

(4,090 - 1,125) Btu/hr

3,412 Btu/kWhr
= 5,005 kWhr/yr

* 24 hr/day * 30 day/mo * 8 mo/yr

The annual savings in dollars would be
Dollar savings = 5,005 kWhr/yr * $0.08/kWhr = $400/yr
Since the estimated cost of adding extra insulation is $1,000, the reduction
in electricity bills would pay for this investment in about 21⁄2 heating seasons.

35

Mass and Energy Transfer

b. One million such houses would save a total of 5 billion kWhr/yr (nearly
the entire annual output of a typical 1,000 MWe power plant). Using the
emission factors derived in Example 13, the reduction in air emissions
would be
Carbon reduction = 280 g C/kWhr * 5 * 109 kWhr/yr * 10-3 kg/g
= 1,400 * 106 kg/yr
SO2 reduction = 2.8 g SO2/kWhr * 5 * 109 kWhr/yr * 10-3 kg/g
= 14 * 106 kg/yr
Particulate reduction = 0.14 g/kWhr * 5 * 109 kWhr/yr * 10-3 kg/g
= 0.7 * 106 kg/yr

Radiant Heat Transfer
Heat transfer by thermal radiation is the third way that one object can warm another.
Unlike conduction and convection, radiant energy is transported by electromagnetic
waves and does not require a medium to carry the energy. As is the case for other
forms of electromagnetic phenomena, such as radio waves, x-rays, and gamma rays,
thermal radiation can be described either in terms of wavelengths or, using the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation, in terms of discrete photons of energy. All
electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light. They can be described by their
wavelength or their frequency, and the two are related as follows:
c = ln
where
c ⫽ speed of light (3 * 108 m/s)
l = wavelength (m)
n = frequency (hertz, i.e., cycles per second)

(59)

When radiant energy is described in terms of photons, the relationship between
frequency and energy is given by
E = hn
where
E ⫽ energy of a photon (J)
h ⫽ Planck’s constant (6.6 * 10 - 34 J-s)

(60)

Equation (60) points out that higher-frequency, shorter-wavelength photons have
higher energy content, which makes them potentially more dangerous when living
things are exposed to them.
Consider the effects of various gases on global climate and depletion of
the stratospheric ozone layer. The wavelengths of importance in that context are
roughly in the range of about 0.1 mm up to about 100 mm (1 mm is 10 - 6 m, also
called 1 micron). For perspective, Figure 19 shows a portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum.
Every object emits thermal radiation. The usual way to describe how much
radiation a real object emits, as well as other characteristics of the wavelengths

emitted, is to compare it to a theoretical abstraction called a blackbody. A blackbody is defined as a perfect emitter as well as a perfect absorber. As a perfect emitter, it radiates more energy per unit of surface area than any real object at the same
temperature. As a perfect absorber, it absorbs all radiation that impinges upon it;
that is, none is reflected, and none is transmitted through it. Actual objects do not
emit as much radiation as this hypothetical blackbody, but most are close to this theoretical limit. The ratio of the amount of radiation an actual object would emit to
the amount that a blackbody would emit at the same temperature is known as the
emissivity, e. The emissivity of desert sand, dry ground, and most woodlands is estimated to be approximately 0.90, whereas water, wet sand, and ice all have estimated
emissivities of roughly 0.95. A human body, no matter what pigmentation, has an
emissivity of around 0.96.
The wavelengths radiated by a blackbody depend on its temperature, as
described by Planck’s law:

lengths emitted, have as their vertical axis an amount of power per unit-wavelength.
The way to interpret such spectral diagrams is to realize that the area under the
curve between any two wavelengths is equal to the power radiated by the object
within that band of wavelengths. Hence the total area under the curve is equal to the
total power radiated. Objects at higher temperatures emit more power and, as the
figure suggests, their peak intensity occurs at shorter wavelengths.
Extraterrestrial solar radiation (just outside the Earth’s atmosphere) shows
spectral characteristics that are well approximated by blackbody radiation. Although
the temperature deep within the sun is many millions of degrees, its effective surface
temperature is about 5,800 K. Figure 21 shows the close match between the actual
solar spectrum and that of a 5,800-K blackbody.
As has already been mentioned, the area under a spectral curve between any
two wavelengths is the total power radiated by those wavelengths. For the solar
spectrum of Figure 21, the area under the curve between 0.38 and 0.78 mm (the
wavelengths visible to the human eye) is 47 percent of the total area. That is, 47 percent of the solar energy striking the outside of our atmosphere is in the visible portion of the spectrum. The ultraviolet range contains 7 percent of the energy, and the
infrared wavelengths deliver the remaining 46 percent. The total area under the
solar spectrum curve is called the solar constant, and it is estimated to be 1,372 watts
per m2. The solar constant plays an important role in determining the surface temperature of the Earth.
The equation describing Planck’s law (61) is somewhat tricky to manipulate,
especially for calculations involving the area under a spectral curve. Two other radiation equations, however, are straightforward and are often all that is needed. The
first, known as the Stefan-Boltzmann law of radiation, gives the total radiant energy
emitted by a blackbody with surface area A and absolute temperature T:
E = sAT 4
where
E ⫽ total blackbody emission rate (W)
s ⫽ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant = 5.67 * 10 - 8 W/m2-K4
T = absolute temperature (K)
A = surface area of the object (m2)

EXAMPLE 16 The Earth’s Spectrum
Consider the Earth to be a blackbody with average temperature 15°C and surface
area equal to 5.1 * 1014 m2. Find the rate at which energy is radiated by the
Earth and the wavelength at which maximum power is radiated. Compare this
peak wavelength with that for a 5,800-K blackbody (the sun).
Solution

Using (62), the Earth radiates

E = sAT 4
= 5.67 * 10-8 W/m2-K4 * 5.1 * 1014 m2 * (15.0 + 273.15 K)4
= 2.0 * 1017 Watts

This tremendous rate of energy emission by the Earth is balanced by the rate at
which the Earth absorbs energy from the sun. As shown in Example 16, however, the
solar energy striking the Earth has much shorter wavelengths than energy radiated
back to space by the Earth. This wavelength shift plays a crucial role in the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are relatively transparent
to the incoming short wavelengths from the sun, but they tend to absorb the outgoing, longer wavelengths radiated by the Earth. As those greenhouse gases accumulate in our atmosphere, they act like a blanket that envelops the planet, upsets the
radiation balance, and raises the Earth’s temperature.

Plateau Creek carries 5.0 m3/s of water with a selenium (Se) concentration of 0.0015 mg/L.
A farmer starts withdrawing 1.0 m3/s of the creek water to irrigate the land. During irrigation, the water picks up selenium from the salts in the soil. One-half of the irrigation
water is lost to the ground and plants, and the other half is returned to Plateau Creek. The
irrigation run-off to the creek contains 1.00 mg/L of selenium. Selenium is a conservative,
nonreactive substance (it does not degrade in the stream), and the stream does not pick up
more selenium from any other source.

selenium in the stream downstream from the farm (after the irrigation run-off returns

A lagoon is to be designed to accomodate an input flow of 0.10 m3/s of nonconservative
pollutant with concentration 30.0 mg/L and reaction rate 0.20/day. The effluent from the

Ozone is sometimes used as a disinfectant for drinking water. Ozone is highly reactive.
It will react with many benign species found in water, as well as the pathogens it is intended to kill. It is found that ozone reaction in water nearly follows first-order kinetics
in ozone concentration, such that its concentration decreases by 50 percent in 12 minutes
(t1>2 = 12 min). A water supplier wants to inject ozone into a pipe bringing water to the
water treatment plant to predisinfect the influent. The 3.0-ft. diameter pipe is 3,400 feet
long with a steady flow rate of 10,000 gal/min. What concentration of ozone (in mg/L)
should be injected at the head of the pipe so that there will be an ozone concentration of
1.0 mg/L at the pipe’s exit into the plant? The pipe may be realistically assumed to act as
an ideal PFR.
Your stomach is a chemical reactor. When you devour a fast food 99¢ special hamburger
in about a minute, it acts like an instantaneous input of 325 g of food entering the stomach. In response, the stomach starts producing gastric liquids (acids), which are continuously excreted into the stomach at a rate of 12.0 mL/min as the hamburger is digested.
The fluid also leaves the stomach to the small intestine at a flow rate of 12.0 mL/min, so
the volume of liquid in the stomach stays constant at 1.15 L. The hamburger digestion
rate constant is 1.33 hr - 1.
(a) What kind of ideal reactor would you model your stomach as?
(b) What fraction of the hamburger’s mass will remain undigested in your stomach
one hour after you eat the hamburger?
A simple way to model air pollution over a city is with a box model that assumes complete mixing and limited capability for the pollution to disperse horizontally or vertically
except in the direction of the prevailing winds (for example, a town located in a valley

with an inversion layer above it). Consider a town having an inversion at 250 m, a 20-km
horizontal distance perpendicular to the wind, a windspeed of 2 m/s, and a carbon
monoxide (CO) emission rate of 60 kg/s (see Figure P16). Assume the CO is conservative
and completely mixed in the box.

Consider the air over a city to be a box 100 km on a side that reaches up to an altitude of
1.0 km. Clean air is blowing into the box along one of its sides with a speed of 4 m/s. Suppose an air pollutant with reaction rate k = 0.20/hr is emitted into the box at a total rate of
10.0 kg/s. Find the steady-state concentration if the air is assumed to be completely mixed.
If the windspeed in Problem 17 suddenly drops to 1 m/s, estimate the concentration of
pollutants two hours later.
A lagoon with volume 1,200 m3 has been receiving a steady flow of a conservative waste
at a rate of 100 m3/day for a long enough time to assume that steady-state conditions
apply. The waste entering the lagoon has a concentration of 10 mg/L. Assuming completely mixed conditions,
(a) What would be the concentration of pollutant in the effluent leaving the lagoon?
(b) If the input waste concentration suddenly increased to 100 mg/L, what would the
concentration in the effluent be 7 days later?
Repeat Problem 19 for a nonconservative pollutant with reaction rate k = 0.20/d.
A nuclear power station is situated in Coal Valley, which is a roughly rectangular valley
that is 5 km long, 2 km wide, and 200 m deep. You have been asked to evaluate the effects
of a worst-case scenario where the reactor housing fails, and radiation is released to the
atmosphere. In your evaluation, you determine that 120 kg of Iodine-131 (a radioisotope
that causes thyroid gland and liver damage) could be released into the atmosphere.
(a) Assuming the release of Iodine-131 was very rapid and all of it was uniformly distributed through the valley’s atmosphere with none escaping the valley, what would
the concentration of Iodine-131 be in the valley’s air? Your answer should be expressed in units of ppmv, and you may assume an atmopheric pressure of 1.0 atm and
a temperature of 20°C.
(b) Assuming the Iodine-131 concentration you calculated in part (a) is the initial concentration in the valley, you now want to determine the time it will take for the concentration to decrease to the safe limit of 1.0 * 10 - 5 ppmv. The average windspeed
through the valley (entering at one end and exiting at the other) is only 1.5 m/min.
However, Iodine-131 also is removed by two other processes: 1) radioactive decay

with a half life of 8.1 days, and 2) sedimentation to the ground with a rate constant
of 0.02 d - 1. Draw a picture of the situation, and label the appropriate variables.

(c) Now derive an equation that expresses the concentration of Iodine-131 in the valley’s
air as a function of the time since the accident. Use the equation to determine the time
needed for the concentration to decrease to a safe level.
When a strong acid is added to water, it completely dissociates its protons (H + ). For
example, the dissociation of sulfuric acid in water is
H2SO4 + H2O : 2H + + SO24 + H2O
Or more simply:
H2SO4 : 2H + + SO24

(P1)

A similar type of reaction occurs if a strong base is added to water, except hydroxide
ions (OH - ) are dissociated. For example, the dissociation of the strong base, sodium
hydroxide (NaOH), in water is
NaOH + H2O : OH- + H2O + Na +
Or more simply:
(P2)

NaOH : OH- + Na +

When both a strong acid and a strong base are added to water together, the protons from
the acid react with the hydroxides from the base to produce more water molecules until
the supply of either excess protons or hydroxides is used up. The reaction is

to the flask’s water at the same instant, what will be the half-life of the added protons

Fifty percent of that sunlight is captured by the collector and heats the water flowing

An uncovered swimming pool loses 1.0 in of water off of its 1,000 ft2 surface each week due
to evaporation. The heat of vaporization for water at the pool temperature is 1,050 Btu/lb.
The cost of energy to heat the pool is $10.00 per million Btu. A salesman claims that a $500
pool cover that reduces evaporizative losses by two-thirds will pay for itself in one 15-week
swimming season. Can it be true?
Two-thirds of the energy content of fuel entering a 1,000-MWe nuclear power plant is
removed by condenser cooling water that is withdrawn from a local river (there are no
stack losses, as is the case for a fossil fuel-fired plant). The river has an upstream flow of
100 m3/s and a temperature of 20°C.
(a) If the cooling water is only allowed to rise in temperature by 10°C, what flow rate
from the river would be required? Compare it to the coal plant in Example 12.
(b) How much would the river temperature rise as it receives the heated cooling water?
Again, compare it to Example 12.
Consider a 354-mL can of soda cold enough to cause moisture from the air to condense on

is transferred into the soda, how much would the soda temperature increase? Assume the
density and specific heat of the soda are the same as water, neglect the thermal capacitance
of the can itself, and use 2,500 kJ/kg as the latent heat of vaporization (condensation).
Compare the energy required to evaporate a kilogram of water at 15°C to that required to
raise it 3 km into the air. (Recall that 1 kg on Earth weighs 9.8 N, and 1 J = 1 N-m.)
Compare the potential energy represented by 1 lb of water vapor at 59°F (15°C) and an
elevation of 5,000 ft to the energy that would be released when it condenses into rain
(1 Btu = 778 ft-lb).
A 600-MWe power plant has an efficiency of 36 percent with 15 percent of the waste heat
being released to the atmosphere as stack heat and the other 85 percent taken away in the

to the atmosphere as cooling water is vaporized.

replaces incandescents and the electricity comes from the coal-fired power plant described

Suppose a utility generates electricity with a 36 percent efficient coal-fired power plant
emitting the legal limit of 0.6 lb of SO2 per million Btus of heat into the plant. Suppose

(b) How many 2,000-lb tons of SO2 would not be emitted?

No. 6 fuel oil has a carbon content of 20 kg carbon per 109 J. If it is burned in a 40 percent efficient power plant, find the carbon emissions per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced, assuming all of the carbon in the fuel is released into the atmosphere. By law, new

It often matters much how given atoms combine, in what arrangement, with
what others, what impulse they receive, and what impart. The same ones make

but mingling and moving in ever different ways.

1 Introduction
Almost every pollution problem that we face has a chemical basis. Even the most
qualitative descriptions of such problems as the greenhouse effect, ozone depletion,
toxic wastes, groundwater contamination, air pollution, and acid rain, to mention a
few, require at least a rudimentary understanding of some basic chemical concepts.
And, of course, an environmental engineer who must design an emission control
system or a waste treatment plant must be well grounded in chemical principles and
the techniques of chemical engineering. In this brief chapter, the topics have been
selected with the goal of providing only the essential chemical principles required to
understand the nature of the pollution problems that we face and the engineering
approaches to their solutions.

Stoichiometry
When a chemical reaction is written down, it provides both qualitative and quantitative information. Qualitatively, we can see which chemicals are interacting to produce which end products. Quantitatively, the principle of conservation of mass can
be applied to give information about how much of each compound is involved to
produce the results shown. The balancing of equations so that the same number of
each kind of atom appears on each side of the equation and the subsequent calculations, which can be used to determine amounts of each compound involved, is
known as stoichiometry.
The first step is to balance the equation. For example, suppose we want to investigate the combustion of methane (CH4), the principal component of natural gas
and a major greenhouse gas. Methane combines with oxygen to produce carbon
dioxide and water as the following reaction suggests:
CH4 + O2 : CO2 + H2O
The equation is not balanced. One atom of carbon appears on each side,
which is fine, but there are four atoms of hydrogen on the left and only two on the
right, and there are only two atoms of oxygen on the left while there are three on
the right. We might try to double the water molecules on the right to balance the
hydrogen on each side, but then there would be an imbalance of oxygen with two
on the left and four on the right. So try doubling the oxygen on the left. This sort of
trial-and-error approach to balancing simple reactions usually converges pretty
quickly. In this instance, the following is a balanced equation with the same number
of C, H, and O atoms on each side of the arrow:
CH4 + 2 O2 : CO2 + 2 H2O

(1)

This balanced chemical equation can be read as: One molecule of methane
reacts with two molecules of oxygen to produce one molecule of carbon dioxide and
two molecules of water. It is of more use, however, to be able to describe this reaction in terms of the mass of each substance, that is, how many grams of oxygen are
required to react with how many grams of methane, and so on. To do so requires
that we know something about the mass of individual atoms and molecules.
The atomic weight of an atom is the mass of the atom measured in atomic
mass units (amu) where one amu is defined to be exactly one-twelfth the mass of a
carbon atom having six protons and six neutrons in its nucleus. Although this might
suggest that if we look up the atomic weight of carbon, we would expect to find it
to be exactly 12 amu, that is not the case. All carbon atoms do have six protons, but
they do not all have six neutrons, so they do not all have the same atomic weight.
Atoms having the same number of protons but differing numbers of neutrons are
called isotopes. What is reported in tables of atomic weights, is the average based on
the relative abundance of different isotopes found in nature. The atomic number is
the number of protons in the nucleus. All isotopes of a given element have the same
atomic number.

Environmental Chemistry

The molecular weight of a molecule is simply the sum of the atomic weights
of all of the constituent atoms. If we divide the mass of a substance by its molecular
weight, the result is the mass expressed in moles (mol). Usually the mass is expressed
in grams, in which case 1 mole contains 6.02 * 1023 molecules (Avogadro’s
number).
Moles =

Mass (g)

(2)

Molecular weight

The special advantage of expressing amounts in moles is that 1 mole of any
substance contains exactly the same number of molecules, which gives us another
way to interpret a chemical equation. Consider (1), repeated here:
CH4 + 2 O2 : CO2 + 2 H2O
On a molecular level, we can say that 1 molecule of methane reacts with 2 molecules
of oxygen to produce 1 molecule of carbon dioxide and 2 molecules of water. On a
larger (and more environmentally relevant) scale, we can say that 1 mole of methane
reacts with 2 moles of oxygen to produce 1 mole of carbon dioxide and 2 moles of
water. Because we know how many grams are contained in each mole, we can
express our mass balance in those terms as well.
To express the preceding methane reaction in grams, we need first to find the
number of grams per mole for each substance. The atomic weight of C is 12, H is 1,
and O is 16. Notice that these values have been rounded slightly, which is common
engineering practice. Thus, the molecular weights and hence the number of grams
per mole, are
CH4 = 12 + 4 * 1
O2 = 2 * 16

= 16 g/mol
= 32 g/mol

CO2 = 12 + 2 * 16 = 44 g/mol
H2O = 2 * 1 + 16

= 18 g/mol

Summarizing these various ways to express the oxidation of methane, we can say

Environmental Chemistry

EXAMPLE 1 Combustion of Butane
What mass of carbon dioxide would be produced if 100 g of butane (C4H10) is
completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water?
Solution

First write down the reaction:
C4H10 + O2 : CO2 + H2O

then balance it
2 C4H10 + 13 O2 : 8 CO2 + 10 H2O
Find the grams per mole for butane:
C4H10 = 4 * 12 + 10 * 1 = 58 g/mol
We already know that there are 44 grams per mole of CO2, so we don’t need to
recalculate that. Two moles of butane (2 mol * 58 g/mol = 116 g) yields 8 moles
of carbon dioxide (8 mol * 44 g/mol = 352 g CO2). So, we can set up the following proportion:
116 g C4H10
100 g C4H10
=
352 g CO2
X g CO2
Thus,
X = 100 * 352>116 = 303 g of CO2 produced
Many environmental problems involve concentrations of substances dissolved
in water. We introduce two common sets of units: mg/L and ppm. However, it is also
useful to express concentrations in terms of molarity, which is simply the number of
moles of substance per liter of solution. A 1 molar (1 M) solution has 1 mole of substance dissolved into enough water to make the mixture have a volume of 1 L.
Molarity is related to mg/L concentrations by the following:
mg/L = Molarity (mol/L) * Molecular Weight (g/mol) * 103 (mg/g)

(3)

The following example illustrates the use of molarity, and at the same time,
introduces another important concept having to do with the amount of oxygen
required to oxidize a given substance.
EXAMPLE 2 Theoretical Oxygen Demand
Consider a 1.67 * 10-3 M glucose solution (C6H12O6) that is completely oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Find the amount of oxygen required to complete the
reaction.
Solution To find the oxygen required to completely oxidize this glucose, we
first write a balanced equation, determine molecular weights, and find the mass
of each constituent in the reaction:
C6H12O6
+
6 O2
:
6 CO2
+
6 H2O
6 * 12 + 12 * 1 + 6 * 16 = 180
6 * 32 = 192
6 * 44 = 264
6 * 18 = 108

50

Environmental Chemistry

Thus it takes 192 g of oxygen to oxidize 180 g of glucose. From (3), the concentration of glucose is
mg/L = 1.67 * 10 - 3 mol/L * 180 g/mol * 103 mg/g = 301 mg/L
so the oxygen requirement would be
300 mg/L glucose *

192 g O2
180 g glucose

= 321 mg/L O2

If the chemical composition of a substance is known, then the amount of oxygen required to oxidize it to carbon dioxide and water can be calculated using stoichiometry, as was done in the preceding example. That oxygen requirement is
known as the theoretical oxygen demand. If that oxidation is carried out by bacteria
using the substance for food, then the amount of oxygen required is known as the
biochemical oxygen demand or BOD. The BOD will be somewhat less than the theoretical oxygen demand because some of the original carbon is incorporated into
bacterial cell tissue rather than being oxidized to carbon dioxide. Oxygen demand is
an important measure of the likely impact that wastes will have on a receiving body
of water.
The convenience of using moles to describe amounts of substances also helps
when calculating atmospheric concentrations of pollutants. It was Avogadro’s
hypothesis, made in 1811, that equal volumes of all gases, at a specified temperature
and pressure, contain equal numbers of molecules. In fact, since 1 mole of any substance has Avogadro’s number of molecules, it follows that 1 mole of gas, at a specified temperature and volume, will occupy a predictable volume. At standard
temperature and pressure (STP), corresponding to 0°C and 1 atm. (760 mm of
mercury, 101.3 kPa), 1 mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 L, or 0.0224 m3, and contains 6.02 * 1023 molecules.
Let us demonstrate the usefulness of Avogadro’s hypothesis for gases by applying it to a very modern concern; that is, the rate at which we are pouring carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere as we burn up our fossil fuels.

EXAMPLE 3 Carbon Emissions from Natural Gas
Worldwide combustion of methane, CH4 (natural gas), provides about 10.9 *
1016 kJ of energy per year. If methane has an energy content of 39 * 103 kJ/m3
(at STP), what mass of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere each year? Also,
express that emission rate as metric tons of carbon (not CO2) per year. A metric
ton, which is 1,000 kg, is usually written as tonne to distinguish it from the
2,000-lb American, or short, ton.
Solution We first need to express that consumption rate in moles. Converting
kJ of energy into moles of methane is straightforward:
moles CH4 =

10.9 * 1016 kJ/yr
39 * 103 kJ/m3

*

1
= 12.5 * 1013 mol/yr
22.4 * 10 - 3 m3/mol

51

Environmental Chemistry

We know from the balanced chemical reaction given in (1) that each mole of CH4
yields 1 mole of CO2, so there will be 12.5 * 1013 moles of CO2 emitted. Since
the molecular weight of CO2 is 44, the mass of CO2 emitted is
mass CO2 = 12.5 * 1013 mol/yr * 44 g/mol = 5.5 * 1015 g/yr
To express these emissions as tonnes of C per year, we must convert grams to
tonnes and then sort out the fraction of CO2 that is carbon. The fraction of CO2
that is C is simply the ratio of the atomic weight of carbon (12) to the molecular
weight of carbon dioxide (44):
C emissions = 5.5 * 1015 g CO2/yr *

1 kg
1,000 g

*

12 g C
1 tonne
*
1,000 kg
44 g CO2

= 1.5 * 109 tonnes/yr = 1.5 gigatonne/yr = 1.5 GtC/yr

The 1.5 * 109 tonnes of carbon found in the preceding example is about
20 percent of the total, worldwide carbon emissions entering the atmosphere each
year when fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) are burned. “Global Atmospheric
Change” the main worry about these emissions is their potential to enhance the
Earth’s greenhouse effect.

Enthalpy in Chemical Systems
Just as we used conservation of mass to balance chemical equations, we can use the
conservation of energy to learn something about heat absorbed or released during
chemical reactions. Since energy must be conserved, we should be able to track it
from beginning to end. The first law of thermodynamics lets us say that the energy
in the reactants on the left side of the equation, plus any heat added to the system,
should equal the energy contained in the reaction products on the right side, plus
any work done during the reaction.
U1 + Q = U2 + W

Although many forms of work could be included in (4), our concern will be
only with work that occurs when a system changes volume under constant pressure,
which is typical of chemical reactions. Any possibility of electrical, magnetic, gravitational, or other forms of work will be ignored. To analyze this work done by
expansion, consider the cylinder in Figure 1 containing a volume of gas V exerting a
pressure P against a piston with area A. The force exerted by the gas on the piston is

FIGURE 1 Work done when a substance expands at constant pressure is P¢V.

P * A. If the piston moves a distance d, then, since work is force * distance, we
can write
W = F d = P A d = P(V2 - V1)

(5)

Substituting (5) into (4) and rearranging terms gives
(U2 + PV2) - (U1 + PV1) = Q

(6)

If we define the enthalpy, H, of a system as
H = U + PV

(7)

H2 - H1 = ¢H = Q

(8)

then
That is, the change in enthalpy during a constant pressure reaction is equal to the
heat absorbed by the system. When ¢H is positive, heat is absorbed and the reaction
is said to be endothermic. When ¢H is negative, heat is liberated and the reaction is
called exothermic. The change in enthalpy, H2 - H1, is called the heat of reaction.
As is usually the case for discussions about energy, it is changes in energy, or in
this case enthalpy, that are of interest. For example, we can talk about the potential
energy of an object as being its weight times its height above some reference elevation. Our choice of reference elevation doesn’t matter as long as we are only interested in the change in potential energy as an object is raised against gravity from one
height to another. Similarly, since changes in enthalpy during a chemical reaction are
of interest, it doesn’t really matter what reference conditions are chosen. Tabulated
values of enthalpy are usually based on 1 atm of pressure and 25°C (298 K); in
which case, they are designated with the notation
H0298 = standard enthalpy = enthalpy at 1 atm and 298 K (kJ/mol)

(9)

It is also assumed that the reference condition for pure elements is the stable
state of the substance at 1 atm and 25°C. For example, the stable state of oxygen at
1 atm and 25°C, is gaseous O2, so the standard enthalpy for O2 (g), where (g) just
means it is in the gaseous state, is defined to be 0. Similarly, mercury under those
conditions is a liquid, so the standard enthalpy for Hg (l) is 0, where (l) means the
liquid state. A table of standard enthalpies for a number of substances is presented
in Table 1. More extensive lists can be found in chemical handbooks or more
advanced environmental engineering texts.
The sum of the enthalpies of the reaction products minus the sum of the
enthalpies of the reactants is called the heat of reaction. When it is negative, heat is

liberated during the reaction; when it is positive, heat is absorbed. Since standard
enthalpies are expressed as energy per mole, we must first balance the chemical
reaction, and then for each species, multiply the number of moles by the standard
enthalpy to get its total enthalpy.
EXAMPLE 4 Gross Heat of Combustion for Methane
Find the heat of reaction when methane CH4 is oxidized to CO2 and liquid H2O.
Solution The reaction is written here, and enthalpies taken from Table 1
appear below it.
CH4 (g)

+

2 O2 (g)
2 * (0)

:

CO2 (g)
(-393.5)

+

2 H2O (l)
2 * (-285.8)

Notice we have used the enthalpy of liquid water for this calculation. The heat of
reaction is the difference between the total enthalpy of the reaction products and
reactants:
[(-393.5) + 2 * (-285.8)] - [(-74.9) + 2 * (0)] = -890.2 kJ/mol of CH4
Since the heat of reaction is negative, heat is released during combustion (i.e., it is
exothermic).
When a fuel is burned, some of the energy released ends up as latent heat in the
water vapor produced. Usually that water vapor, along with the latent heat it contains, exits the stack along with all the other combustion gases, and its heating value
is, in essence, lost. That leads to two different values of what is called the heat of
combustion. The higher heating value (HHV) includes the heat released when water

54

Environmental Chemistry

condenses to liquid form, as was the case in Example 4. The HHV is also known as
the gross heat of combustion. In the United States, the heat content of fossil fuels is
usually expressed as this gross amount. The lower heating value (LHV), or net heat
of combustion, is based on the heat of reaction when water is assumed to remain in
the vapor state. The most fuel-efficient, modern furnaces used for space-heating
buildings achieve their high efficiencies (above 90 percent) by causing the combustion gases to cool enough to condense the water vapor before it leaves the stack. Not
unexpectedly, these are called condensing furnaces.

EXAMPLE 5 The Net Heat of Combustion
Find the net heat of combustion when methane is burned.
Solution We just repeat the procedure of Example 4, but this time, the water
will remain in the gaseous state. Again, using values from Table 1,
CH4 (g)

2 O2 (g)
2 * (0)

:

CO2 (g)
( - 393.5)

+

2 H2O (g)
2 * (- 241.8)

The net heat of combustion is
[(-393.5) + 2 * (-241.8)] - [(-74.9) + 2 * (0)] = - 802.2 kJ/mol of CH4
Again, the sign tells us this is an exothermic reaction. Notice about 10 percent of
the gross heating value is lost when water vapor is not condensed.

There is another application of the concept of enthalpy that is useful in
describing photochemical smog reactions in the atmosphere and for analyzing the
chemical reactions that affect the stratospheric ozone layer. When a molecule is
dissociated by absorbing a photon of energy, the process is called a photochemical
reaction, photochemical dissociation, or more simply photolysis. We can use enthalpies to determine the amount of energy a photon must have to cause photolysis,
and from the photon’s energy, we can determine the maximum wavelength that the
photon can have.
For a photon to be able to cause photolysis, it must have at least as much
energy as the change in enthalpy for the reaction. It is important to realize that when
a molecule absorbs a photon, the energy must be used almost immediately for photolysis or else the energy will be dissipated as waste heat as the molecule collides with
neighboring molecules. Molecules cannot store up energy from a series of photon
encounters, waiting until enough energy is accumulated to cause photolysis. That
means a single photon has to have sufficient energy to cause photolysis all by itself.
The following relationship between energy contained in 1 photon and the
wavelength and frequency associated with that photon is introduced:
E = hn =

We are interested in the maximum wavelength that a photon can have and still have
enough energy for photolysis, so rearranging (10) gives
l …

(11)

Before we can equate the energy in a photon with the enthalpy change, we have to
be sure the units are consistent. The reaction’s enthalpy change ¢H0 has units of
kJ/mol, and E is joules per photon. Using Avogadro’s number, along with the fact
that 1 photon dissociates 1 molecule, lets us write:
l …

6.6 * 10 - 34 J # s * 3 * 108 m/s * 6.02 * 1023 molecules/mol * 1 photon/molecule

What maximum wavelength of light would be capable of causing photolysis of
ozone O3 into O2 and O?
Solution First write the reaction, including enthalpies from Table 1. Even
though those enthalpies are for standard conditions (1 atm, 298 K), they can be
used under stratospheric pressure and temperature conditions with only modest

absorb energy for it to take place. That energy comes from the photon.
From Equation (12),

Chemical Equilibria
In the reactions considered so far, the assumption has been that they proceed in one
direction only. Most chemical reactions are, to some extent, reversible, proceeding
in both directions at once. When the rates of reaction are the same—that is products
are being formed on the right at the same rate as they are being formed on the left—
the reaction is said to have reached equilibrium.
In this generalized reversible reaction
aA + bB ¡
— cC + dD

(13)

the small letters a, b, c, and d are coefficients corresponding to the number of molecules or ions of the respective substances that result in a balanced equation. The
capital letters A, B, C, and D are the chemical species. The double arrow designation
indicates that the reaction proceeds in both directions at the same time.
At equilibrium, we can write that
[C]c[D]d
[A]d[B]b

= K

(14)

where the [ ] designation represents concentrations of the substances at equilibrium,
expressed in moles per liter (molarity). Do not use concentrations in mg/L! K is
called the equilibrium constant. Informally, the equilibrium constant is spoken of as
the products over reactants or the ratio of products to reactants. It should also be
emphasized that (14) is valid only when chemical equilibrium is established, if ever.
Natural systems are often subject to constantly changing inputs, and since some reactions occur very slowly, equilibrium may never be established. A practicing environmental engineer must therefore use this important equation with a certain degree
of caution.
Equilibrium constants are used in so many ways in water chemistry that they
often are given specific names to describe a particular equilibrium process. Many
molecules, when dissolved in water, separate into positively charged ions, called
cations, and negatively charged ions, called anions. Equation (14) can be applied to
the dissociation of such molecules, in which case K is referred to as a dissociation
constant or an ionization constant. The quantity on the left in (13) may be a solid,
and the problem is to determine the degree to which that solid enters solution. In
such cases, the equilibrium constant is called the solubility product and is often
denoted KSP. In another process of environmental interest where a gas dissolves
in water, the equilibrium constant describing the concentration of gas in the water in
equilibrium with the concentration of the gas in the air is termed Henry’s constant
and denoted KH. These and other equilibrium constants will be discussed in the next
few sections. To lessen confusion, the kinetic rate constants are typically signified
using a lowercase k, whereas equilibrium constants are written with an uppercase K.
Finally, often when dealing with very large and very small numbers, it is helpful to introduce the following logarithmic measure:
X = 10 - pX

(15)

pX = -log X

(16)

or
where X is any number or a variable denoting any number.

Environmental Chemistry

Acid-Base Reactions
Water dissociates slightly into hydrogen ions (H + ) and hydroxide ions (OH-) as the
following reaction suggests
H2O ¡
— H + + OH-

(17)

The hydrogen ions, H , are also known as protons because when a hydrogen atom
loses an electron—is ionized—all that remains is a proton. The corresponding
equilibrium expression for this reaction is
+

[H + ][OH - ]
= K
[H2O]

(18)

The molar concentration of water [H2O] is 1,000 g/L divided by 18 g/mol, or
55.56 mol/L. Since water dissociates only slightly, the molar concentration after
ionization is not changed enough to be of significance, so [H2O] is essentially a
constant that can be included in the equilibrium constant. The result is
[H + ][OH - ] = Kw = 1 * 10-14

at 25°C

(19)

where Kw is the dissociation constant for water. For dilute aqueous solutions in general, [H2O] is considered constant and is included in the equilibrium constant. Kw is
slightly temperature dependent, but unless otherwise stated, the value given in (19)
at 25°C is the assumed value.
Note that (19) holds, no matter what the source of hydrogen ions or hydroxide
ions. That is, the equation is valid even if other substances dissolved in the water
make their own contributions to the hydrogen and hydroxide supplies. It is always
one of the equations that must be satisfied when chemical equilibria problems in
water are analyzed.
[H + ] and [OH-] concentrations are customarily expressed using the logarithmic measure introduced in (15) and (16). To express hydrogen ion concentrations
(also known as proton concentrations), the pH scale is used, where
pH = -log [H + ]

(20)

[H + ] = 10-pH

(21)

or,
With the pH scale, it is easy to specify whether a solution is acidic, basic, or
neutral. In a neutral solution, the concentration of hydrogen ions [H + ] equals the
concentration of hydroxide ions [OH-]. From (19), for a neutral solution
[H + ][OH-] = [H + ][H + ] = [H + ]2 = 10-14
so
[H + ] = 10-7
and a neutral solution has a pH of 7 (written pH 7).
An acidic solution is one in which [H + ] is greater than [OH-]; that is, the
hydrogen ion concentration is greater than 10-7 mol/L, and its pH is less than 7. A
basic solution is the other way around with more hydroxide ions than hydrogen
ions and a pH greater than 7. Notice for every unit change in pH, the concentration
of hydrogen ions changes by a factor of 10.

common solutions. Notice in the figure that a distinction is made between distilled
water and “pure” rainfall. As will be seen in a later section on carbonates, as rainwater falls, it absorbs carbon dioxide from the air and carbonic acid is formed.
Unpolluted rainfall then has a natural pH of around 5.6. By the usual definition,
acid rain, caused by industrial pollutants, has pH lower than 5.6. Actual acid rain
and acid fog have been recorded with pH below 2.0.
EXAMPLE 7 pH of Tomato Juice
Find the hydrogen ion concentration and the hydroxide ion concentration in
tomato juice having a pH of 4.1.
Solution

From (21), the hydrogen ion concentration is

Water is not the only source of hydrogen ions or hydroxide ions. When a chemical
dissociates in water and produces a hydrogen ion, it is an acid. As you would expect,
any chemical that dissociates and gives off a hydroxide ion is a base. In other words,
acids add protons (or subtract hydroxide ions) in water, whereas bases add hydroxide ions (or subtract protons). For instance, when acetic acid (C2H4O2), the main
component in vinegar, is dissolved in water, some of it dissociates to protons (H + )
and acetate (C2H3O2-). At equilibrium,
CH3COOH + H2O ¡
— CH3COO- + H + + H2O
The chemical composition of acetic acid is usually written as CH3COOH rather
than C2H4O2 to emphasize the presence of the carboxylic acid group (¬ COOH),
an organic functional group that will be explained later in this chapter. Since H2O

59

Environmental Chemistry

appears as both a reactant and product, it is usually dropped from the equation, so
the equilibrium expression is written as
CH3COOH ¡
— CH3COO- + H +

(22)

and the dissociation constant (with a subscript “a” for acidity constant) is
Ka =

[CH3COO-][H + ]
= 10-4.76
[CH3COOH]

(23)

The degree of dissociation of an acid is a function of pH. This can be seen by
rearranging (23) and using (21) to get
Ka
Ka
[CH3COO-]
=

-pH
[H ]
[CH3COOH]
10

(24)

As pH goes up, that is, the H + concentration goes down, then the ratio of concentration of acetate to acetic acid goes up. This is true for all acids; as the pH increases the
degree of dissociation increases. In addition, when [H + ] = Ka (pH = pKa), then by
(24), [CH3COOH] = [CH3COO-]. Figure 3 shows this graphically in what is called
an a (alpha) diagram. In an a diagram, a0 denotes the fraction of total acid-derived
species present (for this example, [CH3COOH] + [CH3COO-]) in the undissociated
form (in this example, CH3COOH), whereas a1 is the fraction that is in the dissociated or singly deprotonated form (in this example, CH3COO-). Remember if we had
added acetate rather than acetic acid to the water, the acetate would have been a base
because some of it would have withdrawn hydrogen ions from the water to form
acetic acid to satisfy the (24) equilibrium between CH3COO- and CH3COOH. In
fact, we call acetate the conjugate base of acetic acid.
Acetic acid is an example of a monoprotic acid, meaning it can lose 1 proton
(H + ) when dissolved in water. There are also diprotic, triprotic, and even quadriprotic acids. Table 2 shows some of the acids of environmental importance. As you
would expect, the number of dissociation constants corresponds to the number of
hydrogen ions an acid can lose, so the dissociation constant for dissociating the first
proton is Ka1, for the second proton is Ka2, and so on. The behavior of a very important diprotic acid system, the carbonate system, will be discussed later in this chapter.
Acid-base reactions are among the most important in environmental engineering. Most aquatic forms of life, for example, are very sensitive to the pH of their

habitat. To protect local ecosystems, waste neutralization before release is common.
In other circumstances, by manipulating pH, unwanted substances can be driven out
of a solution as precipitates or gases before the effluent is released.
EXAMPLE 8 Drinking Water Disinfection Using Chlorine
Chlorine is the active ingredient in most household bleach and is one of the most
commonly used and inexpensive chemical disinfectants for water. The chlorine is
in the hypochlorous acid form, HOCl, and hypochlorous acid is a much better
disinfectant than hypochlorite, OCl- , its conjugate base. If bleach is used to disinfect water, below what pH should the water be maintained so that at least
95 percent of the chlorine added is in the hypochlorous acid form?
Solution From Table 2 and inspection, we know hypochlorous acid is a monoprotic acid. Its equilibrium reaction is
HOCl ¡
(25)
— OCl- + H +
The equilibrium constant equation is
Ka1 =

[OCl-][H + ]
= 10-7.60
[HOCl]

(26)

which rearranges to
[H + ] =

[HOCl]Ka1
[OCl-]

We can then solve for [H + ] when [HOCl]>[OCl] = 95>5 = 19, so
[H + ] = 19 * 10-7.60 = 4.77 * 10-7 = 10-6.32
If the pH is kept below 6.3, then more than 95 percent of the chlorine will be in
the HOCL form.

Solubility Product
All solids are to some degree soluble, although some are much more so than others.
A generalized equation describing the equilibrium condition in which a solid is dissociating into its ionic components (dissolution) at the same rate that ionic components are recombining into the solid form (precipitation) is
Solid ¡
— aA + bB

(27)

where A and B are the ionic components that make up the solid. Applying (14)
yields
[A]a[B]b
= K
[solid]

(28)

As long as there is still solid present at equilibrium, its effect can be incorporated into the equilibrium constant
[A]a[B]b = Ksp

(29)

where Ksp is called the solubility product. Table 3 gives a short list of solubility
products of particular importance in environmental engineering.
As an example of the use of (29), consider the fluoridation of water with
calcium fluoride, CaF2.
EXAMPLE 9 Fluoride Solubility
Find the equilibrium concentration of fluoride ions in pure water caused by the
dissociation of CaF2. Express the answer both in units of mol/L and mg/L.
Solution

From Table 3, the reaction and solubility product are
CaF2 ¡
— Ca2 + + 2F -

Ksp = 3 * 10 - 11

Remembering to square the term for the fluoride ion, the mass action equation
(29) becomes
[Ca2 + ][F - ]2 = 3 * 10 - 11

62

(30)

Environmental Chemistry

If we let s (mol/L) represent the concentration of Ca2 + , then the concentration of
F - will be 2s, since 2 moles of F - are dissociated for every mole of Ca2 + dissociated. Thus
[Ca2 + ] = s
[F - ] = 2s
and from (30)
Ksp = s * (2s)2 = 4s3 = 3 * 10 - 11
s = [Ca2 + ] = 2 * 10 - 4 mol/L
2s = [F - ] = 4 * 10 - 4 mol/L
To find the concentration of fluoride ions in mg/L, we need the atomic weight of
fluorine, which is 19.
[F - ] = 4 * 10 - 4 mol/L * 19 g/mol * 103 mg/g = 7.6 mg/L

The fluoride concentration obtained in Example 9 is above recommended
drinking water levels of 1.8 mg/L. Fluoride concentrations of approximately 1 mg/L
in drinking water help prevent cavities in children, but discoloration of teeth, called
mottling, is relatively common when concentrations exceed 2.0 mg/L.

Solubility of Gases in Water
When air comes in contact with water, some of it dissolves into the water. Different
constituents of air dissolve to different degrees and in amounts that vary with temperature and water purity. The behavior of gases in contact with water was reported by W. Henry in England in 1903, and the resulting relationship is known as
Henry’s law:
[gas] = KHPg

(31)

where
[gas] = concentration of dissolved gas (mol/L)
KH = Henry’s law constant (mol/L # atm)
Pg = the partial pressure of the gas in air (atm)
The quantity Pg is the partial pressure of the gas in air, which is simply its
volumetric concentration times the atmospheric pressure. The units suggested in
the preceding list for pressure are atmospheres (atm), where 1 atm corresponds
to 101,325 pascals (Pa), and 1 Pa equals 1 newton per square meter. For example,
oxygen makes up about 21 percent of the atmosphere, so at 1 atm Pg would be
0.21 * 1 atm = 0.21 atm.
Each gas-liquid system has its own value for Henry’s coefficient. The coefficient varies both with temperature (solubility decreases as temperature increases)
and with concentration of other dissolved gases and solids (the solubility decreases
as other dissolved material in the liquid increases). Note that Henry’s law is
expressed in various ways with different units for the coefficient depending on the

method of expression. The user must be careful, then, to check the units given for
Henry’s constant before applying the law. Table 4 gives some values of KH for CO2
and O2, two of the gases that we will be most concerned with.
Because atmospheric pressure changes with altitude, Pg will change as well.
One estimate for atmospheric pressure as a function of altitude is the following
(Thomann and Mueller, 1987):
P = Po - 1.15 * 10-4H

(32)

where
P = atmospheric pressure at altitude H (atm)
H = altitude (m)
Po = atmospheric pressure at sea level (atm)

EXAMPLE 10 Solubility of Oxygen in Water
By volume, the concentration of oxygen in air is about 21 percent. Find the equilibrium concentration of O2 in water (in mol/L and mg/L) at 25°C and 1 atmosphere of pressure. Recalculate it for Denver at an altitude of 1,525 m.
Solution

Air is 21 percent oxygen, so its partial pressure at 1 atm is
Pg = 0.21 * 1 atm = 0.21 atm

From Table 4, at 25°C, KH = 0.0012630 mol/L # atm; so, from (31),
[O2] = KH Pg = 0.0012630 mol/L # atm * 0.21 atm
= 2.65 * 10 - 4 mol/L
= 2.65 * 10 - 4 mol/L * 32 g/mol * 103 mg/g = 8.5 mg/L
In Denver, at 1,525 m, atmospheric pressure can be estimated using (32):
P = Po - 1.15 * 10 - 4H = 1 - 1.15 * 10 - 4 * 1,525 = 0.825 atm
so
[O2] = 0.0012630 mol/L # atm * 0.21 * 0.825 atm = 2.19 * 10 - 4 mol/L
= 2.19 * 10 - 4 mol/L * 32 g/mol * 103 mg/g = 7.0 mg/L

Environmental Chemistry

Calculations based on Henry’s law provide equilibrium concentrations of dissolved gases, or, as they are frequently called, saturation values. Often, actual values
differ considerably from those at equilibrium. There may be more than the saturation value of a dissolved gas, as when photosynthesis by plants pumps oxygen into
the water at a faster rate than it can leave through the air/water interface. It is more
common for dissolved gases to be less than the saturation value, as occurs when bacteria decompose large quantities of waste, drawing oxygen from the water (possibly
leading to an oxygen deficiency that can kill fish). In either case, when an excess
or a deficiency of a dissolved gas occurs, pressures act to try to bring the amount
dissolved back to the saturation level.
As an example of the value of being able to engineer pH and utilize gas transfer across the air/water interface, consider the problem of removing nitrogen from
wastewater. Nitrogen is a nutrient that can degrade water quality by stimulating excessive algal growth in receiving bodies of water. Nitrogen in the form of nitrate
NO3- also poses another problem, especially in groundwater. When babies drink
water with high nitrate content, a potentially lethal condition known as methemoglobinemia can result.
One way to remove nitrogen during wastewater treatment is with a process
known as ammonia stripping. When organic matter decomposes, nitrogen is first
released in the form of ammonia NH3 or ammonium ion NH4+ . Ammonium ions
are acids, whereas NH3 is ammonia gas, which dissolves in water with a Henry’s
constant of 57 mol/L # atm at 25°C. Even though ammonia is much more soluble in
water than, for instance, the oxygen in the preceding example, the concentration of
ammonia in the air is near zero so ammonia is readily driven from water (stripped)
and transferred to the air as the system tries to reach the air/water equilibrium state.
By driving the acid/base equilibrium reaction
NH4+ ¡
(33)
— NH + H +

toward the right, more of the nitrogen will be in the ammonia gas form, which can
then be stripped from solution and enter the air in a gas stripping tower. In such a
tower, contaminated water is allowed to trickle downward over slats or corrugated
surfaces while clean air is blown in from the bottom to aerate the dripping water.
Gas stripping can be used in wastewater treatment facilities to remove such gases as
ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, and it can also be used to remove volatile organic
chemicals (VOCs) from contaminated groundwater.
To strip ammonia, the reaction given in (33) must be driven toward the right,
which can be done by increasing the concentration of OH - . This may be more easily seen by adding a hydroxide ion (OH - ) to both sides of (33), which gives
¡ NH + H O
NH4+ + OH - —
3
2

(34)

Thus, by adding OH - , in other words raising the pH, (34) is driven to the right so
that more of the nitrogen is in the ammonia and strippable form.
EXAMPLE 11 Ammonia Stripping
Nitrogen in a wastewater treatment plant is in the form of ammonia and ammonium ion and has a total concentration of 7.1 * 10-4 M. The Henry’s constant
(at 25°C) is 57 mol/L # atm.

65

Environmental Chemistry

a. Find the fraction of the nitrogen that is in the ammonia form (and hence
strippable) as a function of pH, and draw a graph.
b. If the wastewater pH is raised to 10 and the atmospheric ammonia concentration is 5.0 * 10-10 atm, what would be the equilibrium concentration of
total nitrogen in the wastewater after air stripping?
Solution

From (33) and Table 2, the equilibrium equation for the reaction is
Ka =

As Example 11 suggests, to drive the reaction significantly toward the ammonia side requires a pH in excess of about 10. Because typical wastewaters seldom
have a pH that high, it is necessary to add chemicals, usually lime (CaO), to sufficiently raise the pH. The lime, unfortunately, reacts with CO2 in the air to form a
calcium carbonate scale that can accumulate on stripping surfaces and which must
be removed periodically, creating a sludge disposal problem of its own.
The preceding example is just one illustration of the value of being able to control pH in treatment processes. In other circumstances, pollution affects pH, driving
reactions in directions that may be undesirable. A notable example of this phenomenon is the mobilization of trace metals, especially aluminum, when pH drops during
acidification of a watershed. Aluminum is very toxic to fish, but its normal form is an
insoluble solid and relatively safe. However, when acid deposition acidifies a lake, the
reduced pH drives equilibria reactions toward liberation of mobile Al3 + ions, which
are very toxic.

The Carbonate System
The carbonate system is the most important acid-base system in natural waters
because it largely controls pH. It is comprised of the following chemical species:
Aqueous carbon dioxide
Carbonic acid
Bicarbonate ion
Carbonate ion

CO2 (aq)
H2CO3
HCO3CO23 -

Aqueous CO2 is formed when atmospheric CO2 dissolves in water; we can
find its concentration in fresh water using Henry’s law (31):
[CO2]aq = KHPg

(39)

67

Environmental Chemistry

The concentration is in (mol/L) and PCO2 is the partial pressure of gaseous CO2
in the atmosphere (about 360 ppmv or 360 * 10-6 atm). Aqueous CO2 then forms
carbonic acid (H2CO3). Carbonic acid is a diprotic acid, which can lose two protons
(hydrogen ions, H + ). The first proton is released when it ionizes to form bicarbonate (HCO3- ):
CO2(aq) + H2O ¡
(40)
— H CO ¡
— H + + HCO 2

3

3

The bicarbonate (HCO3- ) further dissociates to release another hydrogen ion and
carbonate (CO23 - ):
HCO3- ¡
(41)
— H + + CO23 In addition, if there is a source of solid calcium carbonate (CaCO3), such as occurs
when water is in contact with limestone rocks, then the solubility reaction for
CaCO3(s) applies in the system. Such waters are referred to as calcareous waters.
¡ Ca2 + + CO2 CaCO3(s) —
(42)
3

If sufficient time is allowed for the system to reach equilibrium, then the equilibrium constants given in Table 2 for reactions (40–41) and in Table 3 for reaction
(42) can be used to analyze the system. Reaction (40) results in
[H + ][HCO3- ]
= K1 = 4.47 * 10 - 7 mol/L
[CO2(aq)]

(43)

[H + ][CO23 - ]
= K2 = 4.68 * 10 - 11 mol/L
[HCO3- ]

(44)

and (41) yields

while (42) is governed by
[Ca2 + ][CO23 - ] = Ksp = 4.57 * 10 - 9 mol2/L2

(45)

The values of K1, K2, and Ksp are temperature dependent. The values given in
(43–45) are at 25°C.
Four possible conditions determine the behavior of the carbonate system.
There may or may not be a source of solid carbonate as indicated in (42), and the
solution may or may not be exposed to the atmosphere. If it is exposed to the
atmosphere, the system is said to be open; if it is not, the system is closed. We will
analyze the common situation of an open system not in contact with a carbonate
solid, such as occurs when rainwater passes through the atmosphere absorbing CO2
and forming carbonic acid.
Before proceeding to that calculation, it is useful to compare the relative concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate as a function of pH. Dividing (44) by
[H + 4 gives
[CO23 - ]
K2

(46)

and then incorporating the value of K2 given in (44) yields:

[HCO3 ]

In (47), unless pH is extremely high, the carbonate concentration is usually
negligible compared to the bicarbonate concentration, a fact that is useful in the

following example where we calculate the pH of pristine rainwater. The pH dependency of the relative fractions of carbonate, bicarbonate, and carbonate acid is easily
seen in the a diagram (Figure 5) for the carbonate system.
EXAMPLE 12 The pH of Natural Rainwater
Estimate the pH of natural rainwater, assuming that the only substance affecting it
is the absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere. Assume that the concentration of
CO2 is 390 ppmv, and the temperature and pressure are 25°C and 1 atmosphere.
Solution We have a number of equations to work with that are based on equilibrium constants, but another relationship needs to be introduced based on
charge neutrality. The rainwater is assumed to have started without any electrical
charge, and no net charge is added to it by the absorption of carbon dioxide. To
maintain this neutrality, the total positive charge contributed by the hydrogen
ions (H + ) must equal the total negative charge of the bicarbonate (HCO3- ),
carbonate (CO23 - ), and hydroxyl (OH - ) ions:
[H + ] = [HCO3- ] + 2[CO23 - ] + [OH - ]

(48)

(CO23 - )

Notice that since each carbonate ion
has two negative charges, its charge
contribution is twice as much per mole; hence, its coefficient is 2.
Knowing that rainfall is likely to be slightly acidic will let us simplify (48).
Equation (41) indicates that for an acidic solution, [CO23 - ] V [HCO3- ], so (48)
becomes
[H + ] = [HCO3- ] + [OH - ]
(49)

69

Environmental Chemistry

Another equation that must be satisfied is (19):
[H + ][OH - ] = Kw = 10 - 14

(19)

Substituting (19) into (49) gives
[H + ] = [HCO3- ] +

10 - 14
[H + ]

(50)

Placing [HCO3- ] from (43) into (50) yields
[H + ] =

K1[CO2(aq)] + 10 - 14
[H + ]

(51)

So,
[H + ]2 = K1[CO2(aq)] + 10 - 14

(52)

We can find the saturation value of dissolved CO2 from (39):
3CO24 = KHPg

= 0.033363 mol/L # atm * 390 * 10 - 6 atm = 1.3 * 10 - 5 mol/L

(39)

where KH was taken from Table 4, and PCO2 is given as 390 ppm or
390 * 10-6 atm. Equation (52) now gives
[H + ]2 = (4.47 * 10 - 7 * 1.3 * 10 - 5 + 10 - 14)(mol/L)2
so
[H + ] = 2.42 * 10 - 6 mol/L
pH = -log [H + ] = 5.62

Example 12 indicates that the pH of pristine rainwater is not the same as the
pH of pure water due to the presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Other
naturally occurring substances in the atmosphere also affect pH. Sulfur dioxide
(SO2) lowers pH, and ammonia and alkaline dust raise it. When all such natural
substances are accounted for, rainfall is likely to have pH somewhere between 5 and
6 before it is influenced by human activities. As a result, some define acid rain
caused by human activities to be rainfall with a pH of 5 or below, whereas others
prefer to define it in terms of the preceding carbonate calculation, that is, as precipitation with pH less than 5.6.

Organic Chemistry
Organic chemistry has come to mean the chemistry of the compounds of carbon.
This term is broader than the term biochemistry, which can be described as the
chemistry of life. The need for a distinction between the two began with a discovery
by Fredrich Wöhler in 1828. He accidentally converted an inorganic compound,

70

Environmental Chemistry

ammonium cyanate, into urea, which until that time had been thought to be strictly
associated with living things. That discovery demolished the vital-force theory,
which held that organic and inorganic compounds were distinguished by some sort
of “life force.” With carbon at the heart of the definition of organic chemistry, even
DDT is just as organic as yogurt.
The science of organic chemistry is incredibly complex and varied. Literally
millions of different organic compounds are known today, and 100,000 or so of
these are products of synthetic chemistry, unknown in nature. About all that can be
done here in a few pages is to provide the barest introduction to the origins of some
of their names and structures, so that they will appear a bit less alien when you
encounter them in the rest of the book.
One way to visualize the bonding of atoms is with electron-dot formulas that
represent valence electrons in the outermost orbitals. These diagrams were developed by G. N. Lewis in 1916 and are referred to as Lewis structures. According to
Lewis’ theory of covalence, atoms form bonds by losing, gaining, or sharing enough
electrons to achieve the outer electronic configuration of a noble gas. For hydrogen,
that means bonding with two shared electrons; for many other elements, including
carbon, it means achieving a pattern with eight outermost electrons. For example,
the following Lewis structure for the compound butane (C4H10) clearly shows each
hydrogen atom sharing a pair of electrons and each carbon atom sharing four pairs
of electrons.

H H H H
H C C C C H

n-butane

H H H H
A common way to simplify Lewis structures is to use a single straight line to
represent pairs of shared electrons, as shown next. For convenience, the structural
formula is often written linearly by combining hydrogens bonded to a given carbon
and then showing those subunits connected by carbon-carbon bonds. Thus, for example, butane becomes CH3 ¬ CH2 ¬ CH2 ¬ CH3. Further simplification, referred
to as a condensed formula, can be gained by not actually showing the C ¬ C bonds
but merely grouping atoms connected to each carbon and writing the result. Butane
becomes CH3(CH2)2CH3.
Another way to simplify the structural formula for some organic chemicals is
with a symbolic “kinky” diagram. Each carbon in such a diagram is indicated with
a kink, and the hydrogens are not shown at all. The number of hydrogens is easy to
determine since the number of bonds to the carbon kink must be 4. A kinky diagram
for n-butane is shown here.

When butane has the structure shown, that is with all of its carbons lined up in
a straight chain (no side branches), it is called normal-butane, or n-butane. Butane
also occurs in another form known as isobutane. Isobutane (i-butane) has the same
molecular formula, C4H10, but has a different structural formula as shown here:

Compounds having the same molecular formula but different structural formulas
are known as structural isomers. Isomers may have very different chemical and
physical properties. As the number of carbon atoms per molecule increases, the
number of possible isomers increases dramatically. Decane (C10H22), for example,
has 75 possible isomers.
Butane and decane are examples of an important class of compounds called
hydrocarbons, compounds containing only H and C atoms. Hydrocarbons in which
each carbon atom forms four single bonds to other atoms are called saturated
hydrocarbons, paraffins, or alkanes. Alkanes form a series beginning with methane
(CH4), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), and butane (C4H10), which are all gases.
The series continues with pentane (C5H12) through (C20H42), which are liquids and
include gasoline and diesel fuel. Beyond that, the alkanes are waxy solids. Notice
that the name for each of these compounds ends in -ane. When one of the hydrogens
is removed from an alkane, the result is called a radical, and the suffix becomes -yl.
Thus, for example, removing one hydrogen from methane (CH4) produces the
methyl radical (CH3 ¬ ). Table 5 lists some of the methane-series radicals.
Hydrocarbons appear as building blocks in a great number of chemicals of
environmental importance. By substituting other atoms or groups of atoms for
some of the hydrogens, new compounds are formed. To get a feel for the naming
of these compounds, consider the replacement of some of the hydrogen atoms
with chlorine in an ethane molecule. Each carbon atom is given a number, and the
corresponding hydrogen replacements are identified by that number. For example,
1,1,1-trichloroethane, better known as TCA, has three chlorines all attached to the
same carbon, whereas 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2 DCA) has one chlorine attached to

Solution Propane has three carbons. The three chlorine atoms can be (1) all

two in the middle, or (5) one on each carbon atom. They would be numbered

All of the examples so far have been of saturated hydrocarbons. Unsaturated
compounds contain at least two carbon atoms joined by a double bond in which four
electrons are shared. When there are double bonds, the chemical name ends in -ene,
and this category of hydrocarbons is called alkenes. The ethylene series of alkenes is
analogous to the methane series of alkanes. It begins with ethene (ethylene), propene
(propylene), butene (butylene), and so forth.

Environmental Chemistry

A number of alkanes and alkenes of importance in environmental engineering
have some of their hydrogen atoms replaced with chlorine atoms. For example,
trichloroethylene, which is more commonly known as TCE, has been used as an
industrial solvent for organic substances that are not soluble in water. Principle
applications have included cleaning grease from metals, removing solder flux from
printed circuit boards in the electronics industry, dry-cleaning clothes, extracting
caffeine from coffee, and stripping paint. It was widely used until it was shown to
cause cancer in animals. It has the dubious distinction of being the most commonly
found contaminant in groundwater at Superfund hazardous waste sites.
Alkane and alkene hydrocarbons often have attachments of various functional
groups of atoms. The attachment of the hydroxyl group ¬ OH produces alcohols;
the H ¬ C “ O group produces aldehydes; an oxygen ¬ O ¬ between carbons
yields ethers; connecting an ¬ OH group to a C “ O group yields carboxylic acids;
and attachments of the ¬ NH2 group result in amines. Examples of these hydrocarbon derivatives are shown here:

Benzene

In the figure for benzene, each carbon atom has been shown forming a single
bond with one neighboring carbon and a double bond with the other. That representation is a gross simplification that should not be interpreted too literally; that is, the
diagram is really a kind of average value of an actual benzene molecule. As shown,
the benzene ring is usually simplified by leaving off the hydrogen atoms.
Molecules in which the hexagonal benzene ring occur are called aromatic compounds. This category includes DDT; polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); and the
defoliants used in the Vietnam War, 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. When a benzene ring attaches

to another molecule, the C6H5 ¬ that remains of the benzene ring is called a phenyl
group, so the name phenyl frequently appears in the compound name. Another
physical characteristic of these compounds that is described by the nomenclature is
the location of the attachments to the benzene ring. The terms ortho, meta, or para, or
a numerical designation, specify the relative locations of the attachments as suggested
in Figure 6.
Figure 7 shows examples of the o, m, p nomenclature for two isomers of
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Hopefully, this 31-letter name is somewhat
less intimidating than it was before you read this section. Reading the name from
right to left, the ethane on the end tells us it starts as a simple 2-carbon ethane molecule; the trichloro refers to the 3 chlorines around one of the carbons; the diphenyl
tells us there are 2 phenyl groups; and the dichloro refers to the chlorines on the
phenyls. p,p¿ -DDT is an isomer with the chlorine and carbon attachments to each
benzene located in the para position; the o,p¿ -DDT has 1 chlorine in the ortho position and 1 in the para position. Actually, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane as a name
is insufficient to unambiguously describe DDT. An even more informative name is
1,1,1-trichloro-2-2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethane, where -bis means “taken twice.”

(2,4,5-T) shown in Figure 8 provide examples of this numerical designation. Notice
the carboxylic acid functional group ¬ COOH connected to a ¬ CH2 ¬ looks like
acetic acid, which is contained in the names of these complex molecules.
Providing unambiguous names for complex organic molecules is extremely
difficult and what has been provided here is obviously just a very brief introduction.
Even the structural formulas, which convey much more information than a name
like DDT, are still highly simplified representations, and there are yet higher level
descriptions based on quantum mechanics.

Nuclear Chemistry
As a simple but adequate model, we may consider an atom to consist of a dense nucleus containing a number of uncharged neutrons and positively charged protons,
surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The number of protons is the
atomic number, which defines a particular element. The sum of the number of protons and neutrons is the mass number. Elements with the same atomic number but
differing mass numbers are called isotopes. The usual way to identify a given isotope
is by giving its chemical symbol with the mass number written at the upper left and
the atomic number at the lower left. For example, the two most important isotopes
of uranium (which has 92 protons) are
235
92U

Uranium-235

and

238
92U

Uranium-238

When referring to a particular element, it is common to drop the atomic number
subscript since it adds little information to the chemical symbol. Thus, U-238 is a
common way to describe that isotope. When describing changes to an element as it
decays, the full notation is usually helpful.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable, that is, radioactive, and during the spontaneous changes that take place within the nucleus, various forms of radiation are
emitted. Although all elements having more than 83 protons are naturally radioactive, it is possible to artificially produce unstable isotopes, or radionuclides, of

76

Environmental Chemistry

virtually every element in the periodic table. Radioactivity is of interest in the study
of environmental engineering both because it poses a hazard to exposed organisms,
and because it allows radionuclides to act as tracers to help measure the flow of
materials in the environment.
The three kinds of radiation are alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Alpha
radiation consists of a heavy 2-proton, 2-neutron particle emitted from the nucleus.
When an unstable nucleus emits an alpha particle, its atomic number decreases by
2 units, and its mass number decreases by 4 units. The following example shows the
decay of plutonium into uranium:
239
94Pu

:

235
92U

+ 42a + g

In this reaction, not only is an alpha (a) particle ejected from the nucleus, but
electromagnetic radiation is emitted as well, indicated by the g.
As an alpha particle passes through an object, its energy is gradually dissipated as it interacts with other atoms. Its positive charge attracts electrons in its path,
raising their energy levels and possibly removing them completely from their nuclei
(ionization). Alpha particles are relatively massive and easy to stop. Our skin is sufficient protection for sources, which are external to the body, but taken internally,
such as by inhalation, a particles can be extremely dangerous.
Beta (b) particles are electrons that are emitted from an unstable nucleus as a
result of the spontaneous transformation of a neutron into a proton plus an electron. Emission of a b particle results in an increase in the atomic number by one,
while the mass number remains unchanged. A gamma ray may or may not accompany the transformation. The following example shows the decay of strontium-90
into yttrium:
90
38Sr

:

90
39Y

+ b

As negatively charged b particles pass through materials, they encounter
swarms of electrons around individual atoms. The resulting Coulomb repulsive
force between orbital electrons and b particles can raise the energy level of those
electrons, possibly kicking them free of their corresponding atoms. Although such
ionizations occur less frequently than with a particles, b penetration is much deeper.
Alpha particles travel less than 100 mm into tissue, whereas b radiation may travel
several centimeters. They can be stopped with a modest amount of shielding, however. For example, to stop a b particle, a 1-cm thickness of aluminum is sufficient.
Gamma (g) rays have no charge or mass, being simply a form of electromagnetic radiation that travels at the speed of light. As such, they can be thought of
either as waves with characteristic wavelengths, or as photon particles. Gamma rays
have very short wavelengths in the range of 10-3 to 10-7 mm. Having such short
wavelengths means individual photons are highly energetic, and they easily cause
biologically damaging ionizations. These rays are very difficult to contain and may
require several centimeters of lead to provide adequate shielding.
All of these forms of radiation are dangerous to living things. The electron
excitations and ionizations that are caused by such radiation cause molecules to become unstable, resulting in the breakage of chemical bonds and other molecular
damage. The chain of chemical reactions that follows will result in the formation of
new molecules that did not exist before the irradiation. Then, on a much slower
time scale, the organism responds to the damage; so slow, in fact, that it may be

years before the final effects become visible. Low-level exposures can cause somatic
and/or genetic damage. Somatic effects may be observed in the organism that has
been exposed and include higher risk of cancer, leukemia, sterility, cataracts, and a
reduction in lifespan. Genetic damage, by increasing the mutation rate in chromosomes and genes, affects future generations.
One naturally occurring source of radiation exposure that is thought to be an
important cause of lung cancer results from the inhalation of radon (Rn-222) and
radon decay products (various isotopes of polonium). Radon is an a emitting,
chemically-inert gas that seeps out of the soil, which can sometimes accumulate in
houses. It is an intermediate product in a naturally occurring decay chain that
starts with uranium-238 and ends with a stable isotope of lead. Figure 9 diagrams
this radioactive series. Three other similar series can be drawn. One begins with
uranium-235 and ends with lead-207, another begins with thorium-232 and ends
with lead-208, and the third begins with the artificial isotope, plutonium-241, and
ends with bismuth-209.
An important parameter that characterizes a given radioactive isotope is its
half-life, which is the time required for half of the atoms to spontaneously transform, or decay, into other elements. For example, if we start with 100 g of an isotope that has a half-life of 1 year, we would find 50 g remaining after 1 year, 25 g
after 2 years, 12.5 g after 3 years, and so on. Although the half-life for a given isotope is constant, half-lives of radionuclides in general vary from fractions of a second to billions of years. Half-lives for the radon portion of the U-238 decay chain
are given in Table 6.
There are a number of commonly used radiation units, which unfortunately
can be easily confused. The curie (Ci) is the basic unit of decay rate; 1 Ci corresponds
to the disintegration of 3.7 * 1010 atoms per second, which is approximately
the decay rate of 1 g of radium. A more intuitive unit is the becquerel (Bq), which

corresponds to 1 radioactive decay per second; hence, 1 Ci = 3.7 * 1010 Bq.
Although the curie is a measure of the rate at which radiation is emitted by a source,
it tells us nothing about the radiation dose, which is actually absorbed by an object.
The roentgen (R) is defined in terms of the number of ionizations produced in a
given amount of air by x or g rays. (X rays are electromagnetic radiation similar to
gamma rays, but are generated by electron transitions rather than nuclear transformations.) Of more interest is the amount of energy actually absorbed by tissue, be it
bone, fat, muscle, or whatever. The rad (radiation absorbed dose) corresponds to an
absorption of 100 ergs of energy per gram of any substance. The rad has the further
advantage that it may be used for any form of radiation, a, b , g, or x. For water and
soft tissue, the rad and roentgen are approximately equal.
Another unit, the rem (roentgen equivalent man) has been introduced to take
into account the different biological effects that various forms of radiation have on
humans. Thus, for example, if a 10-rad dose of b particles produces the same biological effect as a 1-rad dose of a particles, both doses would have the same value
when expressed in rems. This unit is rather loosely defined, making it difficult to
convert from rads to rems. However, in many situations involving x-rays, g-rays,
and b radiation, rads and rems are approximately the same. The rem or millirem are
units most often used when describing human radiation exposure.

Nuclear Fission
Nuclear reactors obtain their energy from the heat that is produced when uranium
atoms fission. In a fission reaction, uranium-235 captures a neutron and becomes
unstable uranium-236, which splits apart and discharges two fission fragments, two
or three neutrons, and g-rays (Figure 10). Most of the energy released is in the form
of kinetic energy in the fission fragments. That energy is used to heat water, producing steam that powers a turbine and generator.
The fission fragments produced are always radioactive, and concerns for their
proper disposal have created much of the controversy surrounding nuclear reactors.
Typical fission fragments include cesium-137, which concentrates in muscles and
has a half-life of 30 years; strontium-90, which concentrates in bone and has a halflife of 28 years; and iodine-131, which concentrates in the thyroid gland and has a

half-life of 8.1 days. The half lives of fission fragments tend to be no longer than a
few tens of years so that after a period of several hundred years, their radioactivity
will decline to relatively insignificant levels.
Reactor wastes also include some radionuclides with very long half-lives. Of
major concern is plutonium, which has a half-life of 24,390 years. Only a few percent of the uranium atoms in reactor fuel is the fissile isotope 235U, whereas essentially all of the rest is 238U, which does not fission. Uranium-238 can, however,
capture a neutron and be transformed into plutonium as the following reactions
suggest:

This plutonium, along with several other long-lived radionuclides, makes nuclear wastes dangerously radioactive for tens of thousands of years and greatly increases the difficulty of providing safe disposal. Removing the plutonium from
nuclear wastes before disposal has been proposed as a way to shorten the decay
period but that introduces another problem. Plutonium not only is radioactive and
highly toxic, it is also the critical ingredient in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
A single nuclear reactor produces enough plutonium each year to make dozens of
small atomic bombs, and some have argued that if the plutonium is separated from
nuclear wastes, the risk of illicit diversions for such weapons would be unacceptable. Without reprocessing to reuse the plutonium and uranium in the spent fuel
rods, the nuclear fuel cycle is as diagrammed in Figure 11.
If reprocessing is included, the nuclear fuel system more closely approaches a
true cycle as shown in Figure 12. Reprocessing high-level wastes recovers unused
uranium and newly created plutonium that can be used to refuel reactors. The plutonium, however, also can be used for nuclear weapons. In a very controversial decision, Japan has begun to ship its nuclear wastes to France for reprocessing, and in
1995, the first shipments of recovered plutonium were transported back to Japan
for reuse in their nuclear program.
As Figures 11 and 12 suggest, the power reactor itself is only one of several
sources in the complete nuclear fuel cycle that creates waste disposal problems.
Uranium ores must first be mined and the uranium extracted. Mine tailings typically

contain toxic metals such as arsenic, cadmium, and mercury, as well as the radionuclides associated with the decay of 238U shown earlier in Figure 9. Only about
0.72 percent of naturally occurring uranium is the desired isotope 235U, and an enrichment facility is needed to increase that concentration to 2 or 3 percent for use in
reactors. The enriched uranium is then fabricated into fuel pellets and fuel rods that
are shipped to reactors. Highly radioactive wastes from reactors are temporarily
stored on site until, eventually, they will be transported to their ultimate disposal in
a federal repository. Such a repository, however, is not expected to become operational in the United States until well into the twenty-first century. Low-level wastes
can be disposed of in specially designed landfills. When the reactor has reached the
end of its lifetime, after roughly 30 years, it must be decommissioned, and radioactive components must be eventually transported to a secure disposal site.
Providing proper disposal of radioactive wastes at every stage in the nuclear
fuel cycle is a challenging engineering task, but many argue that it is well within our
capabilities.

(The preceding holds for pH values that are less than about 10; when you work out the
solution, check to see whether this was a valid assumption.) This calculation is the same
as would be made to estimate the pH of the oceans, which are saturated with CaCO3.

Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.

Introduction
A sense of the future is an essential component in the mix of factors that should be
influencing the environmental decisions we make today. In some circumstances,
only a few factors may need to be considered, and the time horizon may be relatively
short. For example, a wastewater treatment plant operator may need to predict the
growth rate of bacteria in a digester over a period of hours or days. The designer of
the plant, on the other hand, probably needs to estimate the local population
growth rate over the next decade or two in order to size the facility. At the other
extreme, to make even the crudest estimate of future carbon emissions and their
effect on global warming, scientists need to forecast population and economic
growth rates, anticipated improvements in energy efficiency, the global fossil fuel
resource base and the consumption rate of individual fuels, the rate of deforestation
or reforestation that could be anticipated, and so on. These estimates need to be
made for periods of time that are often measured in hundreds of years.
As Niels Bohr suggests in the preceding quote, we cannot expect to make accurate predictions of the future, especially when the required time horizon may be

extremely long. However, often simple estimates can be made that are robust enough
that the insight they provide is most certainly valid. We can say, for example, with
considerable certainty that world population growth at today’s rates cannot continue for another hundred years. We can also use simple mathematical models to
develop very useful “what if” scenarios: If population growth continues at a certain
rate, and if energy demand is proportional to economic activity, and so forth, then
the following would occur.
The purpose of this chapter is to develop some simple but powerful mathematical tools that can shed considerable light on the future of many environmental
problems. We begin with what is probably the most useful and powerful mathematical function encountered in environmental studies: the exponential function. Other
growth functions encountered often are also explored, including the logistic and the
Gaussian functions. Applications that will be demonstrated using these functions
include population growth, resource consumption, pollution accumulation, and
radioactive decay.

Exponential Growth
Exponential growth occurs in any situation where the increase in some quantity is
proportional to the amount currently present. This type of growth is quite common,
and the mathematics required to represent it is relatively simple, yet extremely
important. Exponential growth is a particular case of a first-order rate process. We
will approach this sort of growth first as discrete, year-by-year increases and then in
the more usual way as a continuous growth function.
Suppose something grows by a fixed percentage each year. For example, if we
imagine our savings at a bank earning 5 percent interest each year, compounded
once a year, then the amount of increase in savings over any given year is 5 percent
of the amount available at the beginning of that year. If we start now with $1,000,
then at the end of one year we would have $1,050 (1,000 + 0.05 * 1,000); at the
end of two years, we would have $1,102.50 (1,050 + 0.05 * 1,050); and so on.
This can be represented mathematically as follows:
N0 = initial amount
Nt = amount after t years
r = growth rate (fraction per year)
Then,
Nt + 1 = Nt + rNt = Nt(1 + r)
For example,
N1 = N0(1 + r); N2 = N1(1 + r) = N0(1 + r)2
and, in general,
Nt = N0(1 + r)t

EXAMPLE 1 U.S. Electricity Growth (Annual Compounding)
In 2005, the United States produced 4.0 * 1012 kWhr/yr of electricity. The average annual growth rate of U.S. electricity demand in the previous 15 years was
about 1.8 percent. (For comparison, it had been about 7 percent per year for
many decades before the 1973 oil embargo.) Estimate the electricity consumption
in 2050 if the 1.8 percent per year growth rate were to remain constant over
those 45 years.
Solution

From (1), we have
N45 = N0(1 + r)45
= 4.0 * 1012 * (1 + 0.018)45
= 8.93 * 1012 kWhr/yr

Continuous Compounding
For most events of interest in the environment, it is usually assumed that the growth
curve is a smooth, continuous function without the annual jumps that (1) is based
on. In financial calculations, this is referred to as continuous compounding. With
the use of a little bit of calculus, the growth curve becomes the true exponential
function that we will want to use most often.
One way to state the condition that leads to exponential growth is that the
quantity grows in proportion to itself; that is, the rate of change of the quantity N is
proportional to N. The proportionality constant r is called the rate of growth and
has units of (time - 1).

EXAMPLE 2 U.S. Electricity Growth (Continuous Compounding)
Suppose we repeat Example 1, but now consider the 1.8 percent growth rate to
be continuously compounded. Starting with the 2005 electricity consumption
of 4.0 * 1012 kWhr/yr, what would consumption be in 2050 if the growth rate
remains constant?
Solution

Using (3),
N = N0ert
= 4.0 * 1012 * e0.018 * 45
= 8.99 * 1012 kWhr/yr

Example 1, in which increments were computed once each year, and Example 2, in which growth was continuously compounded, have produced nearly
identical results. As either the period of time in question or the growth rate increases, the two approaches begin to diverge. At 12 percent growth, for example,
those answers would differ by nearly 50 percent. In general, it is better to express
growth rates as if they are continuously compounded so that (3) becomes the appropriate expression.

Doubling Time
Calculations involving exponential growth can sometimes be made without a calculator by taking advantage of the following special characteristic of the exponential
function. A quantity that is growing exponentially requires a fixed amount of time
to double in size, regardless of the starting point. That is, it takes the same amount
of time to grow from N0 to 2N0 as it does to grow from 2N0 to 4N0, and so on, as
shown in Figure 2.
The doubling time (td) of a quantity that grows at a fixed exponential rate r is easily derived. From (3) the doubling time can be found by setting N = 2N0 at t = td:
2N0 = N0ertd
Since N0 appears on both sides of the equation, it can be canceled out, which is
another way of saying the length of time required to double the quantity does not

depend on how much you start with. So canceling N0 and taking the natural log of
both sides gives
ln 2 = rtd

If the growth rate r is expressed as a percentage instead of as a fraction, we get the

(5)

Equation (5) is well worth memorizing; that is,
The length of time required to double a quantity growing at r percent is
about equal to 70 divided by r percent.
If your savings earn 7 percent interest, it will take about 10 years to double the
amount you have in the account. If the population of a country grows continuously
at 2 percent, then it will double in size in 35 years, and so on.
EXAMPLE 3 Historical World Population Growth Rate
It took about 300 years for the world’s population to increase from 0.5 billion to
4.0 billion. If we assume exponential growth at a constant rate over that period
of time, what would that growth rate be? Do this example first with a calculator
and (3), and then with the rule of thumb suggested in (5).

Using the rule of thumb approach given by (5), three doublings would be

Quantities that grow exponentially very quickly also increase in size at a deceptively fast rate. As Table 1 suggests, quantities growing at only a few percent per
year increase in size with incredible speed after just a few doubling times. For example, at the 1995 rate of world population growth (r = 1.5 percent), the doubling
time was about 46 years. If that rate were to continue for just 4 doubling times, or
184 years, world population would increase by a factor of 16, from 5.7 billion to
91 billion. In 20 doubling times, there would be 6 million billion (quadrillion) people, or more than one person for each square foot of surface area of the earth. The
absurdity of these figures simply points out the impossibility of the underlying assumption that exponential growth, even at this relatively low-sounding rate, could
continue for such periods of time.

Half-Life
When the rate of decrease of a quantity is proportional to the amount present, exponential growth becomes exponential decay. Exponential decay can be described
using either a reaction rate coefficient (k) or a half-life (t1>2), and the two are easily
related to each other. A reaction rate coefficient for an exponential decay plays the
same role that r played for exponential growth.
Exponential decay can be expressed as
N = N0e - kt

(7)

where k is a reaction rate coefficient (time - 1), N0 is an initial amount, and N is an
amount at time t.
A plot of (7) is shown in Figure 3 along with an indication of half-life. To relate half-life to reaction rate, we set N = N0 >2 at t = t1>2, giving
N0
= N0e - kt1>2

Canceling the N0 term and taking the natural log of both sides gives us the desired

Disaggregated Growth Rates
Often the quantity to be modeled can be considered to be the product of a number
of individual factors. For example, to estimate future carbon emissions, we might
disaggregate demand into the following three factors:
Carbon emissions = (Population) * a

Energy
Person

b * a

Carbon
b
Energy

(9)

By considering demand this way, we would hope to increase the accuracy of our
forecast by estimating separately the rates of change of population, per capita
energy consumption, and carbon emissions per unit of energy. Equation (9) is an example of the following simple conceptual model of factors that drive the environmental impacts of human activity:
Impacts = (Population) * (Affluence) * (Technology)

(10)

In (9), affluence is indicated by per capita energy demand, and technology is represented by the carbon emissions per unit of energy.
Expressing a quantity of interest as the product of individual factors, such as
has been done in (9), leads to a very simple method of estimating growth. We begin
with
P = P1P2 Á Pn

(11)

93

Mathematics of Growth

If each factor is itself growing exponentially
Pi = pierit
then
P = (p1er1t)(p2er2t) Á (pnernt)
= (p1p2 Á pn)e(r1 + r2 + Árn)t
which can be written as
P = P0ert
where
P0 = (p1p2 Á pn)

(12)

r = r1 + r2 + Á rn

(13)

and
Equation (13) is a very simple, very useful result. That is,
If a quantity can be expressed as a product of factors, each growing
exponentially, then the total rate of growth is just the sum of the individual growth rates.
EXAMPLE 5 Future U.S. Energy Demand
One way to disaggregate energy consumption is with the following product:
Energy demand = (Population) * a

Energy
GDP
b * a
b
person
GDP

GDP is the gross domestic product. Suppose we project per capita GDP to grow at
2.3 percent and population at 0.6 percent. Assume that through energy-efficiency
efforts, we expect energy required per dollar of GDP to decrease exponentially at the rate that it did between 1995 and 2005. In 1995, (energy/GDP) was
13.45 kBtu/$, and in 2005, it was 11.35 kBtu/$ (in constant 1987 dollars). Total
U.S. energy demand in 2005 was 100.2 quads (quadrillion Btu). If the aforementioned rates of change continue, what would energy demand be in the year 2020?
Solution First, find the exponential rate of decrease of (energy/GDP) over the
10 years between 1995 and 2005. Using (6) gives

Notice that the equation automatically produces the negative sign. The overall
energy growth rate is projected to be the sum of the three rates:
r = 0.6 + 2.3 - 1.7 = 1.2 percent
(For comparison, energy growth rates in the United States before the 1973 oil
embargo were typically 3 to 4 percent per year.) Projecting out 15 years to the
year 2020, (3) gives
Energy demand in 2020 = 100.2 * 1015 Btu/yr * e0.012 * 15
= 120 * 1015 Btu/yr = 120 quads/yr

Mathematics of Growth

Resource Consumption
To maintain human life on Earth, we depend on a steady flow of energy and materials to meet our needs. Some of the energy used is renewable (e.g., hydroelectric power, windpower, solar heating systems, and even firewood if the trees are
replanted), but most comes from depletable fossil fuels. The minerals extracted from
the Earth’s crust, such as copper, iron, and aluminum, are limited as well. The future
of our way of life to a large extent depends on the availability of abundant supplies
of inexpensive, depletable energy and materials.
How long will those resources last? The answer, of course, depends on how
much there is and how quickly we use it. We will explore two different ways to
model the rate of consumption of a resource: One is based on the simple exponential function that we have been working with, and the other is based on a more
realistic bell-shaped curve.

Exponential Resource Production Rates
When a mineral is extracted from the Earth, geologists traditionally say the resource
is being produced (rather than consumed). Plotting the rate of production of a
resource versus time, as has been illustrated in Figure 4, the area under the curve between any two times will represent the total resource that has been produced during
that time interval. That is, if P is the production rate (e.g., barrels of oil per day,
tonnes of aluminum per year, etc.), and Q is the resource produced (total barrels,
total tonnes) between times t1 and t2, we can write
t2

(14)
P dt
Lt1
Assuming that the production rate of a resource grows exponentially, we can
easily determine the total amount produced during any time interval; or, conversely,
if the total amount to be produced is known, we can estimate the length of time that
it will take to produce it. The basic assumption of exponential growth is probably
not a good one if the time frame is very long, but nonetheless, it will give us some
very useful insights. In the next section, we will work with a more reasonable production rate curve.
Figure 5 shows an exponential rate of growth in production. If the time
interval of interest begins with t = 0, we can write

where

P0 = the initial production rate
r = the exponential rate of growth in production
Equation (15) tells us how much of the resource is produced in a given period
of time if the production rate grows exponentially. If we want to know how long it
will take to produce a given amount of the resource, rearrange (15) to give

where t = the length of time required to produce an amount Q.
Applications of (16) often lead to startling results, as should be expected anytime we assume that exponential rates of growth will continue for a prolonged period of time.
EXAMPLE 6 World Coal Production
World coal production in 2005 was estimated to be 6.1 billion (short) tons per
year, and the estimated total recoverable reserves of coal were estimated at
1.1 trillion tons. Growth in world coal production in the previous decade averaged 1.9 percent per year. How long would it take to use up those reserves at
current production rates, and how long would it take if production continues to
grow at 1.9 percent?
Solution

At those rates, coal reserves would last
Reserves
1.1 * 1012 tons
=
= 180 years
Production
6.1 * 109 tons/yr

Mathematics of Growth

If production grows exponentially, we need to use (16):

6.1 * 109

Even though the growth rate of 1.9 percent might seem modest, compared to a
constant production rate, it cuts the length of time to deplete those reserves by
more than half.
Example 6 makes an important point: By simply dividing the remaining
amount of a resource by the current rate of production, we can get a misleading
estimate of the remaining lifetime for that resource. If exponential growth is assumed,
what would seem to be an abundant resource may actually be consumed surprisingly
quickly. Continuing this example for world coal, let us perform a sensitivity analysis
on the assumptions used. Table 2 presents the remaining lifetime of coal reserves, assuming an initial 2005 production rate of 6.1 billion tons per year, for various
estimates of total available supply and for differing rates of production growth.
Notice how the lifetime becomes less and less sensitive to estimates of the total
available resource as exponential growth rates increase. At a constant 3 percent
growth rate, for example, a total supply of 500 billion tons of coal would last
41 years; if our supply is four times as large, 2,000 billion tons, the resource only
lasts another 38 years. Having four times as much coal does not even double the
projected lifetime.
This is a good time to mention the important distinction between the reserves
of a mineral and the ultimately producible resources. As shown in Figure 6, reserves
are quantities that can reasonably be assumed to exist and are producible with existing technology under present economic conditions. Resources include present reserves as well as deposits not yet discovered or deposits that have been identified but
are not recoverable under present technological and economic conditions.
As existing reserves are consumed, further exploration, advances in extraction
technology, and higher acceptable prices constantly shift mineral resources into the
reserves category. Estimating the lifetime of a mineral based on the available reserves

rather than on the ultimately producible resources can therefore be misleading.
World oil reserves in 1970, for example, were estimated at 550 billion barrels (1 barrel equals 42 gallons) while production was 17 billion barrels per year. The reservesto-production ratio was about 32 years; that is, at 1970 production rates, those
reserves would be depleted in 32 years. However, 35 years later (2005), instead of
being out of reserves, they had grown to 1,300 billion barrels. Production in 2005
was 30.7 billion barrels per year, giving a reserves-to-production ratio of 42 years.

A Symmetrical Production Curve
We could imagine a complete production cycle to occur in many ways. The model of
exponential growth until the resource is totally consumed that we just explored is
just one example. It might seem an unlikely one since the day before the resource
collapses, the industry is at full production, and the day after, it is totally finished. It
is a useful model, however, to dispel any myths about the possibility of long-term
exponential growth in the consumption rate of any finite resource.
A more reasonable approach to estimating resource cycles was suggested by
M. King Hubbert (1969). Hubbert argued that consumption would more likely follow a course that might begin with exponential growth while the resource is abundant and relatively cheap. As new sources get harder to find, prices go up and
substitutions would begin to take some of the market. Eventually, consumption
rates would peak and then begin a downward trend as the combination of high
prices and resource substitutions would prevail. The decline could be precipitous
when the energy needed to extract and process the resource exceeds the energy
derived from the resource itself. A graph of resource consumption rate versus time
would therefore start at zero, rise, peak, and then decrease back to zero, with the
area under the curve equaling the total resource consumed.
Hubbert suggested that a symmetrical production rate cycle that resembles a
bell-shaped curve be used. One such curve is very common in probability theory,
where it is called the normal or Gaussian function. Figure 7 shows a graph of the
function and identifies some of the key parameters used to define it.

The parameter s is the standard deviation of a normal density function, and in
this application, it has units of time. Within ; 1 s away from the time of maximum
production, 68.3 percent of the production occurs; within ; 2 s, 95 percent of the
production occurs. Notice that with this bell-shaped curve, it is not possible to talk
about the resource ever being totally exhausted. It is more appropriate to specify the
length of time required for some major fraction of it to be used up. Hubbert uses
80 percent as his criterion, which corresponds to 1.3 s after the year of maximum
production.
We can find the total amount of the resource ever produced, Q q , by integrating (17)

Let us demonstrate the use of these equations by fitting a Gaussian curve to
data for U.S. coal resources.
EXAMPLE 7 U.S. Coal Production
Suppose ultimate total production of U.S. coal is double the 1995 recoverable reserves, which were estimated at 268 * 109 (short) tons. The U.S. coal production
rate in 1995 was 1.0 * 109 tons/year. How long would it take to reach a peak
production rate equal to four times the 1995 rate if a Gaussian production curve
is followed?

FIGURE 9 Two possible production rate curves for the world’s ultimately recoverable
crude oil resources, estimated by Hubbert in 1977 to be 2 trillion barrels. The original
Hubbert curve indicates that peak production would have been reached before the year
2000, whereas the “conservation” scenario, which holds production to the 1975 level as
long as possible, extends the resource for only a few decades more.
(Source: Hubbert, 1977.)

Hubbert’s analysis of world oil production is presented in Figure 9 for two scenarios. One scenario is based on fitting a Gaussian curve to the historical production record before 1975; the other is based on a conservation scenario in which oil
production follows the Gaussian curve until 1975 but then remains constant at the
1975 rate for as long as possible before a sudden decline takes place. With the bellshaped curve, world oil consumption would have peaked just before the year 2000;
with the conservation scenario, supplies would last until about 2040 before the decline would begin. The actual production curve between 1975 and 1995 fell between these two scenarios.
The curves drawn in Figure 9 were based on Hubbert’s 1977 estimate of 2,000
billion barrels of oil ultimately produced. For perspective, by 2005, approximately
1,000 billion barrels had been produced (and consumed), and proved reserves stood
at 1,300 billion barrels (two-thirds of which were in the Middle East). Amounts already produced plus proved reserves total 2,300 billion barrels, more than
Hubbert’s estimate for the total amount ever to be produced.
Will more oil ultimately be produced than the current 1.3 trillion barrels of
proved reserves? Finding new sources, using enhanced oil recovery techniques to
remove some of the oil that is now left behind, and eventually tapping into unconventional hydrocarbon resources such as extra heavy oil, bitumen, and shale oil
could stretch petroleum supplies much farther into the future but at significantly
higher environmental and economic costs.

Population Growth
The simple exponential growth model can serve us well for short time horizons, but
obviously, even small growth rates cannot continue for long before environmental
constraints limit further increases.
The typical growth curve for bacteria, shown in Figure 10, illustrates some of
the complexities that natural biological systems often exhibit. The growth curve is
divided into phases designated as lag, exponential, stationary, and death. The lag
phase, characterized by little or no growth, corresponds to an initial period of time
when bacteria are first inoculated into a fresh medium. After the bacteria have
adjusted to their new environment, a period of rapid growth, the exponential phase,
follows. During this time, conditions are optimal, and the population doubles with
great regularity. (Notice that the vertical scale in Figure 10 is logarithmic so that
exponential growth produces a straight line.) As the bacterial food supply begins to
be depleted, or as toxic metabolic products accumulate, the population enters the
no-growth, or stationary phase. Finally, as the environment becomes more and more
hostile, the death phase is reached and the population declines.

Logistic Growth
Population projections are often mathematically modeled with a logistic or S-shaped
(sigmoidal) growth curve such as the one shown in Figure 11. Such a curve has great
intuitive appeal. It suggests an early exponential growth phase while conditions for
growth are optimal, followed by slower and slower growth as the population nears
the carrying capacity of its environment. Biologists have successfully used logistic
curves to model populations of many organisms, including protozoa, yeast cells,
water fleas, fruit flies, pond snails, worker ants, and sheep (Southwick, 1976).
Mathematically, the logistic curve is derived from the following differential

FIGURE 11 The logistic growth curve suggests a smooth transition from exponential
growth to a steady-state population.

where N is population size, K is called the carrying capacity of the environment, and
r is the exponential growth rate constant that would apply if the population size is
far below the carrying capacity. Strictly speaking, r is the growth rate constant when
N = 0; the population is zero. However, when population is much less than carrying capacity, population growth can be modeled with a rate constant r without
significant error. As N increases, the rate of growth slows down, and eventually, as
N approaches K, the growth stops altogether, and the population stabilizes at a level
equal to the carrying capacity. The factor (1 - N>K) is often called the environmental resistance. As population grows, the resistance to further population growth
continuously increases.
The solution to (21) is
N =

K
1 + e - r(t - t*)

(22)

Note that t* corresponds to the time at which the population is half of the carrying
capacity, N = K>2. Substituting t = 0 into (22) lets us solve for t*. Applying the relationship into (22), we can derive the integrated expression of (21) as
N(t) =

KN0
N0 + (K - N0)e - rt

(23)

where N0 is the population at time t = 0. In the usual application of (23), the population growth rate is known at t = 0. However, the rate constant for this growth
rate is not the same as the rate constant r. It cannot necessarily be assumed that the
effect of environmental resistance on the growth rate is negligible. To find r from the
growth rate measured at t = 0, the factor R0 is introduced. Let R0 = instantaneous
rate constant at t = 0 (but not necessarily when N V K). If we characterize growth
at t = 0 as exponential, then

so that equating (24) with (25) yields

(26)

Equation (26) lets us use quantities that are known at t = 0, namely the population size N0 and the population growth constant R0, to find the appropriate
growth constant r for (23). The relationship between the exponential rate constants
r and R0 can be confusing. Remember, there is a different R0 corresponding to each
value of N0, but r has a single value corresponding to the exponential growth that
occurs only when N0 = 0. It may help to think of r as the intrinsic rate constant for
the particular logistic growth curve, as shown in (21), and R0 as a provisional rate
constant for the instantaneous growth rate at any time, if the growth is assumed to
be exponential (and not logistic).
The following example demonstrates the application of the logistic growth
model.
EXAMPLE 8 Logistic Human Population Curve
Suppose the human population follows a logistic curve until it stabilizes at
15.0 billion. In 2006, the world’s population was 6.6 billion, and its growth rate
was 1.2 percent. When would the population reach 7.5 billion—one half of its
assumed carrying capacity?
Solution

to solve for t:
t =

N(K - N0)

ln a

r
N0(K - N)

(27)

Now substitute N0 = 6.6 billion and N(t) = 7.5 billion into (27)

b = 11 yrs
0.0214
6.6 * 109(15 * 109 - 7.5 * 109)

The Earth would reach one-half its carrying capacity in 2017.

Maximum Sustainable Yield
The logistic curve can also be used to introduce another useful concept in population biology called the maximum sustainable yield of an ecosystem. The maximum
sustainable yield is the maximum rate that individuals can be harvested (removed)
without reducing the population size. Imagine, for example, harvesting fish from a
pond. If the pond is at its carrying capacity, there will be no population growth. Any
fish removed will reduce the population. Therefore, the maximum sustainable yield

104

Mathematics of Growth

will correspond to some population less than the carrying capacity. In fact, because
the yield is the same as dN>dt, the maximum yield will correspond to the point on
the logistic curve where the slope is a maximum (its inflection point). Setting the
derivative of the slope equal to zero, we can find that point. The slope of the logistic
curve is given by (21):
Yield = Slope =

(for maximum sustainable yield)

(28)

That is, if population growth is logistic, then the maximum sustainable yield will be
obtained when the population is half the carrying capacity. The yield at that point
can be determined by substituting (28) into (21):

EXAMPLE 9 Harvesting Fish
Observations of a pond newly stocked with 100 fish shows their population doubles in the first year, but after many years, their population stabilizes at 4,000 fish.
Assuming a logistic growth curve, what would be the maximum sustainable yield
from this pond?
Solution In the first year, with no harvesting, the population doubles. One
approach is to estimate the initial growth rate constant, R0, from the doubling
time equation (5):
R0 =

ln 2
ln 2
=
= 0.693 yr - 1
td
1 yr

Since R0 is an instantaneous rate, it conceptually only applies for a single value of
N, not for all values of N (100–200 fish) occurring during the first year. A good

105

Mathematics of Growth

estimate of the appropriate population size corresponding to the value of R0 calculated would be the midpoint population for the year, 150 fish. However, as is
often done, N0 could also be taken as 100 fish (the initial population for the
period in which the growth rate was measured) without significant error. So from
(30) the maximum yield would be

4(K - N0)
4(4,000 - 150 fish)

If we had used 100 fish for N0, the maximum sustainable yield would have been
calculated as 710 fish/yr, showing there will only be a small error in the final
answer as long as the initial population is small relative to the carrying capacity.
This suggests a more intuitive way we could have gone about this because the
initial population, N0, is much lower than the carrying capacity, K. In this case,
the instantaneous growth rate constant, R0, is approximately equal to the growth
rate constant, r, when there is no environmental resistance. That is, r L R0 =
0.693>yr. Using this approximation along with the fact that population size
when yield is highest is K>2 = 2,000 fish, from (21) we have

Human Population Growth
The logistic growth equations just demonstrated are frequently used with some degree of accuracy and predictive capability for density-dependent populations, but
they are not often used to predict human population growth. More detailed information on fertility and mortality rates and population age composition are usually
available for humans, increasing our ability to make population projections. Use of
such data enables us to ask such questions as: What if every couple had just two
children? What if such replacement level fertility were to take 40 years to achieve?
What would be the effect of reduced fertility rates on the ratios of retired people to
workers in the population? The study of human population dynamics is known as
demography, and what follows is but a brief glimpse at some of the key definitions
and most useful mathematics involved.
The simplest measure of fertility is the crude birth rate, which is just the number of live births per 1,000 population in a given year. It is called crude because it
does not take into account the fraction of the population that is physically capable
of giving birth in any given year. The crude birth rate is typically in the range of 30
to 40 per 1,000 per year for the poorest, least developed countries of the world,
whereas it is typically around 10 for the more developed ones. For the world as a
whole, in 2006, the crude birth rate was 21 per 1,000. That means the 6.56 billion
people alive then would have had about 6.56 * 109 * (21>1,000) = 138 million
live births in that year. (These statistics, and most others in this section, are taken
from data supplied by the Population Reference Bureau in a most useful annual
publication called the 2006 World Population Data Sheet.)

FIGURE 12 Annual births and total fertility rate in the United States.
(Source: Bouvier and De Vita, 1991.)

The total fertility rate (TFR) is the average number of children that would be
born alive to a woman, assuming current age-specific birth rates remain constant
through the woman’s reproductive years. It is a good measure of the average number of children each woman is likely to have during her lifetime. In the developed
countries of the world in 2006, the total fertility rate was 1.6 children per female,
whereas in the less developed countries, the average was 2.9. In some of the poorest
countries, the TFR is more than 6 children per woman. Figure 12 shows the history
of the TFR for the United States. During the depression years of the 1930s, TFR was
barely above 2; during the baby-boom era, from 1946 to 1964, it was well over 3
children per woman; in the mid-1970s, it dropped back to a level close to 2.
The number of children that a woman must have, on the average, to replace
herself with one daughter in the next generation is called replacement level fertility.
Replacement level fertility accounts for differences in the ratio of male to female
births as well as child mortality rates. For example, in the United States, replacement level fertility is 2.11 children per female. At that fertility level, 100 women
would bear 211 children on the average. Statistically, 108 of the children would be
boys and 103 would be girls. About 3 percent of the girls would be expected to die
before bearing children, leaving a net of 100 women in the next generation. Notice
that differing mortality rates in other countries cause the replacement level of fertility to vary somewhat compared to the 2.11 just described. In many developing
countries, for example, higher infant mortality rates raise the level of fertility needed
for replacement to approximately 2.7 children.
As will be demonstrated later, having achieved replacement level fertility does
not necessarily mean a population has stopped growing. When a large fraction of
the population is young people, as they pass through their reproductive years, the
total births will continue to grow despite replacement fertility. Figure 12 illustrates
this concept for the United States. Even though replacement level fertility had been
achieved by the mid-1970s, the total number of births rose as the baby boomers had

107

Mathematics of Growth

their children. The cohorts born between 1981 and 1995 are often referred to as the
baby boom echo. The continuation of population growth, despite achievement of
replacement level fertility, is a phenomenon known as population momentum, and it
will be described more carefully a bit later in the chapter.
The simplest measure of mortality is the crude death rate, which is the number
of deaths per 1,000 population per year. Again, caution should be exercised in interpreting crude death rates because the age composition of the population is not
accounted for. The United States, for example, has a higher crude death rate than
Guatemala, but that in no way indicates equivalent risks of mortality. In Guatemala,
only 4 percent of the population is over 65 years of age (and hence at greater risk of
dying), whereas in the United States, a much large fraction of the population,
12 percent, is over 65.
An especially important measure of mortality is the infant mortality rate,
which is the number of deaths to infants (under 1 year of age) per 1,000 live births
in a given year. The infant mortality rate is one of the best indicators of poverty in a
country. In some of the poorest countries of the world, infant mortality rates are
over 140, which means 1 child in 7 will not live to see his or her first birthday. In the
more developed countries, infant mortality rates are around 6 per 1,000 per year.

EXAMPLE 10 Birth and Death Statistics
In 2006, over 80 percent of the world’s population, some 5.3 billion people, lived
in the less developed countries of the world. In those countries, the average crude
birth rate was 23, crude death rate was 8.5, and the infant mortality rate was 53.
What fraction of the total deaths is due to infant mortality? If the less developed
countries were able to care for their infants as well as they are cared for in most
developed countries, resulting in an infant mortality rate of 6, how many infant
deaths would be avoided each year?
Solution To find the number of infant deaths each year, we must first find the
number of live births and then multiply that by the fraction of those births that
die within the first year:
Now:
Infant Deaths = Population * Crude Birth Rate * Infant Mortality Rate
= 5.3 * 109 * (23>1,000) * (53>1,000) = 6.5 * 106 per year
Total Deaths = Population * Crude Death Rate
= 5.3 * 109 * (8>1,000) = 42.4 * 106 per year
Fraction Infants = 6.5>42.4 = 0.15 = 15 percent
With lowered infant mortality rate:
Infant Deaths = 5.3 * 109 * (23>1,000) * (6>1,000) = 0.73 * 106 per year
Avoided Deaths = (6.5 - 0.73) * 106 = 5.8 million per year

108

Mathematics of Growth

It is often argued that reductions in the infant mortality rate would eventually
result in reduced birth rates as people began to gain confidence that their offspring would be more likely to survive. Hence, the reduction of infant mortality
rates through such measures as better nutrition, cleaner water, and better medical
care is thought to be a key to population stabilization.
The difference between crude birth rate b and crude death rate d is called the
rate of natural increase of the population. While it can be expressed as a rate per
1,000 of population, it is more common to express it either as a decimal fraction or
as a percentage rate. As a simple, but important equation,
r = b - d

(31)

where r is the rate of natural increase. If r is treated as a constant, then the exponential relationships developed earlier can be used. For example, in 2006, the crude
birth rate for the world was 21 per 1,000, and the crude death rate was 9 per
1,000, so the rate of natural increase was (21 - 9)>1,000 = 12>1,000 = 0.012 =
1.2 percent. If this rate continues, then the world would double in population in
about 70>1.2 = 58 years.
Although it is reasonable to talk in terms of a rate of natural increase for the
world, it is often necessary to include effects of migration when calculating growth
rates for an individual country. Letting m be the net migration rate, which is the difference between immigration (in-migration) and emigration (out-migration), we can
rewrite the preceding relationship as follows:

At the beginning of the industrial revolution, it is thought that crude birth
rates were around 40 per 1,000, and death rates were around 35 per 1,000, yielding
a rate of natural increase of about 0.5 percent for the world. As parts of the world
began to achieve the benefits of a better and more assured food supply, improved
sanitation, and modern medicines, death rates began to drop. As economic and
social development has proceeded in the currently more developed countries, crude
birth rates have fallen to about 12 per 1,000 and crude death rates to about 10 per
1,000. These countries have undergone what is referred to as the demographic
transition, a transition from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates,
as shown in Figure 13.
The less developed countries of the world have also experienced a sizable drop
in death rates, especially during the last half century. Imported medicines and better
control of disease vectors have contributed to a rather sudden drop in death rates to
their 2006 level of 8 per 1,000. In general, birth rates have not fallen nearly as fast,
however. They are still up around 23 per 1,000, which yields a growth rate of
1.5 percent for over 80 percent of the world’s population. The rapid (and historically speaking, extraordinary) population growth that the world is experiencing
now is almost entirely due to the drop in death rates in developing countries without
a significant corresponding drop in birth rates. Many argue that decreases in fertility
depend on economic growth, and many countries today face the danger that economic growth may not be able to exceed population growth. Such countries may be

temporarily stuck in the middle of the demographic transition and are facing the
risk that population equilibrium may ultimately occur along the least desirable path,
through rising death rates.
One developing country that stands out from the others is China. After experiencing a disastrous famine from 1958 to 1961, China instituted aggressive family
planning programs coupled with improved health care and living standards that cut
birth rates in half in less than 2 decades. Figure 14 shows China’s rapid passage
through the demographic transition, which was unprecedented in speed (the developed countries took more than 100 years to make the transition).
Some of these data on fertility and mortality are presented in Table 3 for the
world, for more developed countries, for China, and for the less developed countries
excluding China. China has been separated out because, in terms of population
control, it is so different from the rest of the less developed countries and because its
size so greatly influences the data.

age category, is called an age structure or a population pyramid. An age structure
diagram is a snapshot of a country’s population trends that tells a lot about the
recent past as well as the near future. Developing countries with rapidly expanding
populations, for example, have pyramids that are triangular in shape, with each
cohort larger than the cohort born before it. An example pyramid is shown in Figure 15 for Morocco. It is not uncommon in such countries to have nearly half of the
population younger than 15 years old. The age structure shows that even if
replacement fertility is achieved in the near future, there are so many young women
already born who will be having their children that population size will continue to
grow for many decades.
The second pyramid in Figure 15 is an example of a population that is not
growing very rapidly, if at all. Notice that the sides of the structure are much more
vertical. There is also a pinching down of the age structure in the younger years, suggesting a fertility rate below replacement level, so that if these trends continue, the
population will eventually begin to decrease.
Two important terms are used by demographers to describe the shape of an
age structure. A stable population has had constant age-specific birth and death
rates for such a long time that the percentage of the population in any age category
does not change. That is, the shape of the age structure is unchanging. A population
that is stable does not have to be fixed in size; it can be growing or shrinking at a
constant rate. When a population is both stable and unchanging in size it is called a
stationary population. Thus all stationary populations are stable, but not all stable
populations are stationary.

FIGURE 16 The age structure for the United States in 2000.
(Source: U.S. Census Bureau.)

The population pyramid for the United States in 2000 is shown in Figure 16.
The nearly vertical sides on the lower part of the pyramid suggest that this is a population that is well underway toward a stationary condition. The dominant feature,
however, is the bulge in the middle corresponding to the baby-boom cohorts born
between 1946 and 1964. Thinking of the age structure as a dynamic phenomenon,
the bulge moving upward year after year suggests an image of a python that has
swallowed a pig, which slowly works its way through the snake. As the boomers
pass through the age structure, resources are stretched to the limit. When they entered school, there were not enough classrooms and teachers, so new schools were
built and teacher training programs expanded. When they left, schools closed, and
there was an oversupply of teachers. Universities found themselves competing for
smaller and smaller numbers of high school graduates. During their late teens and
early twenties, arrest rates increased since those are the ages that are, statistically
speaking, responsible for the majority of crimes. As they entered the workforce,
competition was fierce and unemployment rates were persistently high, housing was
scarce, and the price of real estate jumped. The baby-boom generation is now nearing retirement, and there is a boom in construction of retirement communities coupled with growing concern about the capability of the social security system to
accommodate so many retirees.
By contrast, children born in the 1930s, just ahead of the baby-boom generation, are sometimes referred to as the “good times cohorts.” Since there are so few
of them, as they sought their educations, entered the job market, bought homes, and
are now retiring, the competition for those resources has been relatively modest.
Children born in the 1970s also benefit by being part of a narrow portion of the age

Human Population Projections
If the age structure for a population is combined with data on age-specific birth and
death rates, it is possible to make realistic projections of future population size and
composition. The techniques that we will explore now are especially useful for predicting the effects and implications of various changes in fertility patterns that might
be imagined or advocated. For example, suppose we want to determine the effects of
replacement-level fertility. If replacement fertility were achieved today, how long
would it take to achieve a stationary population? What would the age composition
look like in the interim? What fraction of the population would be young and looking for work, and what fraction would be retired and expecting support? Or suppose a policy is established that sets a target for maximum size of the population (as
is the case for China). How many children would each couple need to have to
achieve that goal, and how would the number change with time?
Not long ago, the calculations required to develop these scenarios were tedious
and best left to professional demographers. Now, however, with the widespread use
of simple spreadsheet programs on personal computers, it is possible to work them
out with relative ease.
The starting point in a population projection is the current age structure combined with mortality data obtained from life tables. Life tables are the mainstay of
insurance companies for predicting the average number of years of life remaining as
a function of the age of their clients. A life table is developed by applying a real population’s age-specific death rates (the fraction of the people in a given age category
who will die each year) to hypothetical stable and stationary populations having
100,000 live births per year, evenly distributed through the year, with no migration.
As the 100,000 people added each year get older, their ranks are thinned in accordance with the age-specific death rates. It is then possible to calculate the numbers
of people who would be alive within each age category in the following year.
Table 4 presents a life table for the United States that has been simplified by
broadening the age intervals to 5-year increments rather than the 1-year categories
used by insurance companies and demographers. These data, remember, are for a
hypothetical population with 100,000 live births each year (and 100,000 deaths
each year as well since this is a stationary population). The first column shows the
age interval (e.g., 10–14 means people who have had their tenth birthday but not
their fifteenth). The second column is the number of people who would be alive at
any given time in the corresponding age interval and is designated Lx, where x is the
age at the beginning of the interval. The third column, Lx + 5 >Lx, is the ratio of number of people in the next interval to the number in the current interval; it is the probability that individuals will live 5 more years (except in the case of those 80 and
older, where the catch-all category of 85+ years old modifies the interpretation).
If we assume that the age-specific death rates that were used to produce
Table 4 remain constant, we can use the table to make future population projections
at five-year intervals for all but the 0–4 age category. The 0–4 age category will depend on fertility data, to be discussed later.
If we let Px(0) be the number of people in age category x to x + 5 at time
t = 0, and Px + 5(5) be the number in the next age category five years later, then
Px + 5(5) = Px(0)

That is, five years from now, the number of people in the next five-year age interval
will be equal to the number in the interval now times the probability of surviving for
the next five years (Lx + 5 >Lx).
For example, in the United States in 1985, there were 18.0 million people in
the age group 0–4 years; that is, P0(1985) = 18.0 million. We would expect that in
1990, the number of people alive in the 5–9 age category would be
P5(1990) = P0(1985)(L5 >L0)
= 18.0 * 106 * 0.9979 = 17.98 million
Let’s take what we have and apply it to the age composition of the United
States in 1985 to predict as much of the structure as we can for 1990. This involves
application of (33) to all of the categories, giving us a complete 1990 age distribution except for the 0–4 year olds. The result is presented in Table 5.
To find the number of children ages 0–4 to enter into the age structure, we
need to know something about fertility patterns. Demographers use age-specific
fertility rates, which are the number of live births per woman in each age category,
to make these estimates. To do this calculation carefully, we would need to know the
number of people in each age category who are women as well as statistical data on
child mortality during the first five years of life. Since our purpose here is to develop
a tool for asking questions of the “what if” sort, rather than making actual population projections, we can use the following simple approach to estimate the number

where bx is the number of the surviving children born per person in age category x
to x + 5. Equation (34) has been written with the assumption that no children are
born to individuals under 15 or over 49 years of age, although it could obviously
have been written with more terms to include them. Notice that we can interpret the
sum of bx’s (©bx) to be the number of children each person would be likely to have.
The total fertility rate, which is the expected number of children per woman, is
therefore close to 2©bx.
For example, these fertility factors and the numbers of people in their reproductive years for the United States in 1985 are shown in Table 6. The total fertility
rate can be estimated as 2©bx, which is 2 * 1.004 = 2.01 children per woman.
With this 20,385,000 added to the 227,684,000 found in Table 5, the total
population in the United States in 1990 would have been 248,069,000. Notice that,
in spite of the fact that fertility was essentially at the replacement level in 1985, the
population would still be growing by about 2 million people per year. This is an
example of population momentum, a term used to describe the fact that a youthful

age structure causes a population to continue growing for several decades after
achieving replacement fertility. To finish off the aforementioned estimate, we would
have to add in net migration, which is currently 897,000 legal immigrants per year
plus probably hundreds of thousands of immigrants entering the country illegally.

Population Momentum
Let us begin with an extremely simplified example, which does not model reality
very well, but which does keep the arithmetic manageable. We will then see the
results of more carefully done population scenarios.
Suppose we have an age structure with only three categories: 0–24 years,
25–49 years, and 50–74 years, subject to the following fertility and mortality
conditions:
1. All births occur to women as they leave the 0–24 age category.
2. All deaths occur at age 75.
3. The total fertility rate (TFR) is 4.0 for 25 years; then it drops instantaneously
to 2.0.
Suppose a population of 5.0 billion people has an age structure at time t = 0,
as shown in Figure 18a. Equal numbers of men and women are assumed so that the
number of children per person is half the TFR. During the first 25 years, the 2.5 billion people who start in the 0–24 age category all pass their twenty-fifth birthday,
and all of their children are born. Because TFR is 4.0, these 2.5 billion individuals
bear 5.0 billion children (2 per person). Those 2.5 billion people now are in the
25–49 age category. Similarly, the 1.5 billion people who were 25–49 years old are
now ages 50–74. Finally, the 1.0 billion 50–74 year olds have all passed their seventy-fifth birthdays and, by the rules, they are all dead. The total population has
grown to 9.0 billion, and the age structure is as shown in Figure 18b.
After the first 25 years have passed, TFR drops to the replacement level of 2.0
(1 child per person). During the ensuing 25 years, the 5.0 billion 0–24 year olds have
5.0 billion children and, following the logic given previously, the age structure at
t = 50 years is as shown in Figure 18c. With the replacement level continuing,
at t = 75 years, the population stabilizes at 15 billion. A plot of population versus
time is shown in Figure 19. Notice that the population stabilizes 50 years after

15 billion.
A more carefully done set of population scenarios is presented in Figure 20. In
the constant-path scenario, population is assumed to continue growing at the 1980
growth rate into the indefinite future. The slow fertility-reduction path assumes that
the world’s fertility will decline to reach replacement level by 2065, which results in
a stabilized population of about 14 billion by the end of the twenty-first century.
The moderate fertility-reduction path assumes that replacement-level fertility will be
reached by 2035, with the population stabilizing at about 10 billion. Finally, the

World population in 1850 has been estimated at about 1 billion. World population
reached 4 billion in 1975.
(a) Use the doubling time approximation (5) to estimate the exponential rate of growth
that would produce those numbers.
(b) Use the exponential growth equation (6) to find the growth rate.
Tuition at a major university rose from $1,500/yr in 1962 to $20,000/yr in 1995.
(a) What exponential rate of growth characterized that period of time?
(b) If that growth rate were to continue for another 25 years (enough time for current
students to have children in college!) what would the tuition be?

The world’s population 10,000 years ago has been estimated at about 5 million. What
exponential rate of growth would have resulted in the population in 1850, which is estimated at 1 billion? Had that rate continued, what would the population have been in the
year 2000?
Suppose we express the amount of land under cultivation as the product of four factors:
Land = (land/food) * (food/kcal) * (kcal/person) * (population)

5

The annual growth rates for each factor are (1) the land required to grow a unit of food,
-1 percent (due to greater productivity per unit of land); (2) the amount of food grown
per calorie of food eaten by a human, +0.5 percent (because with affluence, people consume more animal products, which greatly reduces the efficiency of land use); (3) the per
capita calorie consumption, +0.1 percent; and (4) the size of the population, +1.5 percent. At these rates, how long would it take to double the amount of cultivated land
needed? At that time, how much less land would be required to grow a unit of food?
Suppose world carbon emissions are expressed as the following product:
Carbon emissions = (energy>person) * (carbon>energy) * (population)

If per capita energy demand increases at 1.5 percent per year, fossil fuel emissions of
carbon per unit of energy increase at 1 percent per year, and world population grows at
1.5 percent per year,
(a) How long would it take before we are emitting carbon at twice the current rate?
(b) At that point, by what fraction would per capita energy demand have increased?
(c) At that point, by what fraction would total energy demand have increased?
Under the assumptions stated in Problem 5, if our initial rate of carbon emission is
5 * 109 tonnes C/yr and if there are 700 * 109 tonnes of carbon in the atmosphere now,
(a) How long would it take to emit a total amount of carbon equal to the amount now
contained in the atmosphere?
(b) If half of the carbon that we emit stays in the atmosphere (the other half being
“absorbed” in other parts of the biosphere), how long would it take for fossil fuel
combustion to double the atmospheric carbon concentration?

World reserves of chromium are about 800 million tons, and current usage is about
2 million tons per year. If growth in demand for chromium increases exponentially at a
constant rate of 2.6 percent per year, how long would it take to use up current reserves?
Suppose the total resource is five times current reserves; if the use rate continues to grow
at 2.6 percent, how long would it take to use up the resource?
Suppose a Gaussian curve is used to approximate the production of chromium. If production peaks at six times its current rate of 2 million tons per year, how long would it take to
reach that maximum if the total chromium ever mined is 4 billion tons (five times the current reserves)? How long would it take to consume about 80 percent of the total resource?
Suppose we assume the following:
(a) Any chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) released into the atmosphere remain in the atmosphere indefinitely.
(b) At current rates of release, the atmospheric concentration of fluorocarbons would
double in 100 years (what does that say about Q>P0?).
(c) Atmospheric release rates are, however, not constant but growing at 2 percent per
year. How long would it take to double atmospheric CFC concentrations?
Bismuth-210 has a half-life of 4.85 days. If we start with 10 g of it now, how much would
we have left in 7 days?
Suppose some sewage drifting down a stream decomposes with a reaction rate coefficient
k equal to 0.2/day. What would be the half-life of this sewage? How much would be left
after 5 days?
Suppose human population grows from 6.3 billion in 2000 to an ultimate population of
10.3 billion following the logistic curve. Assuming a growth rate of 1.5 percent in 2000,
when would the population reach 9 billion? What would the population be in 2050?
Compare this to the moderate fertility reduction scenario of Figure 20.
Suppose a logistic growth curve had been used to project the world’s population back in
1970, when there were 3.65 billion people, and the growth rate was 2.0 percent per year.
If a steady-state population of 10.3 billion had been used (the moderate path in Figure 20), what would the projected population have been for 1995 (when it was actually
5.7 billion) and for 2025?
Suppose we stock a pond with 100 fish and note that the population doubles in the first
year (with no harvesting), but after a number of years, the population stabilizes at what
we think must be the carrying capacity of the pond, 2,000 fish. Growth seems to have
followed a logistic curve.
(a) What population size should be maintained to achieve maximum yield, and what
would be the maximum sustainable fish yield?
(b) If the population is maintained at 1,500 fish, what would be the sustainable yield?
What would be the sustainable yield from the pond in Example 9 if the population is
maintained at 3,000 fish?
A lake has a carrying capacity of 10,000 fish. At the current level of fishing, 2,000 fish per
year are taken with the catch uniformly distributed throughout the year. It is seen that the
fish population holds fairly constant at about 4,000. If you wanted to maximize the sustainable yield, what would you suggest in terms of population size and yield?
Suppose we stock an island with 250 rabbits and find that the population is 450 after one
year (with no harvesting). After a number of years, the population stabilizes at what we

think must be the carrying capacity of the island, 3,500 rabbits. Assume growth has followed a logistic curve.
(a) We now want to start harvesting the rabbits to sell, with the objective of harvesting
the most rabbits possible per year from the island. What population size should be
maintained to achieve the maximum sustainable yield and what would be the maximum sustainable rabbit yield?
(b) If the population is maintained at 1,200 rabbits, what would be the sustainable yield?
The Upset National Forest has a carrying capacity of 7,000 deer. At the current level of
recreational hunting, 300 deer per year are taken during a 2-week hunting season. After
the season, the deer population is always about 2,200 deer. You want to maximize the
sustainable yield of deer from the forest.
(a) What should be the population of deer in the forest for maximum sustainable yield?
(b) What will be the maximum sustainable yield of deer from the forest?
(c) If hunting were stopped so no further deer were taken from the forest, how long
would it take for the population size to reach the population (the population you
calculated in part (a)) that is necessary for maximum sustainable yield?
The following statistics are for India in 1985: population, 762 million; crude birth rate, 34;
crude death rate, 13; infant mortality rate, 118 (rates are per thousand per year). Find
(a) the fraction of the total deaths that are infants less than 1 year old; (b) the avoidable
deaths, assuming that any infant mortality above 10 could be avoided with better sanitation, food, and health care; and (c) the annual increase in the number of people in India.
The following statistics are for India in 1995: population, 931 million; crude birth rate,
29; crude death rate, 9; infant mortality rate, 74 (rates are per thousand per year). Find
(a) the fraction of the total deaths that are infants less than 1 year old; (b) the avoidable
deaths, assuming that any infant mortality above 10 could be avoided with better sanitation, food, and health care; and (c) the annual increase in the number of people in India.
(For comparison, in 1985, the population was growing at 16 million per year, and the
avoidable deaths were 2.8 million per year.)
Consider a simplified age structure that divides a population into three age groups: 0–24,
with 3.0 million; 25–49, with 2.0 million; and 50–74, with 1.0 million. Suppose we impose the following simplified fertility and mortality constraints: All births occur just as the
woman leaves the 0–24 age category, and no one dies until their seventy-fifth birthday, at
which time they all die. Suppose we have replacement-level fertility starting now. Draw
the age structure in 25 years, 50 years, and 75 years. What is the total population size at
each of these times?
Use the same initial population structure given in Problem 22, with all births on the mothers twenty-fifth birthday. Draw the age structure in 25, 50, and 75 years under the following conditions: No deaths occur until the fiftieth birthday, at which time 20 percent
die; the rest die on their seventy-fifth birthday. For the first 25 years, the total fertility rate
is 4 (2 children/person), and thereafter it is 2.
Consider the following simplified age structure: All births are on the mothers twentieth
birthday and all deaths are on the sixtieth birthday. Total population starts at 290,000
(half males, half females) and is growing at a constant rate of 3.5 percent per year (see
Figure P24). (Hint: what does that say about the doubling time?)
Draw the age structure in 20 years. If the total fertility rate is a single, constant value during those 20 years, what is it?

births by 10 years.
The birth-rate data for China in Problem 25 were for the very optimistic one-child per family scenario (TFR = 1). In reality, the TFR has been closer to 2. Assuming that each

Introduction
One of the most important changes in environmental policy in the 1980s was the
acceptance of the role of risk assessment and risk management in environmental
decision making. In early environmental legislation, such as the Clean Air and Clean
Water Acts, the concept of risk is hardly mentioned; instead, these acts required that
pollution standards be set that would allow adequate margins of safety to protect
public health. Intrinsic to these standards was the assumption that pollutants have
thresholds and that exposure to concentrations below these thresholds would produce no harm. All of that changed when the problems of toxic waste were finally
recognized and addressed. Many toxic substances are suspected carcinogens; that is,
they may cause cancer, and for carcinogens, the usual assumption is that even the
smallest exposure creates some risk.

Risk Assessment

If any exposure to a substance causes some risk, how can air quality and water
quality standards be set? When cleaning up a hazardous waste site, at what point is
the project completed; that is, how clean is clean? At some point in the cleanup, the
remaining health and environmental risks may not justify the continued costs and,
from a risk perspective, society might be better off spending the money elsewhere.
Almost by definition, achieving zero risk would cost an infinite amount of money,
so policy makers have had to grapple with the tradeoff between acceptable risk and
acceptable cost. Complicating those decisions is our very limited understanding of
diseases such as cancer coupled with a paucity of data on the tens of thousands of
synthetic chemicals that are in widespread use today. Unfortunately, those who have
responsibility for creating and administering environmental regulations have to take
action even if definitive answers from the scientific community on the relationship
between exposure and risk are not available.
The result has been the emergence of the controversial field of environmental
risk assessment. Hardly anyone is comfortable with it. Scientists often deplore the
notion of condensing masses of frequently conflicting, highly uncertain, often ambiguous data that have been extrapolated well beyond anything actually measured
down to a single number or two. Regulatory officials are battered by the public
when they propose a level of risk that they think a community living next to a toxic
waste site should tolerate. Critics of government spending think risks are being systematically overestimated, resulting in too much money being spent for too little real
improvement in public health. Others think risks are underestimated since risk assessments are based on data obtained for exposure to individual chemicals, ignoring
the synergistic effects that are likely to occur when we are exposed to thousands of
them in our daily lives.
Some of the aforementioned conflicts can best be dealt with if we make the distinction between risk assessment and risk management. Risk assessment is the scientific side of the story. It is the gathering of data that are used to relate response to
dose. Such dose-response data can then be combined with estimates of likely human
exposure to produce overall assessments of risk. Risk management, on the other
hand, is the process of deciding what to do. It is decision making, under extreme uncertainty, about how to allocate national resources to protect public health and the
environment. Enormous political and social judgment is required to make those decisions. Is a one-in-a-million lifetime risk of getting cancer acceptable and, if it is,
how do we go about trying to achieve it?

2

Perspectives on Risks
The usual starting point for an explanation of risk is to point out that there is some
risk in everything we do, and since we will all die someday, our lifetime risk of death
from all causes is 1.0, or 100 percent. It is easy to gather good data on the causes of
death, such as are shown in Table 1, which gives us one approach to talking about
risk. For example, of the total 2.393 million predicted deaths in the United States in
2006, 564,800 were predicted to be caused by cancer. Neglecting age structure complications, we could say that, on the average, the risk, or probability, of someone in
the United States dying of cancer is about 24 percent (564,800>2,393,000 = 0.24).

Notice that there are no units associated with risk, although other clarifiers
may be needed, such as whether the risk is a lifetime risk or an annual risk, whether
it is an average risk to the general public or a risk faced by individuals who engage
in some activity, or whether it is being expressed as a percentage or as a decimal
fraction. For example, in the United States, smoking is thought to be causing
approximately 400,000 deaths per year. On the average, the probability of death
caused by smoking is therefore about 18 percent (400,000>2,177,000 = 0.18).
Obviously, however, the risk that an individual faces from smoking depends on how
much that person smokes and how much exposure is caused by smoke from other
people’s cigarettes. The probability that a pack-a-day smoker will die of lung cancer,
heart disease, or emphysema brought on by smoking is about 0.25, or 25 percent
(Wilson and Crouch, 1987). Statistically, smokers shorten their life expectancy by
about 5 minutes for each cigarette smoked, which is roughly the time it takes to
smoke that cigarette.
Environmental risk assessments deal with incremental probabilities of some
harm occurring. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) attempts
to control our exposure to toxics to levels that will pose incremental lifetime cancer
risks to the most exposed members of the public of roughly 10-6 (1 additional
cancer in 1 million people) to 10-4 (100 additional cancers per million people). For
perspective, suppose all 260 million Americans faced a 10-6 lifetime risk of cancer
from exposure to a particular toxic chemical. That would mean 260 extra cancers
during their lifetimes. Suppose we assume a typical lifetime of 70 years. Then
spreading those 260 cancers out over 70 years suggests roughly 4 extra cancers per
year in the United States. Table 1 tells us there are 521,000 cancer deaths per year,
so the 4 extra cancers caused by toxic exposure would be less than 0.001 percent of
the nominal rate.
Presenting risks as an annual probability of death to individuals who engage in
some activity is a much more specific way to express risks than simply looking at the

population as a whole. Table 2 shows risk data for some common activities. For example, the probability of dying in a motorcycle accident among those who ride motorcycles is 2,000 deaths per year per 100,000 motorcyclists. Another example is the
risk associated with consuming 4 tablespoons of peanut butter per day. It turns out
that mold on peanuts creates a group of chemicals called aflatoxins that are known
to cause malignant tumors in a number of animals, such as rats, mice, guinea pigs,
and monkeys. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricts the aflatoxin concentration in peanut products to 20 ppb (a risk-based decision), and at that level,
eating 4 tablespoons of peanut butter per day may cause an estimated 0.8 cancer
deaths per year per 100,000. Another interesting item on the list is associated with
the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) created when food is charbroiled.
PAHs are formed when carbon-containing materials are not completely oxidized
during combustion, so consumption of burned steak poses some cancer risk. In
Table 2 that risk is estimated at 0.5 deaths per year per 100,000 people who eat 3
ounces of broiled steak per day. Notice, for comparison, that the annual risk associated with a one-in-a-million lifetime risk is about 0.0014 per 100,000.
The data in Table 1 are based on actuarial data, so they may be considered accurate, but the data in Tables 2 and 3 are a mix of actuarial values and estimates
based on various risk models. Always keep in mind that when risks are based on
models, there are generally very large uncertainties in the estimates.
Wilson (1979) provides some perspectives on risk by comparing various activities on the basis of equal, one-in-one-million (10-6) risks. For example, aircraft
statistics indicate that 100 billion passenger miles of travel each year in the United
States result in about 100 deaths per year; that is, 1 death per billion passenger
miles. A trip of 1,000 miles would therefore result in a risk of about 10-6. As another
example, Wilson cites statistics on death rates caused by sulfur emissions from
coal plants east of the Mississippi. At 20,000 deaths per year among 100 million
people exposed to this dirty air, the average risk would be 20,000兾100,000,000, or
0.0002 per year of exposure. Two days of breathing this polluted air would pose a

risk of 2>365 * 0.0002 = 10-6. Other examples of one-in-a-million risks are given
in Table 3. As suggested there, for example, smoking 1.4 cigarettes is equivalent in
risk terms to living 50 years within 5 miles of a nuclear power plant. Again, bear
in mind that these values are at best rough approximations.
One of the purposes of risk assessment is to provide a starting point in balancing the tradeoffs between an acceptable incremental risk and the cost of controlling
risk to that level. Table 4 shows some estimated expenditures to prevent a life from
being shortened by one year. Immunizations and phasing out leaded gasoline are
indicated to have no cost to them because the direct savings in health care far exceed
their cost. Pollution control in the case of lead emissions is very cost-effective, but
the table suggests that saving lives by controlling dioxin at a paper mill is very costly
indeed.

Data such as those given in the preceding tables are often used to try to put the
health risk associated with pollution into perspective. It usually turns out, however,
that the perceptions of risk as seen by an engineer or scientist familiar with the numbers are very different from those of an individual who lives next to a toxic waste
site. Social scientists have studied this phenomenon and conclude that there are a
number of attributes of risk that can increase the anxiety level of someone evaluating his or her own personal exposures.
For example, people are more likely to be outraged when they have no control
of the risks they are exposed to, and they are more fearful of unknown risks than
ones they are familiar with. We quite readily take on the risk of crashing into a tree
when skiing because it is a voluntary activity, and we are familiar with and understand the risks. We put ourselves at great risk by driving cars, but we feel somewhat
in control and believe the risk is worth the benefits. We also accept natural risks
such as earthquakes and hurricanes much more readily than unnatural ones, such as
the 1984 accidental release of methyl isocyanate from a storage tank in Bhopal,
India, which killed 3,400 people. We are also probably more comfortable living next
to a gas station, despite the exposure to the carcinogen benzene, than living anywhere near a nuclear power plant, with its perceived unknown and uncertain risks.
Table 5 illustrates this notion by comparing attributes that seem to be associated
with elevated perceptions of risk.
That these risk attributes can be so important to the public can be a source of
frustration in the technical community, but they are real and must be acknowledged
by anyone who needs to communicate risk concepts to the public. Finding a way
to help people act on the real risks in life and worry less about the minor ones is a
difficult challenge.

Risk Assessment

Risk Assessment
Our concern is with the probability that exposure of some number of people to
some combination of chemicals will cause some amount of response, such as cancer,
reproductive failure, neurological damage, developmental problems, or birth defects. That is, we want to begin to develop the notions of risk assessment. The
National Academy of Sciences (1983) suggests that risk assessment be divided into
the following four steps: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure
assessment, and risk characterization. After a risk assessment has been completed,
the important stage of risk management follows, as shown in Figure 1. The four
steps of risk assessment are described here:
• Hazard identification is the process of determining whether or not a particular
chemical is causally linked to particular health effects, such as cancer or birth
defects. Because human data are so often difficult to obtain, this step usually
focuses on whether a chemical is toxic in animals or other test organisms.
• Dose-response assessment is the process of characterizing the relationship between the dose of an agent administered or received and the incidence of an
adverse health effect. Many different dose-response relationships are possible
for any given agent depending on such conditions as whether the response is
carcinogenic (cancer causing) or noncarcinogenic and whether the experiment
is a one-time acute test or a long-term chronic test. Because most tests are performed with high doses, the dose-response assessment must include a consideration for the proper method of extrapolating data to low exposure rates that
humans are likely to experience. Part of the assessment must also include a
method of extrapolating animal data to humans.

Risk Assessment

• Exposure assessment involves determining the size and nature of the population that has been exposed to the toxicant under consideration and the length
of time and toxicant concentration to which they have been exposed. Consideration must be given to such factors as the age and health of the exposed population, smoking history, the likelihood that members of the population might
be pregnant, and whether or not synergistic effects might occur due to exposure to multiple toxicants.
• Risk characterization is the integration of the foregoing three steps, which
results in an estimate of the magnitude of the public-health problem.

5

Hazard Identification
The first step in a risk analysis is to determine whether or not the chemicals that a
population has been exposed to are likely to have any adverse health effects. This
is the work of toxicologists who study both the nature of the adverse effects caused
by toxic agents as well as the probability of their occurrence. We start our description of this hazard identification process by summarizing the pathways that a
chemical may take as it passes through a human body and the kinds of damage
that may result. A simple diagram of the human circulatory system is shown in
Figure 2, which identifies some of the principal organs and the nomenclature for
toxic effects.
A toxicant can enter the body using any of three pathways: by ingestion
with food or drink, through inhalation, or by contact with the skin (dermal) or
other exterior surfaces, such as the eyes. Once in the body, it can be absorbed by
the blood and distributed to various organs and systems. The toxicant may then
be stored (for example, in fat, as in the case of DDT), or it may be eliminated
from the body by excretion or by transformation into something else. The biotransformation process usually yields metabolites that can be more readily eliminated from the body than the original chemicals; however, metabolism can also
convert chemicals to more toxic forms. Figure 3 presents the most important
movements of chemical toxicants in the body, showing absorption, distribution,
storage, and excretion. Although these are shown as separate operations, they all
occur simultaneously.
Several organs are especially vulnerable to toxicants. The liver, for example,
which filters the blood before it is pumped through the lungs, is often the target.
Since toxics are transported by the bloodstream, and the liver is exposed to so much
of the blood supply, it can be directly damaged by toxics. Moreover, since a major
function of the liver is to metabolize substances, converting them into forms that
can be excreted more easily from the body, it is also susceptible to chemical attack
by toxic chemicals formed during the biotransformation process itself. Chemicals
that can cause liver damage are called hepatotoxins. Examples of hepatotoxic agents
include a number of synthetic organic compounds, such as carbon tetrachloride
(CCl4), chloroform (CHCl3), and trichloroethylene (C2HCl3); pesticides, such as
DDT and paraquat; heavy metals, such as arsenic, iron, and manganese; and drugs,
such as acetaminophen and anabolic steroids. The kidneys also filter the blood, and
they too are frequently susceptible to damage.

Toxic chemicals often injure other organs and organ systems as well. The function of the kidneys is to filter blood to remove wastes that will be excreted in the
form of urine. Toxicants that damage the kidneys, called nephrotoxics, include
metals such as cadmium, mercury, and lead, as well as a number of chlorinated
hydrocarbons. Excessive kidney damage can decrease or stop the flow of urine,
causing death by poisoning from the body’s own waste products. Hematotoxicity is
the term used to describe the toxic effects of substances on the blood. Some hematotoxins, such as carbon monoxide in polluted air and nitrates in groundwater, affect
the ability of blood to transport oxygen to the tissues. Other toxicants, such as benzene, affect the formation of platelets, which are necessary for blood clotting. The
lungs and skin, due to their proximity to pollutants, are also often affected by chemical toxicants. Lung function can be impaired by such substances as cigarette smoke,
ozone, asbestos, and quartz rock dust. The skin reacts in a variety of ways to chemical toxicants, but the most common and serious environmentally related skin problem is cancer induced by excessive ultraviolet radiation.

Acute Toxicity
This chapter began with a quote by Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus
von Hohenheim-Paracelsus to the effect that it is the dose that makes the poison.
One measure of the toxicity of something is the amount needed to cause some acute
response, such as organ injury, coma, or even death. Acute toxicity refers to effects
that are caused within a short period of time after a single exposure to the chemical;

136

Risk Assessment

later we will discuss chronic toxicity effects that take place after prolonged exposure
periods.
One way to describe the toxicity of chemicals is by the amount that is required
to kill the organism. Table 6 shows a conventional toxicity rating scheme that expresses the dose in terms of milligrams of chemical ingested per kilogram of body
weight. That is, ingestion of a given amount of toxin will be more dangerous for a
small person, such as a child, than a larger adult. Normalizing the dose using body
weight is the first step in trying to relate a lethal dose to a laboratory animal to what
might be expected in a human. For example, it takes on the order of 20,000 mg of
ordinary sucrose per kilogram to kill a rat. Using the rating system in Table 6,
sucrose would be considered practically nontoxic. If we scale up that dose to a
70-kg human (without any other adjustments), it might take something like 1.4 kg
of sucrose (3 pounds) ingested all at one time to be lethal. At the other extreme, the
bacteria Clostridium botulinum, responsible for botulism (food poisoning), is lethal
with a single dose of only 0.00001 mg/kg, so it is supertoxic (Rodricks, 1992).
Not every member of an exposed population will react the same way to a
toxin, so one way to illustrate the variation is with a dose-response curve that shows
the percentage of a population that is affected as a function of the dose received. In
the dose-response curves of Figure 4, a logarithmic scale for dose is shown, which

Risk Assessment

tends to yield the familiar S-shaped curve. Also notice that the dose is expressed as
milligrams of chemical ingested per kilogram of body weight. Normalizing with body
weight allows the dose to be extrapolated to individuals of different sizes, such as a
child versus an adult. Also, it provides a first cut at extrapolating the likely effects on
a human when the dose-response curve has been generated using animal tests.
The curves of Figure 4 show the response to chemical exposure as a mortality
rate. The dose that will kill 50 percent of a population is designated LD50, where LD
stands for lethal dose. In Figure 4a, the dose-response curves for two chemicals are
shown. Chemical A has a lower LD50 than Chemical B, and it is always more toxic.
Figure 4b warns us to be aware that just because one chemical has a lower LD50
than another does not necessarily mean it is always more toxic. Chemical A has a
lower LD50, which would normally suggest it is more toxic than C, but notice it is
not as toxic as C at low doses. So the dose-response curve does provide more information than a simple table of LD50 doses.

Mutagenesis
In contrast to the short-term responses associated with acute toxicity, most risk assessments are focused on responses that may take years to develop. Measuring the
ability of specific chemicals to cause cancer, reproductive failure, and birth defects is
much more difficult than the acute toxicity testing just described.
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is an essential component of all living things
and a basic material in the chromosomes of the cell nucleus. It contains the genetic
code that determines the overall character and appearance of every organism. Each
molecule of DNA has the capability to replicate itself exactly, transmitting that
genetic information to new cells. Our interest here in DNA results from the fact
that certain chemical agents, as well as ionizing radiation, are genotoxic; that is,
they are capable of altering DNA. Such changes, or mutations, in the genetic material of an organism can cause cells to misfunction, leading in some cases to cell
death, cancer, reproductive failure, or abnormal offspring. Chemicals that are
capable of causing cancer are called carcinogens; chemicals that can cause birth
defects are teratogens.
Mutations may affect somatic cells, which are the cells that make up the tissues and organs of the body itself, or they may cause changes in germ cells (sperm or
ovum) that may be transmitted to future offspring. As is suggested in Figure 5, one
possible outcome of a mutagenic event is the death of the cell itself. If the mutation
is in a somatic cell and it survives, the change may be such that the cell no longer responds to signals that normally control cell reproduction. If that occurs, the cell may
undergo rapid and uncontrolled cellular division, forming a tumor. Mutations in
somatic cells may damage or kill the affected individual, and if the individual is a
pregnant female, the embryo may be damaged, leading to a birth defect. Germ cell
mutations, on the other hand, have the potential to become established in the gene
pool and be transmitted to future generations.

Carcinogenesis
Cancer is second only to heart disease in terms of the number of Americans killed
every year. In 2006, nearly 1.4 million new cancer cases were diagnosed in the

United States, and over one-half million people die each year from cancer. Cancer is
truly one of the most dreaded diseases.
Chemically induced carcinogenesis is thought to involve two distinct stages,
referred to as initiation and promotion. In the initiation stage, a mutation alters a
cell’s genetic material in a way that may or may not result in the uncontrolled
growth of cells that characterizes cancer. In the second, or promotion, stage of development, affected cells no longer recognize growth constraints that normally
apply, and a tumor develops. Promoters can increase the incidence rate of tumors
among cells that have already undergone initiation, or they can shorten the latency
period between initiation and the full carcinogenic response. The model of initiation
followed by promotion suggests that some carcinogens may be initiators, others
may be promoters, and some may be complete carcinogens capable of causing both
stages to occur. Current regulations do not make this distinction, however, and any
substance capable of increasing the incidence of tumors is considered a carcinogen,
subject to the same risk assessment techniques. Tumors, in turn, may be benign or
malignant depending on whether or not the tumor is contained within its own
boundaries. If a tumor undergoes metastasis—that is, it breaks apart and portions of
it enter other areas of the body—it is said to be malignant. After a tumor has metastasized, it is obviously much harder to treat or remove.
The theoretical possibility that a single genotoxic event can lead to a tumor is
referred to as the one-hit hypothesis. Based on this hypothesis, exposure to even the
smallest amount of a carcinogen leads to some nonzero probability that a malignancy
will result. That is, in a conservative, worst-case risk assessment for carcinogens, it is
assumed that there is no threshold dose below which the risk is zero.
A brief glossary of carcinogenesis terminology is presented in Table 7.

Toxicity Testing in Animals
With several thousand new chemicals coming onto the market each year, a backlog
of tens of thousands of relatively untested chemicals already in commerce, and a
limited number of facilities capable of providing the complex testing that might be
desired, it is just not possible to test each and every chemical for its toxicity. As a result, a hierarchy of testing procedures has been developed that can be used to help
select those chemicals that are most likely to pose serious risks.
The starting point is the relatively straightforward acute toxicity testing already described. The next step may be to compare the structure of the chemical in
question with other chemicals that are known or suspected to be human carcinogens, such as those shown in Figure 6. New chemicals that are similar to these, and
other suspected carcinogens, would be potential candidates for further testing.
The prevailing carcinogenesis theory, that human cancers are initiated by gene
mutations, has led to the development of short-term, in vitro (in glassware) screening
procedures, which are one of the first steps taken to determine whether a chemical is

Risk Assessment

carcinogenic. It is thought that if a chemical can be shown to be mutagenic, then it
may be carcinogenic, and further testing may be called for. The most widely used
short-term test, called the Ames mutagenicity assay, subjects special tester strains of
bacteria to the chemical in question. These tester strains have previously been rendered incapable of normal bacterial division, so unless they mutate back to a form
that is capable of division, they will die. Bacteria that survive and form colonies do
so through mutation; therefore, the greater the survival rate of these special bacteria,
the more mutagenic is the chemical.
Intermediate testing procedures involve relatively short-term (several months
duration) carcinogenesis bioassays in which specific organs in mice and rats are subjected to known mutagens to determine whether tumors develop.
Finally, the most costly, complex, and long-lasting test, called a chronic carcinogenesis bioassay, involves hundreds or thousands of animals over a time period
of several years. To assure comparable test results and verifiable data, the National
Toxicology Program in the United States has established minimum test requirements
for an acceptable chronic bioassay, which include the following:
• Two species of rodents must be tested. Mice and rats, using specially inbred
strains for consistency, are most often used. They have relatively short lifetimes, and their small size makes them easier to test in large numbers.
• At least 50 males and 50 females of each species for each dose must be tested.
Many more animals are required if the test is to be sensitive enough to detect
risks of less than a few percent.
• At least two doses must be administered (plus a no-dose control). One dose is
traditionally set at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), a level that can be
administered for a major portion of an animal’s lifetime without significantly
impairing growth or shortening the lifetime. The second dose is usually onehalf or one-fourth the MTD.
Exposure begins at 6 weeks of age and ends when the animal reaches 24 months
of age. At the end of the test, all animals are killed and their remains are subjected
to detailed pathological examinations. These tests are expensive as well as time
consuming. Testing a typical new chemical costs between $500,000 and $1.5 million, takes up to 2 or 3 years, and may entail the sacrifice of thousands of animals
(Goldberg and Frazier, 1989).
Notice that, following the aforementioned protocol, the minimum number of
animals required for a bioassay is 600 (2 species * 100 animals * 3 doses), and at
that number, it is still only relatively high risks that can be detected. With this number of animals, for the test to show a statistically significant effect, the exposed animals must have at least 5 or 10 percent more tumors than the controls in order to
conclude that the extra tumors were caused by the chemical being tested. That is,
the risk associated with this chemical can be measured only down to roughly 0.05 or
0.10 unless we test a lot more animals.
A simple example may help to clarify this statistical phenomenon. Suppose we
test 100 rats at a particular dose and find one tumor. To keep it easy, let’s say the control group never gets tumors. Can the actual probability (risk) of tumors caused by
this chemical at this dose be 1 percent? Yes, definitely. If the risk is 1 percent, we
would expect to get one tumor, which is what we got. Could the actual probability be
2 percent? Well, if the actual risk is 2 percent, and if we were able to run the test over

142

Risk Assessment

and over again on sets of 100 rats each, some of those groups would have no tumors,
some would certainly have 1 tumor, and some would have more. So our actual test of
only 1 group of 100, which found 1 tumor, is not at all inconsistent with an actual
risk of 2 percent. Could the actual risk be 3 percent? Running many sets of 100 rats
through the test would likely result in at least 1 of those groups having only 1 tumor.
So it would not be out of the question to find 1 tumor in a single group of 100 rats
even if the actual risk is 3 percent. Getting back to the original test of 100 rats and
finding 1 tumor, we have just argued that the actual risk could be anything from
0 percent to, say, 2 or 3 percent, maybe even more, and still be consistent with finding just 1 tumor. We certainly cannot conclude that the risk is only 1 percent. In other
words, with 100 animals, we cannot perform a statistically significant test and be justified in concluding that the risk is anything less than a few percent. Bioassays designed to detect lower risks require many thousands of animals. In fact, the largest
experiment ever performed involved more than 24,000 mice and yet was still insufficiently sensitive to measure a risk of less than 1 percent (Environ, 1988).
The inability of a bioassay to detect small risks presents one of the greatest difficulties in applying the data so obtained to human risk assessment. Regulators try to
restrict human risks due to exposure to carcinogens to levels of about 10-6 (one in a
million), yet animal studies are only capable of detecting risks of down to 0.01 to 0.1.
It is necessary, therefore, to find some way to extrapolate the data taken for animals
exposed to high doses to humans who will be exposed to doses that are several orders
of magnitude lower.

Human Studies
Another shortcoming in the animal testing methods just described, besides the
necessity to extrapolate the data toward zero risk, is the obvious difficulty in interpreting the data for humans. How does the fact that some substance causes tumors
in mice relate to the likelihood that it will cause cancer in humans as well? Animal
testing can always be criticized in this way, but since we are not inclined to perform
the same sorts of tests directly on humans, other methods must be used to gather
evidence of human toxicity.
Sometimes human data can be obtained by studying victims of tragedies, such
as the chemical plant leak that killed and injured thousands in Bhopal, India, and the
atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. The most important source of
human risk information, however, comes from epidemiologic studies. Epidemiology
is the study of the incidence rate of diseases in real populations. By attempting to
find correlations between disease rates and various environmental factors, an epidemiologist attempts to show in a quantitative way the relationship between exposure and risk. Such data can be used to complement animal data, clinical data, and
scientific analyses of the characteristics of the substances in question.
Epidemiologists have a number of strategies for gathering useful information,
but they share the common feature of trying to identify two populations of people
having different exposures to the risk factor being studied. Preliminary data analysis usually involves setting up a simple 2 * 2 matrix such as the one shown in
Figure 7. The rows divide the populations according to those who have, and those
who have not, been exposed to the risk factor. The columns are based on the numbers
of individuals who have acquired the disease being studied and those who have not.

FIGURE 7 A 2 * 2 matrix for an epidemiologic rate comparison. Rows divide people

Various measures can be applied to the data given in Figure 7 to see whether
they suggest an association between exposure and disease.
• The relative risk is defined as
Relative risk =

a>(a + b)
c>(c + d)

(1)

Notice that the numerator is the fraction of those exposed who have the disease, and the denominator is the fraction of those not exposed who have
the disease. If those two ratios are the same, the odds of having the disease
would not depend on whether an individual had been exposed to the risk factor, and the relative risk would be 1.0. Above 1.0, the higher the relative risk,
and the more the data suggests an association between exposure and risk.
• The attributable risk is defined as
Attributable risk =

c
a
c + d
a + b

(2)

The attributable risk is the difference between the odds of having the disease
with exposure and the odds of having the disease without exposure. An attributable risk of 0.0 suggests no relationship between exposure and risk.
• The odds ratio is defined as the cross product of the entries in the matrix:
Odds ratio =

ad
bc

(3)

The odds ratio is similar to the relative risk. Numbers above 1.0 suggest a
relationship between exposure and risk.

EXAMPLE 1 Epidemiologic Data Analysis
An evaluation of personnel records for employees of a plant that manufactures
vinyl chloride finds that out of 200 workers, 15 developed liver cancer. A control
group consisting of individuals with smoking histories similar to the exposed
workers, and who were unlikely to have encountered vinyl chloride, had 24 with
liver cancers and 450 who did not develop liver cancer. Find the relative risk,
attributable risk, and odds ratio for these data.

The relative risk and the odds ratio both are above 1.0, so they suggest a relationship between exposure and risk. For those who were exposed, the risk of cancer has increased by 0.024 (the attributable risk) over that of their cohorts who
were not exposed. All three measures indicate that further study of the relationship between vinyl chloride and liver cancer would be warranted.
Caution must be exercised in interpreting every epidemiologic study since any
number of confounding variables may lead to invalid conclusions. For example, the
study may be biased because workers are compared with nonworkers (workers are
generally healthier), or because relative rates of smoking have not been accounted
for, or there may be other variables that are not even hypothesized in the study that
may be the actual causal agent. As an example of the latter, consider an attempt to
compare lung cancer rates in a city having high ambient air pollution levels
with rates in a city having less pollution. Suppose the rates are higher in the more
polluted city, even after accounting for smoking history, age distribution, and working background. To conclude that ambient air pollution is causing those differences
may be totally invalid. Instead, it might well be different levels of radon in homes, or
differences in other indoor air pollutants associated with the type of fuel used for
cooking and heating, that are causing the cancer variations.

Based on the accumulated evidence from clinical studies, epidemiologic evidence, in
vitro studies, and animal data, the EPA uses the following categories to describe
the likelihood that a chemical substance is carcinogenic (U.S. EPA, 1986a). Using
both human and animal data, five categories, A through E, have been established as
follows:
Group A: Human carcinogen. A substance is put into this category only when
sufficient epidemiologic evidence supports a causal association between
exposure to the agent and cancer.

Group B: Probable human carcinogen. This group is actually made up of two
subgroups. An agent is categorized as B1 if there is limited epidemiologic
evidence; and an agent is put into B2 if there is inadequate human data but
sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals.
Group C: Possible human carcinogen. This group is used for agents with limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animals and an absence of human data.
Group D: Not classified. This group is for agents with inadequate human and
animal evidence or for which no data are available.
Group E: Evidence of noncarcinogenicity. This group is used for agents that
show no evidence for carcinogenicity in at least two adequate animal tests
in different species or in both adequate epidemiologic and animal studies.
Table 8 summarizes this categorization scheme.

Dose-Response Assessment
As the name suggests, the fundamental goal of a dose-response assessment is to obtain a mathematical relationship between the amount of a toxicant that a human is
exposed to and the risk that there will be an unhealthy response to that dose. We
have seen dose-response curves for acute toxicity, in which the dose is measured in
milligrams per kilogram of body weight. The dose-response curves that we are interested in here are the result of chronic toxicity; that is, the organism is subjected to
a prolonged exposure over a considerable fraction of its life. For these curves, the
abscissa is dose, which is usually expressed as the average milligrams of substance
per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg-day). The dose is an exposure averaged
over an entire lifetime (for humans, assumed to be 70 years). The ordinate is the
response, which is the risk that there will be some adverse health effect. As usual,
response (risk) has no units; it is a probability that there will be some adverse health
effect. For example, if prolonged exposure to some chemical would be expected to
produce 700 cancers in a population of 1 million, the response could be expressed
as 0.0007, 7 * 10-4, or 0.07 percent. The annual risk would be obtained by spreading that risk over an assumed 70-year lifetime, giving a risk of 0.00001 or 1 * 10-5
per year.
For substances that induce a carcinogenic response, it is always conventional
practice to assume that exposure to any amount of the carcinogen will create some

likelihood of cancer. That is, a plot of response versus dose is required to go through
the origin. For noncarcinogenic responses, it is usually assumed that there is some
threshold dose, below which there will be no response. As a result of these two
assumptions, the dose-response curves and the methods used to apply them are quite
different for carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic effects, as suggested in Figure 8. The
same chemical, by the way, may be capable of causing both kinds of response.
To apply dose-response data obtained from animal bioassays to humans, a
scaling factor must be introduced. Sometimes the scaling factor is based on the assumption that doses are equivalent if the dose per unit of body weight in the animal
and human is the same. Sometimes, especially if the exposure is dermal, equivalent
doses are normalized to body surface area rather than body weight when scaling up
from animal to human. In either case, the resulting human dose-response curve is
specified with the standard mg/kg-day units for dose. Adjustments between animal
response and human response may also have to be made to account for differences
in the rates of chemical absorption. If enough is known about the differences
between the absorption rates in test animals and in humans for the particular substance in question, it is possible to account for those differences later in the risk assessment. Usually, however, there is insufficient data, and it is simply assumed that
the absorption rates are the same.

Extrapolations from High Doses to Low Doses
The most controversial aspect of dose-response curves for carcinogens is the method
chosen to extrapolate from the high doses actually administered to test animals to
the low doses to which humans are likely to be exposed. Recall that even with
extremely large numbers of animals in a bioassay, the lowest risks that can be measured are usually a few percent. Since regulators attempt to control human risk to
several orders of magnitude less than that, there will be no actual animal data anywhere near the range of most interest.
Many mathematical models have been proposed for the extrapolation to low
doses. Unfortunately, no model can be proved or disproved from the data, so there
is no way to know which model is the most accurate. That means the choice of
models is strictly a policy decision. One commonly used model is called the one-hit

147

Risk Assessment

model, in which the relationship between dose (d) and lifetime risk (probability) of
cancer, P(d), is given in the following form (Crump, 1984):
P(d) = 1 - e-(q0 + q1d)

(4)

where q0 and q1 are parameters picked to fit the data. The one-hit model corresponds to the simplest mechanistic model of carcinogenesis, in which it is assumed
that a single chemical hit is capable of inducing a tumor.
If we substitute d = 0 into (1), the result will be an expression for the background rate of cancer incidence, P(0). Using the mathematical expansion for an
exponential
ex = 1 + x +

x2
xn
+ Á +
⬵ 1 + x
2!

(for small x)

(5)

and assuming that the background cancer rate is small allows us to write
P(0) = 1 - e-q0 ⬵ 1 - [1 + (- q0)] = q0

(6)

That is, the background rate for cancer incidence corresponds to the parameter q0.
Using the exponential expansion again, the one-hit model suggests that the lifetime
probability of cancer for small dose rates can be expressed as
P(d) ⬵ 1 - [1 - (q0 + q1d)] = q0 + q1d = P(0) + q1d

(7)

For low doses, the additional risk of cancer above the background rate is
Additional risk = A(d) = P(d) - P(0)

(8)

Substituting (7) into (8) yields the following equation for the additional cancer risk
incurred when the organism in question is exposed to a dose d:
Additional risk = A(d) ⬵ q1d

(9)

That is, the one-hit model predicts that for low doses, the extra lifetime probability
of cancer is linearly related to dose.
The one-hit model relating risk to dose is not the only one possible. Another
mathematical model that has been proposed has its roots in the multistage model of
tumor formation; that is, that tumors are the result of a sequence of biological
events (Crump, 1984). The multistage model expresses the relationship between risk
and dose as
2

P(d) = 1 - e-(q0 + q1d + q2d

+ Á qndn)

(10)

where the individual parameters qi are positive constants picked to best fit the doseresponse data. Again, it is easy to show that for small values of dose d, the multistage model also has the simplifying feature of producing a linear relationship
between additional risk and dose. Figure 9 illustrates the use of a one-hit model and
a multistage model to fit experimental data. The multistage model will always fit the
data better since it includes the one-hit model as a special case.
Since the choice of an appropriate low-dose model is not based on experimental data, no model can be proved to be more correct than another. To protect public
health, EPA chooses to err on the side of safety and overemphasize risk. The EPA’s
model of choice is a modified multistage model, called the linearized multistage
model. It is linear at low doses with the constant of proportionality picked in a way
that the probability of overestimating the risk is 95 percent.

Potency Factor for Carcinogens
For chronic toxicity studies, a low dose is administered over a significant portion of
the animal’s lifetime. The resulting dose-response curve has the incremental risk of
cancer (above the background rate) on the y-axis, and the lifetime average daily
dose of toxicant along the x-axis. At low doses, where the dose-response curve is assumed to be linear, the slope of the dose-response curve is called the potency factor
(PF), or slope factor.
Potency factor =

Incremental lifetime cancer risk
Chronic daily intake (mg/kg-day)

(11)

The denominator in (11) is the dose averaged over an entire lifetime; it has units of
average milligrams of toxicant absorbed per kilogram of body weight per day,
which is usually written as (mg/kg-day) or (mg/kg/day). Since risk has no units, the
units for potency factor are therefore (mg/kg-day)-1.
If we have a dose-response curve, we can find the potency factor from the
slope. In fact, one interpretation of the potency factor is that it is the risk produced
by a chronic daily intake of 1 mg/kg-day, as shown in Figure 10.
Rearranging (11) shows us where we are headed. If we know the chronic daily
intake CDI (based on exposure data) and the PF (from EPA), we can find the lifetime, incremental cancer risk from
Incremental lifetime cancer risk = CDI * PF

(12)

The linearized multistage risk-response model assumptions built into (12) should
make this value an upper-bound estimate of the actual risk. Moreover, (12) estimates the risk of getting cancer, which is not necessarily the same as the risk of dying
of cancer, so it should be even more conservative as an upper-bound estimate of
cancer death rates.
Potency factors needed for (12) can be found in an EPA database on toxic
substances called the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). Included in the

rather extensive background information on each potential carcinogen in IRIS is the
potency factor and the weight-of-evidence category (recall Table 8). A short list of
some of these chemicals, PFs (for both oral and inhalation exposure routes), and
cancer categories is given in Table 9.
The other factor we need to develop more fully in order to use the basic risk
equation (12) is the concept of chronic daily intake. The CDI is, by definition,
CDI (mg/kg-day) =

150

Average daily dose (mg/day)
Body weight (kg)

(13)

Risk Assessment

The numerator in (13) is the total lifetime dose averaged over an assumed 70-year
lifetime. The next example shows how to combine CDI and potency to find risk.
EXAMPLE 2 Risk Assessment for Chloroform in Drinking Water
When drinking water is disinfected with chlorine, an undesired byproduct, chloroform (CHCl3), may be formed. Suppose a 70-kg person drinks 2 L of water
every day for 70 years with a chloroform concentration of 0.10 mg/L (the drinking water standard).
a. Find the upper-bound cancer risk for this individual.
b. If a city with 500,000 people in it also drinks the same amount of this water,
how many extra cancers per year would be expected? Assume the standard
70-year lifetime.
c. Compare the extra cancers per year caused by chloroform in the drinking
water with the expected number of cancer deaths from all causes. The
cancer death rate in the United States is 189 per 100,000 per year.
Solution
a. From Table 9, we see that chloroform is a Class B2 probable human carcinogen with a potency factor of 6.1 * 10-3 (mg/kg-day)-1. Using (13), the
chronic daily intake is
CDI (mg/kg-day) =

Average daily dose (mg/day)
Body weight (kg)

0.10 mg/L * 2 L/day
= 0.00286 mg/kg-day
70 kg
From (12), the incremental lifetime cancer risk is
=

Risk = CDI * PF
= 0.00286 (mg/kg-day) * 6.1 * 10-3 (mg/kg-day)-1 = 17.4 * 10-6
So, over a 70-year period, the upper-bound estimate of the probability that
a person will get cancer from this drinking water is about 17 in 1 million.
b. If there are 17.4 cancers per million people over a 70-year period, then in
any given year in a population of 500,000, the number of cancers caused by
chloroform would be
500,000 people *

17.4 cancer
1
= 0.12 cancers/yr
*
6
70 yr
10 people

c. The total number of cancer deaths that would be expected in a city of
500,000 would be
500,000 people *

189 cancer/yr
= 945 cancer deaths/yr
100,000 people

It would seem that an additional 0.12 new cancers per year would not be
detectable.

151

Risk Assessment

Once again, it is necessary to emphasize that the science behind a risk assessment calculation of the sort demonstrated in Example 2 is primitive, and enormous
uncertainties are associated with any particular answer so computed. There is still
great value, however, to this sort of procedure since it does organize a mass of data
into a format that can be communicated to a much wider audience, and it can greatly help that audience find legitimate perspectives based on that data. For example, it
matters little whether the annual extra cancers associated with chloroform in the
preceding example are found to be 0.12 or even ten times as much, 1.2; the conclusion that the extra cancers would be undetectable would not change.
Another use for these risk calculations is to estimate the concentration of a
contaminant in drinking water that would result in a politically acceptable risk level.
Often that risk goal is 10-6, and the concentration that will produce that risk is
called the drinking water equivalent level (DWEL). To find the DWEL, it is usually
assumed that a 70-kg adult consumes 2 L of water per day. As Example 3 shows, we
can find the DWEL from the potency factor using (12).

EXAMPLE 3 Drinking Water Concentration of Chloroform for a 10-6 Risk
Find the concentration of chloroform in drinking water that would result in a 10-6
risk for a 70-kg person who drinks 2 L/day throughout his or her entire lifetime.
Solution
CDI =

Rearranging (4.12) and using the PF from Table 9 gives

Risk
10-6
=
= 1.64 * 10-4 (mg/kg-day)
Potency factor
6.1 * 10-3 (kg-day/mg)

Since CDI is just the average daily intake divided by body mass, we can write
CDI =

C(mg/L) * 2 L/day
= 1.64 * 10-4 (mg/kg-day)
70 kg

where C(mg/L) is the allowable concentration of chloroform. Solving for C gives
C = 70 * 1.64 * 10-4 >2 = 0.0057 ⬵ 6 * 10-3 mg/L = 6 mg/L
So a DWEL of 6 mg/L for chloroform would result in an upper-bound risk of 10-6.

In Examples 2 and 3 it was assumed that everyone drinks 2 L of contaminated
water every day for 70 years. When a risk assessment is made for exposures that do
not last the entire lifetime, we need to develop the chronic daily intake a little more
carefully.
If the contaminant is in drinking water, the CDI can be expressed as
CDI =

Concentration (mg/L) * Intake rate (L/day) * Exposure (days/life)
Body weight (kg) * 70 (yr/life) * 365 (days/yr)

(14)

where Concentration refers to the contaminant concentration, Intake rate is the
amount of water ingested each day, and Exposure is the number of days in a lifetime
that the person drinks contaminated water.

152

Risk Assessment

If the exposure route is inhalation of a contaminant, the chronic daily intake
can be expressed as
CDI =

Concentration (mg/m3) * Intake rate (m3/day) * Exposure (days/life)
Body weight (kg) * 70 (yr/life) * 365 (days/yr)

(15)

where Concentration is the contaminant concentration in air, and the Intake rate is
the amount of air inhaled during each day that the person is exposed to the contamination. Similar expressions can be used for consumption of contaminated food or
soil and for dermal contact with contaminated soil.
EXAMPLE 4 An Occupational Exposure
Estimate the incremental cancer risk for a 60-kg worker exposed to a particular
carcinogen under the following circumstances. Exposure time is 5 days per week,
50 weeks per year, over a 25-year period of time. The worker is assumed to breathe
20 m3 of air per day. The carcinogen has a potency factor of 0.02 (mg/kg-day)-1,
and its average concentration is 0.05 mg/m3.
Solution

Since this is an inhalation exposure, we will use (15).

CDI =

0.05 mg/m3 * 20 m3/day * 5 days/wk * 50 wk/yr * 25 yr
60 kg * 70 yr/life * 365 days/yr

= 0.0041 mg/kg-day
Using (12), the upper-bound, incremental cancer risk is CDI * potency:
Incremental risk = 0.0041 mg/kg-day * 0.02 (mg/kg-day)-1 = 81 * 10-6
which is considerably higher than the usual goal of 10-6 risk.
The EPA has developed a set of recommended default values for daily intakes,
exposures, and body weights to be used in risk calculations when more site-specific
information is not available. Table 10 shows some of these default factors, and the
next example illustrates their use.
EXAMPLE 5 A Proposed Source of Benzene in Your Neighborhood
Suppose an industrial facility that emits benzene into the atmosphere is being
proposed for a site near a residential neighborhood. Air quality models predict
that 60 percent of the time, prevailing winds will blow the benzene away from the
neighborhood, but 40 percent of the time the benzene concentration will be
0.01 mg/m3. Use standard exposure factors from Table 10 to assess the incremental risk to adults in the neighborhood if the facility is allowed to be built. If
the acceptable risk is 10-6, should this plant be allowed to be built?
Solution

Using factors from Table 10, the chronic daily intake will be

CDI =

0.01 mg/m3 * 20 m3/day * 350 day/yr * 30 yr
* 0.40
70 kg * 365 day/yr * 70 yr

= 0.00047 mg/kg-day

153

Risk Assessment

The potency factor from Table 9 for benzene is 2.9 * 10-2 (mg/kg-day)-1, so the
incremental risk would be
Incremental risk = 0.00047 mg/kg-day * 2.9 * 10-2 (mg/kg-day)-1
= 1.3 * 10-5
The risk is higher than the acceptable level, so the facility should not be built as it
is being proposed.

The Reference Dose for Noncarcinogenic Effects
The key assumption for noncarcinogens is that there is an exposure threshold; that
is, any exposure less than the threshold would be expected to show no increase in
adverse effects above natural background rates. One of the principal goals of toxicant testing is therefore to identify and quantify such thresholds. Unfortunately, for
the usual case, inadequate data are available to establish such thresholds with any
degree of certainty and, as a result, it has been necessary to introduce a number of
special assumptions and definitions.
Suppose a precise threshold exists for some particular toxicant for some particular animal species. To determine the threshold experimentally, we might imagine
a testing program in which animals would be exposed to a range of doses. Doses
below the threshold would elicit no response; doses above the threshold would produce responses. The lowest dose administered that results in a response is given a
special name: the lowest-observed-effect level (LOEL). Conversely, the highest dose

administered that does not create a response is called the no-observed-effect level
(NOEL). NOELs and LOELs are often further refined by noting a distinction between effects that are adverse to health and effects that are not. Thus, there are also
no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) and lowest-observed-adverse-effect
levels (LOAELs).
Figure 11 illustrates these levels and introduces another exposure called the
reference dose, or RfD. The RfD used to be called the acceptable daily intake (ADI),
and as that name implies, it is intended to give an indication of a level of human exposure that is likely to be without appreciable risk. The units of RfD are mg/kg-day
averaged over a lifetime, just as they were for the chronic daily intake CDI. The RfD
is obtained by dividing the NOAEL by an appropriate uncertainty factor (sometimes
called a safety factor). A 10-fold uncertainty factor is used to account for differences
in sensitivity between the most sensitive individuals in an exposed human population, such as pregnant women, babies, and the elderly, and “normal, healthy” people. Another factor of 10 is introduced when the NOAEL is based on animal data
that is to be extrapolated to humans. Finally, another factor of 10 is sometimes applied when there are no good human data, and the animal data available are limited.
Thus, depending on the strength of the available data, human RfD levels are established at doses that are anywhere from one-tenth to one-thousandth of the NOAEL,
which is itself somewhat below the actual threshold. Table 11 gives a short list of
some commonly encountered toxicants and their RfDs.

The Hazard Index for Noncarcinogenic Effects
Since the reference dose RfD is established at what is intended to be a safe level, well
below the level at which any adverse health effects have been observed, it makes
sense to compare the actual exposure to the RfD to see whether the actual dose is
supposedly safe. The hazard quotient is based on that concept:
Hazard quotient =

Average daily dose during exposure period (mg/kg-day)

Notice that the daily dose is averaged only over the period of exposure, which is different from the average daily dose used in risk calculations for carcinogens. For noncarcinogens, the toxicity is important only during the time of exposure. Recall that
for a cancer risk calculation (e.g., Eq. 13), the dose is averaged over an assumed 70year lifetime.
The hazard quotient has been defined so that if it is less than 1.0, there should
be no significant risk of systemic toxicity. Ratios above 1.0 could represent a potential risk, but there is no way to establish that risk with any certainty.
When exposure involves more than one chemical, the sum of the individual
hazard quotients for each chemical is used as a measure of the potential for harm.
This sum is called the hazard index:
Hazard index = Sum of the hazard quotients

(17)

EXAMPLE 6 Hazard Index
Suppose drinking water contains 1.0 mg/L of toluene and 0.01 mg/L of tetrachloroethylene (C2Cl4). A 70-kg adult drinks 2 L per day of this water for 10 years.
a. Does the hazard index suggest that this was a safe level of exposure?
b. Tetrachloroethylene is a B2 carcinogen. What is the carcinogenic risk faced
by someone drinking this water? Is it less than a goal of 10-6?
Solution
a. First we need to find the average daily doses (ADDs) for each of the chemicals and then their individual hazard quotients.

For toluene, the RfD is given in Table 11 as 0.200 mg/kg-day, so

Hazard index = 0.14 + 0.029 = 0.17 6 1.0
The hazard index suggests that this water is safe. By the way, notice that we
did not need to know that the person drank this water for 10 years.
b. The incremental carcinogenic risk associated with the C2Cl4 is
Risk = CDI * PF
CDI =

0.01 mg/L * 2 L/day * 365 days/yr * 10 yrs
70 kg * 365 days/yr * 70 yrs

= 4.0 * 10-5 mg/kg-day
From Table 9, the oral potency is 5.1 * 10-2 (mg/kg-day)-1, so the risk is
Risk = CDI * PF
= 4.0 * 10-5 mg/kg-day * 5.1 * 10-2 (mg/kg-day)-1 = 2 * 10-6
So, from a cancer risk standpoint, this water does not meet the 10-6 risk
goal. Notice how the tetrachloroethylene was way below the RfD but was
above the desired risk goal. This is not uncommon when the hazard index
is computed for carcinogens.

Human Exposure Assessment
One of the most elementary concepts of risk assessment is all too often overlooked
in public discussions: that risk has two components—the toxicity of the substance
involved, and the amount of exposure to that substance. Unless individuals are
exposed to the toxicants, there is no human risk.
A human exposure assessment is itself a two-part process. First, pathways that
allow toxic agents to be transported from the source to the point of contact with
people must be evaluated. Second, an estimate must be made of the amount of contact that is likely to occur between people and those contaminants. Figure 12 suggests some of the transport mechanisms that are common at a toxic waste site.

Substances that are exposed to the atmosphere may volatilize and be transported
with the prevailing winds (in which case, plume models are often used). Substances
in contact with soil may leach into groundwater and eventually be transported to
local drinking water wells. As pollutants are transported from one place to another,
they may undergo various transformations that can change their toxicity and/or
concentration. Many of these fate and transport pathways for pollutants will be
covered later in this book. A useful summary of exposure pathway models that the
EPA uses is given in the Superfund Exposure Assessment Manual (U.S. EPA, 1988).
After the exposure pathways have been analyzed, an estimate of the concentrations of toxicants in the air, water, soil, and food at a particular exposure point
can be made. With the concentrations of various toxic agents established, the second
half of an exposure assessment begins. Human contact with those contaminants
must be estimated. Necessary information includes number of people exposed,
duration of exposure, and amounts of contaminated air, water, food, and soil that
find their way into each exposed person’s body. Often, the human intake estimates
are based on a lifetime of exposure, assuming standard, recommended daily values
of amounts of air breathed, water consumed, and body weight, such as given earlier
in Table 10. In some circumstances, the exposure may be intermittent, and adjustments might need to be made for various body weights, rates of absorption, and
exposure periods, as illustrated previously in Example 4.

158

Risk Assessment

Bioconcentration
One potentially important exposure route is human consumption of contaminated
fish. It is relatively straightforward to estimate concentrations of contaminants in
water, and it also is reasonable to make estimates of consumption of fish that individuals may consume (for example, the standard intake values given in Table 10).
What is more difficult is the task of estimating the concentration of a contaminant
in fish, given only the chemical concentration in water. The bioconcentration factor
(BCF) provides the key link measuring the tendency for a substance to accumulate in
fish tissue. The equilibrium concentration of a chemical in fish can be estimated by
multiplying the chemical concentration in water by the bioconcentration factor:
Concentration in fish = (concentration in water) * (bioconcentration factor)

(18)

The units of BCF (L/kg) are picked to allow the concentration of substance in
water to be the usual mg/L, and the concentration in fish to be milligrams of substance per kilogram of fish. Some example values of BCF are given in Table 12. Note
the high bioconcentration factors for chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides, such as
chlordane, DDT, and heptachlor, and the especially high concentration factor for
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). These high bioconcentration factors played an
important role in the decision to reduce or eliminate the use of these chemicals in the
United States.

Risk Assessment

Example 7 illustrates the use of bioconcentration factors in a carcinogenic risk
assessment.

EXAMPLE 7 Bioconcentration of TCE
Using the standard exposure factors in Table 10 for a person eating locally caught
fish, estimate the lifetime cancer risk from fish taken from waters containing a
concentration of trichloroethylene (TCE) equal to 100 ppb (0.1 mg/L).
Solution In Table 12, the bioconcentration factor for TCE is given as
10.6 L/kg. From (18) the expected concentration of TCE in fish is therefore
TCE concentration = 0.1 mg/L * 10.6 L/kg = 1.06 mg TCE/kg fish
From Table 10, standard exposure factors include a 70-kg person consuming 54
g of fish, 350 days per year for 30 years. The chronic daily intake CDI is thus
CDI =

0.054 kg/day * 1.06 mg TCE/kg * 350 days/yr * 30 yrs
70 kg * 365 days/yr * 70 yrs

= 3.36 * 10-4 mg/kg-day
From Table 9, the cancer potency factor for an oral dose of TCE is
1.1 * 10-2 (mg/kg-day)-1. Using (12), the upper-bound, incremental lifetime risk
of cancer is
Risk = CDI * PF
= 3.36 * 10-4 mg/kg-day * 1.1 * 10-2 (mg/kg-day)-1 = 3.6 * 10-6
or about 4 in 1 million.

Contaminant Degradation
Many toxic chemicals of concern are nonconservative; that is, they degrade with
time. Degradation may be the result of a number of processes that remove pollutants from the medium in which they reside. There may be phase transfer as a chemical volatilizes, chemical transformation if it reacts with other substances, or
biological transformation if it is consumed by microorganisms. The persistence of a
chemical as it moves through various environmental media may be affected by some
combination of these mechanisms. A convenient way to deal with such complexity is
simply to combine the degradation processes into a single, overall half-life. The halflife of a given substance will depend on whether it appears in soil, air, surface water,
or groundwater. Some representative half-lives are given in Table 13.
If the concentration of a substance is modeled with a simple exponential decay
relationship,
C(t) = C(0)e-kt

(20)

An example of how to use half-lives is given in the following example.
EXAMPLE 8 A Leaking Underground Storage Tank Exposure Assessment
Suppose an underground storage tank has been leaking for many years, contaminating the groundwater and causing a contaminant concentration directly
beneath the site of 0.30 mg/L. The contamination is flowing at the rate of 0.5 ft
per day toward a public drinking water well 1 mile away. The half-life of the
contaminant is 10 years.
a. Estimate the steady-state pollutant concentration expected at the well.
b. If the potency factor for the contaminant is 0.02 (mg/kg-day)-1, estimate the
cancer risk if a 70-kg person drank 2 L of this water per day for 10 years.
Solution
a. The time required to travel to the well 1 mile away is
Time to well =

5,280 ft
= 10,560 days
0.5 ft/day

161

Risk Assessment

The pollutant is assumed to degrade exponentially, so the reaction rate
coefficient k can be found using (20):
k =

0.693
0.693
=
= 1.9 * 10-4/day
t1>2
10 yr * 365 days/yr

In the 10,560 days required to travel to the drinking water well, (4.19)
suggests that the initial 0.30 mg/L is reduced to
C(t) = C(0)e-kt = 0.30e-(1.9 * 10

/d * 10,560 d)

-4

= 0.040 mg/L

b. The CDI for someone drinking this water for 10 years out of a 70-year
lifetime is
CDI =

0.040 mg/L * 2 L/day * 10 yr
= 1.6 * 10-4 mg/kg-day
70 kg * 70 yr

So the lifetime cancer risk would be
Risk = CDI * PF
= 1.6 * 10-4 mg/kg-day * 0.020 (mg/kg-day)-1 = 3.2 * 10-6
This is probably an upper-bound estimate of the individual risk and is
subject to all of the uncertainties that currently characterize all risk
assessments.

8

Risk Characterization
The final step in a risk assessment is to bring the various studies together into an
overall risk characterization. In its most primitive sense, this step could be interpreted to mean simply multiplying the exposure (dose) by the potency to get individual risk, and then multiplying that by the number of people exposed to get an
estimate of overall risk to some specific population.
Although there are obvious advantages to presenting a simple, single number
for extra cancers, or some other risk measure, a proper characterization of risk
should be much more comprehensive. The final expressions of risk derived in this
step will be used by regulatory decision makers in the process of weighing health
risks against other societal costs and benefits. The public will also use these expressions to help them decide on the adequacy of proposed measures to manage the
risks. Both groups need to appreciate the extraordinary leaps of faith that, by necessity, have had to be used to determine these simple quantitative estimates. It must
always be emphasized that these estimates are preliminary, subject to change, and
extremely uncertain.
The National Academy of Sciences (1983) suggests a number of questions that
should be addressed in a final characterization of risk, including the following:
• What are the statistical uncertainties in estimating the extent of health effects?
How are these uncertainties to be computed and presented?

162

Risk Assessment

• What are the biological uncertainties? What are their origins? How will they
be estimated? What effect do they have on quantitative estimates? How will
the uncertainties be described to agency decision makers?
• Which dose-response assessments and exposure assessments should be used?
• Which population groups should be the primary targets for protection, and
which provide the most meaningful expression of the health risk?
Rodricks (page 181, 1992) offers the following example of the sort of qualifying statement that ought to accompany all risk assessments (in this case for a hypothetical contaminant difluoromuckone, DFM):
Difluoromuckone (DFM) has been found to increase the risk of cancer in
several studies involving experimental animals. Investigations involving
groups of individuals exposed in the past to relatively high levels of DFM
have not revealed that the chemical increases cancer risk in humans.
Because these human studies could not detect a small increase in risk,
and because there is a scientific basis for assuming results from animal
experiments are relevant to humans, exposure to low levels of DFM may
create an increase in risk of cancer for people. The magnitude of this risk
is unknown, but probably does not exceed one in 50,000. This figure is
the lifetime chance of developing cancer from a daily exposure to the
highest levels of DFM detected in the environment. Average levels, which
are more likely to be experienced over the course of a lifetime, suggest a
lifetime risk more like one in 200,000. These risk figures were derived
using scientific assumptions that are not recognized as plausible by all
scientists, but which are consistently used by regulatory scientists when
attempting to portray the risks of environmental chemicals. It is quite
plausible that actual risks are lower than the ones cited above; higher
risks are not likely but cannot be ruled out. Regulators typically seek to
reduce risks that exceed a range of one in 100,000 to one in 1,000,000.
Note that the lifetime cancer risk we face from all sources of these diseases is about 1 in 5 (1 in 10 for nonsmokers), so that, even if correct, the
DFM risk is a minor contributor to the overall cancer problem. Prudence
may dictate the need for some small degree of risk reduction for DFM in
the environment.

9

Comparative Risk Analysis
In 1987, the EPA released a report entitled Unfinished Business: A Comparative
Assessment of Environmental Problems (U.S. EPA, 1987), in which the concepts of
risk assessment were applied to a variety of pressing environmental problems. The
goal of the study was to attempt to use risk as a policy tool for ranking major environmental problems in order to help the agency establish broad, long-term priorities.
At the outset, it was realized that direct comparisons of different environmental problems would be next to impossible. Not only are the data usually insufficient to quantify risks, but the kinds of risk associated with some problems, such as
global warming, are virtually incomparable with risks of others, such as hazardous

163

Risk Assessment

waste. In most cases, considerable professional judgment rather than hard data was
required to finalize their rankings. In spite of difficulties such as these, the report is
noteworthy both in terms of its methodology and its conclusions.
The study was organized around a list of 31 environmental problems including
topics as diverse as conventional (criteria) air pollutants, indoor radon, stratospheric ozone depletion, global warming, active (RCRA) and inactive (Superfund)
hazardous waste sites, damage to wetlands, mining wastes, and pesticide residues on
foods. Each of these 31 problems was analyzed by 4 separate working groups from
the perspective of 4 different types of risk: cancer risks, noncancer health risks, ecological effects, and welfare effects (visibility impairment, materials damage, etc.).
The ranking of cancer risks was perhaps the most straightforward part of the
study because EPA already has established risk assessment procedures, and there are
considerable data already available from which to work. Rankings were based primarily on overall cancer risk to the entire U.S. population, although high risks to
specific groups of individuals such as farm workers were noted. Ordinal rankings
were given, but it was emphasized that these should not be interpreted as being
precise, especially when similarly ranked problems are being compared. Given all of
the uncertainties, in the cancer working group’s final judgment, two problems were
tied at the top of the list: (1) worker exposure to chemicals, which doesn’t involve a
large number of individuals but does result in high individual risks to those exposed;
and (2) indoor radon exposure, which is causing significant risk to a large number
of people. Inactive (Superfund) hazardous waste sites ranked 8th and active (RCRA)
hazardous waste sites were 13th. Interestingly, it was noted that with the exception of pesticide residues on food, the major route of exposure for carcinogens is
inhalation. Their final ranking of the top 10 carcinogenic risks is reproduced in
Table 14.
The other working groups had considerably greater difficulty ranking the 31
environmental problem areas since there are no accepted guidelines for quantitatively assessing relative risks. As noted in Unfinished Business, a perusal of the rankings of the 31 problem areas for each of the 4 types of risk (cancer, noncancer health
effects, ecological, and welfare effects) produced the following general results:
• No problems rank relatively high in all four types of risk, or relatively low in
all four.
• Problems that rank relatively high in three of the four risk types, or at least
medium in all four, include criteria air pollutants, stratospheric ozone depletion, pesticide residues on food, and other pesticide risks (runoff and air deposition of pesticides).
• Problems that rank relatively high in cancer and noncancer health risks, but
low in ecological and welfare risks include hazardous air pollutants, indoor
radon, indoor air pollution other than radon, pesticide application, exposure
to consumer products, and worker exposures to chemicals.
• Problems that rank relatively high in ecological and welfare risks, but low in
both health risks, include global warming, point and nonpoint sources of
surface water pollution, and physical alteration of aquatic habitats (including
estuaries and wetlands) and mining wastes.
• Areas related to groundwater consistently rank medium or low.

in consumer products. Cleaning fluids, pesticides,
particleboard, and asbestos-containing products
especially noted.
Estimated 2,000 cancers annually based on an

risk is based on extrapolation from 35 sites to
about 25,000 sites.
Estimated 400–1,000 annual cancers, mostly from
radon and trihalomethanes.
Approximately 100 cancers annually; small
population exposed but high individual risks.

oceans; discharges to wetlands.
Source: Based on data from U.S. EPA, 1987.

In spite of the great uncertainties involved in making their assessments, the
divergence between the EPA effort in the 1980s and relative risks is noteworthy.
As concluded in the study, areas of relatively high risk but low EPA effort include indoor radon; indoor air pollution; stratospheric ozone depletion; global warming;
nonpoint sources; discharges to estuaries, coastal waters, and oceans; other pesticide
risks; accidental releases of toxics; consumer products; and worker exposures. Areas
of high EPA effort but relatively medium or low risks include RCRA sites, Superfund
sites, underground storage tanks, and municipal nonhazardous waste sites.
The Unfinished Business report was the first major example of what has come
to be known as comparative risk analysis. Comparative risk analysis differs from
conventional risk assessment because its purpose is not to establish absolute values of

165

Risk Assessment

risk but rather to provide a process for ranking environmental problems by their
seriousness. A subsequent 1990 report, Reducing Risks, by the EPA’s Science Advisory
Board recommended that the EPA reorder its priorities on the basis of reducing
the most serious risks. The combination of these two reports has had considerable
influence on the way that the EPA perceives its role in environmental protection.
The EPA’s Office of Research and Development (U.S. EPA, 1996) has incorporated
these recommendations in setting forth its strategic principles, which include the
following:
• Focus research and development on the greatest risks to people and the
environment, taking into account their potential severity, magnitude, and
uncertainty.
• Focus research on reducing uncertainty in risk assessment and on cost-effective
approaches for preventing and managing risks.
• Balance human health and ecological research.
Based on those strategic principles, EPA has defined its six highest priority
research topics for the next few years (U.S. EPA, 1996):
• Drinking water disinfection. Some microorganisms, especially the protozoan
Cryptosporidium, are able to survive conventional disinfection processes, and
some carcinogens, such as chloroform, are created during chlorination of
drinking water. Questions to be addressed include the comparative risk between waterborne microbial disease and the disinfection byproducts formed
during drinking water disinfection.
• Particulate matter. Inhalation of particulate matter in the atmosphere poses a
high potential human health risk. The relationship between morbidity/mortality
and low ambient levels of particulate matter, and cost-effective methods to
reduce particulate matter emissions are principal areas of interest.
• Endocrine disruptors. Declines in the quality and quantity of human sperm
production and increased incidence of certain cancers that may have an
endocrine-related basis form the basis of concern for this high-priority research topic.
• Improved ecosystem risk assessment. Understanding the impacts of human
activities on ecosystems has not developed as rapidly as human health impacts.
Topics such as forest decline, toxic microorganisms in estuaries, reproductive
failure of wildlife, and the reappearance of vector-borne epidemic diseases
need to be addressed.
• Improved health risk assessment. Continued focus on reducing the uncertainty
in source-exposure-dose relationships, including the impacts of mixtures of
chemical insults, is needed.
• Pollution prevention and new technologies. Avoiding the creation of environmental problems is the most cost-effective risk-management strategy, but it is
not clear how best to integrate pollution prevention into government and
private-sector decision making.

Human exposure to radiation is often measured in rems (roentgen-equivalent man), or
millirems (mrem). The cancer risk caused by exposure to radiation is thought to be
approximately 1 fatal cancer per 8,000 person-rems of exposure (e.g., 1 cancer death if
8,000 people are exposed to 1 rem each, or 10,000 people exposed to 0.8 rems each, etc.).

air and keep your incremental risk below the normal acceptable risk set by EPA?
(b) You have the option of working part-time at the gasoline pump job. Having taken
this class, you have vowed not to accept an incremental risk greater than 10-7 from
workplace exposure to carcinogens. How many days a year could you work on the
gasoline pump job and maintain your promise, if the benzene concentration is what
you calculated in part a?
A man works in an aluminum smelter for 10 years. The drinking water in the smelter contains 0.0700 mg/L arsenic and 0.560 mg/L methylene chloride. His only exposure to these
chemicals in water is at work.
(a) What is the hazard index (HI) associated with this exposure?
(b) Does the HI indicate this is a safe level of exposure?
(c) What is the incremental lifetime cancer risk for the man due solely to the water he
drinks at work and does it seem to be an acceptable risk according to EPA?
You have just taken a job at a metal plating plant, and some of the metals you work with
contain arsenic as an impurity. The heated metals give off arsenic vapors, which create an
average concentration of arsenic of 0.00002 mg/m3 in the air in the workplace.
(a) What is your increased risk of cancer if you continue to work in this job for your
entire career?
(b) There are about 220,000 workers in the United States in metal casting plants similar
to the one in which you work. How many worker deaths above the background
cancer rate would be expected due to their occupation?
(c) Of the 220,000 workers in metal casting plants, how many would be expected to die
of cancer?
(d) Suppose your workplace air also contains mercury in the air with an average concentration of 0.0001 mg/m3. Would the HI suggest that this is a safe level of exposure?
One way to estimate maximum acceptable concentrations of toxicants in drinking water
or air is to pick an acceptable lifetime risk and calculate the concentration that would give
that risk assuming agreed-on exposures such as the residential factors given in Table 10.
Find the acceptable concentrations of the following substances:
(a) Benzene in drinking water (mg/L), at a lifetime acceptable risk of 1 * 10-5
(b) Trichloroethylene in air (mg/m3), at a lifetime acceptable risk of 1 * 10-6
(c) Benzene in air (mg/m3), at a lifetime acceptable risk of 1 * 10-5
(d) Vinyl chloride in drinking water (mg/L), at a lifetime acceptable risk of 1 * 10-4
Using exposure factors in Table 10, what would be an acceptable concentration of
trichloroethylene in the air of an industrial facility if worker risk is to be less than 10-4?
Express the answer in mg/m3 and ppm.
Suppose an individual eats fish from a river contaminated by benzene. What concentration of benzene (mg/L) in the water would produce a lifetime risk of 1 * 10-6 to an individual who eats the amount of fish suggested by the EPA exposure factors in Table 10?
Use the oral PF for benzene and the BCF given in Table 12.

Estimate the cancer risk for a 70-kg individual consuming 2 g of fish every day for 70 years
from a stream with 20 ppb of DDT.
Suppose a 50-kg individual drinks 1 L/day of water containing 2 mg/L of 1,1,1trichloroethane, 0.04 mg/L of tetrachloroethylene, and 0.1 mg/L of 1,1-dichloroethylene.
What is the hazard index? Is there cause for concern?
Suppose 1.0 g/day of heptachlor leaks into a 30,000 m3 pond. If heptachlor has a reaction
rate coefficient of 0.35/day, and complete mixing occurs,
(a) What would be the steady-state concentration in the pond?
(b) Suppose a 70-kg individual drank 2 L/day of that water for 5 years. Estimate the
maximum risk of cancer due to that exposure to heptachlor.
Mainstream smoke inhaled by a 70-kg smoker contains roughly 0.03 mg per cigarette of
the class B2 carcinogen, benzo(a)pyrene. For an individual who smokes 20 cigarettes per
day for 40 years, estimate the lifetime risk of cancer caused by that benzo(a)pyrene (there
are other carcinogens in cigarettes as well).
Consider the problem of indoor air pollution caused by sidestream smoke (unfiltered
smoke from an idling cigarette). Suppose the sidestream smoke from one cigarette in a
small apartment will produce an airborne benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) concentration that will
average 6 * 10-4 mg/m3 for 1 hour. How many cigarettes would need to be smoked in
the presence of a nonsmoking roommate to raise the nonsmoker’s cancer risk by 10-6 just
due to this BaP? Assume an inhalation rate of 0.83 m3/hr (20 m3/day). At eight cigarettes
of exposure per day, how many days would it take to create this risk?
The sidestream smoke from one cigarette releases about 0.1 mg of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP).
In an apartment with fresh air entering through holes and cracks (infiltration) at an average rate of 120 m3/hr ,
(a) What would be the steady-state indoor concentration of BaP if one cigarette per hour
is smoked? (Assume that BaP is a conservative pollutant.)
(b) What would be the incremental cancer risk to a nonsmoking roommate who spends
8 hr/day for 1 year in this apartment? (Assume an inhalation rate of 20 m3/day.)
For the following carcinogens, the U.S. drinking water standards are given. For each, find
the lifetime individual cancer risk and the incremental cancers per year in a population of
260 million as computed using a standard risk assessment based on residential exposure
factors recommended by the EPA.
(a) Trichloroethylene (TCE), 0.005 mg/L
(b) Benzene, 0.005 mg/L
(c) Arsenic, 0.01 mg/L
(d) Carbon tetrachloride, 0.005 mg/L
(e) Vinyl chloride, 0.002 mg/L
(f) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 0.0005 mg/L
One way to express cancer potency for substances that are inhaled is in terms of risk
caused by a lifetime (20 m3/day for 70 years) of breathing air with a concentration of
1.0 mg/m3 of carcinogen. The potency for formaldehyde in these terms is 1.3 * 10-5
cancer/mg/m3. What is the cancer risk caused by a lifetime of breathing formaldehyde at the
not unusual (in smoggy cities) concentration of 50 mg/m3 (the threshold of eye irritation)?

Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a common groundwater contaminant. In terms of cancer risk,
which would be better: (1) to drink unchlorinated groundwater with 10 ppb (0.010 mg/L)
of TCE; or (2) to switch to a surface water supply that, as a result of chlorination, has a
chloroform concentration of 50 ppb?
Suppose a 70-kg man is exposed to 0.1 mg/m3 of tetrachloroethylene in the air at his
workplace. If he inhales 1 m3/hr, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, 50 weeks per year, for
30 years, and if tetrachloroethylene has an absorption factor of 90 percent and an inhalation potency of 2 * 10-3 (mg/kg-day)-1, what would be his lifetime cancer risk? What
would the risk be to a 50-kg woman similarly exposed?
Suppose a factory releases a continuous flow of wastewater into a local stream, resulting
in an in-stream carcinogen concentration of 0.1 mg/L just below the outfall. Suppose this
carcinogen has an oral potency factor of 0.30 (mg/kg-day)-1 and that it is degradable with
a reaction rate coefficient k of 0.10/day. To keep the problem simple, assume that the
stream is uniform in cross section, flowing at the rate of 1 mph, and that there are no
other sources or sinks for this carcinogen. At a distance of 100 miles downstream, a town
uses this stream as its only source of water. Estimate the individual residential lifetime
cancer risk caused by drinking this water.

In the late 1960s, the Cuyahoga River in Ohio was clogged with debris and trash,
floating in layers of black, heavy oil several inches thick. When it caught fire in
1969, it became a symbol of the environmental degradation that can result from
uncontrolled industrialization. Along with images of thick mats of algae along the

shores of Lake Erie and dead fish floating on its surface, visible manifestations of
pollution quickly galvanized the public, created the modern environmental movement, and led to the enactment of some of our most important environmental legislation, including the Clean Water Act of 1972, which has jurisdiction over water
quality in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and wetlands, and the Safe Drinking Water Act of
1974, which regulates tap water quality.
In many ways, the quality of our surface waters has improved significantly as a
result of the Clean Water Act, but problems remain. The level of municipal sewage
treatment and the fraction of the population served by these facilities has risen
sharply as a result of almost $130 billion of federal, state, and local expenditures on
wastewater treatment plants. Municipal treatment plant upgrades, coupled with a
pollution discharge permit system, have dramatically reduced point-source discharges of raw sewage and industrial wastes. But diffuse, “nonpoint-source” pollution, such as runoff from agricultural lands and urban streets, has proven to be much
more difficult to regulate and control, resulting in surface water quality that still does
not meet the Clean Water Act’s goals of “fishable and swimmable” waters throughout the nation by 1983. In fact, by 2006, EPA estimated that 40 percent of the waters
in the United States did not meet the water quality standards set for them and that
over two-thirds of the population—218 million people—live within 10 miles of these
“impaired waters” (U.S. EPA, 2006).
Water pollution problems in many parts of the world are far worse. It has been
estimated that in the year 2002, 1.1 billion people lacked access to safe drinking
water, and 2.6 billion lacked access to improved sanitation (WHO, 2004). As shown
in Figure 1, growth in numbers lacking access to safe water and sanitation will be
driven in large part by the growth rate of people living in urban areas (Gleick, 1993).
Most urban centers in Africa and Asia have no sewage system at all, including many
cities with populations over 1 million people. The result is a tragic rate of morbidity
and mortality in the less developed parts of the world. In 2004, it was estimated that
88 percent of the world’s diarrheal disease (including cholera) is due to unsafe water
and sanitation (WHO, 2004). Worldwide, 1.8 million people die every year from
diarrheal disease, including over 6,000 children under the age of 5 every day (WHO/
UNICEF, 2005). In addition, recent studies have shown a clear correlation in developing countries between chronic malnutrition and a lack of safe drinking water due
to the ingestion of waterborne human parasites (Braghetta, 2006).

Water Resources
Water is so common that we take it for granted. After all, it covers nearly threefourths of the surface of the Earth. And we probably think it is much like any other
liquid, but it is not. In fact, nearly every physical and chemical property of water is
unusual when compared with other liquids, and these differences are essential to life
as we know it.

Unusual Properties of Water
Consider a simple molecule of water, H2O. As shown in Figure 2, the two hydrogen-to-oxygen chemical bonds form a 105° angle with each other, resulting in
a molecule that has a slightly positive charge at one end and a slightly negative
charge at the other. This dipolar character means water molecules are attracted to
each other, which helps explain why water boils at such a high temperature and why
it takes an unusually large amount of energy to cause it to vaporize. It also helps
explain water’s high surface tension, which allows it to support relatively heavy
objects, such as insects that skate along its surface.
The dipolar nature of water molecules causes them to adhere to other surfaces
easily, and the combination of surface tension and adhesion lets water crawl up the
sides of objects. This capillary action is crucial to life since, for example, it causes
sap to rise in trees, water to rise in soil, and food to move through organisms. The
dipolar property also makes water a very effective solvent since water molecules
tend to surround charged ions and effectively neutralize them.
Density. Water is the only common liquid that expands when it freezes. In fact, a
plot of density versus temperature shows a maximum density at 4°C, which means
that as temperatures move away from this point, water continuously becomes
lighter and more buoyant. As a result, ice floats. If it did not, ice that would form on
the surface of bodies of water would sink to the bottom, making it possible for
rivers and lakes to freeze solid from the bottom up. The expansion of water as it
freezes also contributes to the weathering of rocks by literally breaking them apart
when water freezes in the cracks. When water is warmed beyond 4°C, it becomes
buoyant once again, so warm water floats on top of cold water in lakes. This thermal stratification affects aquatic life and pollutant distribution in unusual ways, as
will be described later in this chapter.
Melting and Boiling Points. Water has unusually high boiling and freezing
temperatures for a compound having such a low molecular weight. If water were

FIGURE 2 A water molecule is dipolar; that is, it appears
to have a positive charge at one end and a negative charge
at the other. This dipolar character helps explain a number
of water’s unusual properties.

175

Water Pollution

similar to other “H2X” substances, such as H2S, H2Se, and H2Te, it would boil at
normal Earth temperatures, so it would exist mostly as a gas rather than a liquid or
solid. It also has an unusually high difference in temperature between the melting
point and boiling point, thus remaining a liquid over most of the globe. It is the only
substance that appears in all three states, gaseous, liquid, and solid (ice), within the
normal range of temperatures on Earth. With only slightly different phase change
temperatures, life on Earth would be very different, if it could exist at all.
Specific Heat. Water has a higher heat capacity (4,184 J/kg°C) than any other
known liquid except ammonia. It is five times higher than the specific heat of most
common heavy solids, such as rock and concrete. As a result, it takes water longer
to heat up and to cool down than almost anything else. This high heat capacity helps
make the oceans the major moderating factor in maintaining the temperature of the
surface of the Earth. It also serves the important function of protecting life from
rapid thermal fluctuations, which are often lethal.
Heat of Vaporization. The heat required to vaporize water (2,258 kJ/kg) is one
of the highest of all liquids. This high heat of vaporization means that water vapor
stores an unusually large amount of energy, which is released when the water vapor
condenses. This property is important in distributing heat from one place on the
globe to another and is a major factor affecting the Earth’s climate.
Water as a Solvent. Water dissolves more substances than any other common
solvent. As a result, it serves as an effective medium for both transporting dissolved
nutrients to tissues and organs in living things as well as eliminating their wastes.
Water also transports dissolved substances throughout the biosphere.
Greenhouse Effect. The 105° bond angle for water is actually an average value.
The hydrogen atoms vibrate back and forth, causing the bond angle to oscillate.
This H ¬ O ¬ H bending vibration resonates with certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation coming from the sun, allowing water vapor in the atmosphere to
absorb solar energy. Other vibrations in water molecules also cause absorption of
infrared radiation leaving the Earth’s surface. Earth’s temperature depends to a significant degree on the absorption of incoming solar and outgoing infrared radiation.
As will be described later, water vapor is in fact the most important greenhouse gas
in our atmosphere.

The Hydrologic Cycle
Almost all of the world’s water (97 percent) is located in the oceans, but as might be
expected, the high concentration of salts renders the oceans virtually unusable as a
source of water for municipal, agricultural, or most industrial needs. We do use the
oceans, however, for thermal cooling of power plants and as a sink for much of our
pollution. Although desalination technologies exist, the capital and energy requirements to produce significant quantities of fresh water are generally prohibitive,
although some small regions of the world do rely heavily on this approach.
Fortunately, the sun performs that desalination service for us when it provides the
energy needed to evaporate water, leaving the salts behind. In fact, close to one-half

of the sun’s energy that is absorbed on the Earth’s surface is converted to latent heat,
removing water from wet surfaces by evaporation and from the leaves of plants by
transpiration. The combination of processes, called evapotranspiration, requires an
enormous amount of energy, equivalent to roughly 4,000 times the rate at which we
use energy resources to power our societies.
Evapotranspiration removes an amount of water equivalent to a layer about
1 m thick around the globe each year. About 88 percent of that is evaporation from
the oceans, whereas the remaining 12 percent is evapotranspiration from the land.
The resulting water vapor is transported by moving air masses and eventually condenses and returns to the Earth’s surface as precipitation. There is more evaporation
than precipitation over the oceans, and there is more precipitation than evapotranspiration over the land. The difference between the amount of precipitation and
evapotranspiration on land is water that is returned to the oceans as both stream
flow and groundwater flow. This is termed runoff. Figure 3 illustrates this simple
concept of evapotranspiration, precipitation, and runoff as components of the
hydrologic cycle.
This representation of the hydrologic cycle is highly simplified, masking many
of the complexities of timing and distribution. Snowfall may remain locked in polar
ice for thousands of years; groundwater may emerge at the surface, contributing to
surface water flow and vice versa; droughts and floods attest to the erratic rates of
precipitation; and our own activities, most importantly those contributing to global
climate change, are probably beginning to alter the relative balances in these hydrologic processes.
As the data in Figure 3 indicate, 60 percent of the precipitation falling on the
Earth’s land masses is eventually returned to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration.
Of the 40 percent that does not evaporate, most collects on the surface, flows into
streams and rivers and empties into the oceans, while some seeps into the soil to
become underground water that slowly moves toward the seas. This combined
groundwater and surface water runoff, 47,000 km3/yr, is a renewable supply of

freshwater that can potentially be used year after year without ever depleting the
freshwater resources of the world.
Although the rates of evaporation, precipitation, and runoff are obviously important, the amounts of water stored in various locations and forms are also critical.
It has already been mentioned that almost all of the world’s water is contained in the
oceans. The remainder is distributed as shown in Table 1. Freshwater lakes, rivers,
and streams, which are the main source of water for human use, account for just
0.0072 percent of the world’s stock of water, or about 93,000 km3.

Water Usage
Roughly 10 percent of the world’s annual runoff is withdrawn for human use each
year. While that small figure may suggest ample supplies for the future, that is not at
all the case. Some areas of the world are inundated with water, whereas others have
so little rainfall that human existence is barely possible. Even areas with adequate
average precipitation are vulnerable to chaotic variations from one year to the next.
Unless major water storage and conveyance facilities are constructed, a region may
have plenty of water on the average but not enough to cover needs during dry spells.
As population grows, the demands for water will rise, and the amount available for
each person will drop, as Figure 4 suggests.
The geographic distribution of water does not match well the distribution of
people on the planet. Asia, with 60 percent of the world’s population, has only
36 percent of global runoff, whereas South America, with only 5 percent of the
world’s population, has 25 percent of the runoff. Variations within regions or continents can be extreme. For example, the per capita water availability in North Africa
is less than 7 percent of the African average, which is already low.
As populations grow and development proceeds, rising demands for water
increase the potential for internal disruption within countries and external conflict
with other countries. Many countries depend on local rivers for their water supply,
but their upstream neighbors control the flow, examples of which are given in Table 2.
Egypt, for example, gets 32.3 times as much surface water from precipitation that
falls outside of Egypt as it does from its own rainfall. Moreover, Egypt depends on

the Nile for 97 percent of its surface water supplies, while its neighbor, Ethiopia,
controls almost all of the Nile’s total flow. Similar circumstances exist all around the
globe. Turkey, Syria, and Iraq, for example, share the Euphrates; Bangladesh relies
on the Ganges, which is controlled by India; Israel and Jordan share an uneasy dependence on the Jordan River. As these and other such countries increase their demands for water, stresses between neighbors will no doubt intensify.
When describing how water is used, and especially if comparisons are to be
made with available supplies, we have to be careful about the terminology. For
example, what does it mean to say that a sector of society “uses” a certain amount
of water? For example, almost all of the water that is withdrawn from a river for
power plant cooling is returned to the river (at a slightly higher temperature) and
can be used again. The rest is lost to the atmosphere by evaporation. Downriver,
that same water may sprinkle someone’s lawn. Again, evaporation takes its toll. To
keep track of water usage, it is important to distinguish between consumptive uses
of water, in which water is made unavailable for future use (lost mostly to evaporation), and nonconsumptive uses, in which water serves its purpose for one user and

Withdrawals = Consumption + Returns

Figure 5 provides data on fresh water withdrawals, consumption, and returns
in the United States. Total freshwater withdrawals are about 476 km3/yr, which is
about one-third of the annual runoff. For the whole country, groundwater provides
one-fourth of all withdrawals and surface water provides the other three fourths.
Saline water withdrawals bring the total to 564 km3/yr. However, the distribution of
freshwater withdrawals is very uneven across the country. In Kansas, for example,
close to 60 percent of withdrawals are from groundwater, whereas in Montana, only
2 percent of withdrawals are from groundwater (Hutson et al., 2004).
Although water to cool power plants accounts for almost 40 percent of freshwater withdrawals, essentially all of that water is returned, and it is returned in a
relatively unpolluted condition. If those withdrawals are removed from Figure 5, the
importance of agriculture stands out. Excluding power plant cooling, agriculture accounts for 67 percent of freshwater withdrawals in the United States and 85 percent
of consumption. In some areas, the predominant role of agriculture is even more
dramatic. In drought-prone California, for example, irrigation accounts for over 80
percent of both withdrawals and consumption (excluding cooling water), whereas
municipal withdrawals account for approximately 15 percent of total withdrawals.
As the state continues to grow, water transfers from agricultural uses to cities would
be one way to meet increasing urban needs. A reduction of only 20 percent in agriculture, for example, could double the water supply in cities.

Average per-capita household water use in the United States is about 400 liters
per day (110 gal/person-day). If water for landscaping is not included, it is not
uncommon for one-third of the remaining water to be used for toilet flushings,
another one-third is used for bathing, and the remaining third is for cooking, laundry, and everything else. Table 3 shows some examples of water use for various
household activities, giving standard and water-conserving estimates.

Water Pollutants
Water that has been withdrawn, used for some purpose, and then returned will be
polluted in one way or another. Agricultural return water contains pesticides, fertilizers, and salts; municipal return water carries human sewage, pharmaceuticals, and
surfactants; power plants discharge water that is elevated in temperature; and
industry contributes a wide range of chemical pollutants and organic wastes. To
aggravate the problem, pollutants also enter water from natural sources and from
human sources via nonaqueous routes. Arsenic, antimony, and fluoride often come
from natural mineral deposits through which groundwater flows. Much of the mercury in water is deposited from the air after being emitted from coal combustion.
The polybrominated biphenyl ethers (PBDEs), discussed later in this chapter, are
now found in water throughout the world and are believed to be transported largely
on dust in the air. The list of pollutants that contaminate water is lengthy, so it helps
to organize the list into a smaller number of major categories, as has been done in
the following sections.

181

Water Pollution

Pathogens
It has long been known that contaminated water is responsible for the spread of
many contagious diseases. In a famous study in 1849, Dr. John Snow provided some
of the earliest evidence of the relationship between human waste, drinking water,
and disease. He noted that individuals who drank from a particular well on Broad
Street in London were much more likely to become victims of a local cholera epidemic than those from the same neighborhood who drank from a different well. He
not only found a likely source of the contamination, sewage from the home of a
cholera patient, but he was able to effectively end the epidemic by simply removing
the handle from the pump on the Broad Street well. It wasn’t until later in the nineteenth century, however, when Pasteur and others convincingly established the germ
theory of disease, that the role of pathogenic microorganisms in such epidemics was
understood.
Pathogens are disease-causing organisms that grow and multiply within the
host. The resulting growth of microorganisms in a host is called an infection.
Examples of pathogens associated with water include bacteria, responsible for
cholera, bacillary dysentery (shigellosis), typhoid, and paratyphoid fever; viruses,
responsible for infectious hepatitis and poliomyelitis; protozoa, which cause amebic
dysentery, giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis; and helminths, or parasitic worms, that
cause diseases such as schistosomiasis and dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease).
Although it is not the only source of pathogens in water, contamination by human
feces is the most important. Table 4 provides a more complete list of pathogens
excreted in human feces. The intestinal discharges of an infected individual, a carrier, may contain billions of these pathogens. If they are allowed to enter the water
supply, they can cause epidemics of immense proportions. Carriers may not even
necessarily exhibit symptoms of their disease, which makes it even more important
to carefully protect all water supplies from any human waste contamination. In
developing countries, where resources are scarce, even simple measures can be quite
effective. Household water, for example, is often taken from open wells or streams
that are easily contaminated. By enclosing a well and replacing the dirty rope and
bucket with a less-easily-contaminated handpump, the incidence rate of these diseases can be greatly reduced.
Epidemics of infectious diseases periodically emerge in areas where crowded
conditions and poor sanitation enable the microbes to reach new victims at a rapid
rate. With international travel now commonplace, local epidemics can become
global pandemics. A pandemic of cholera, for example, that began in 1961 in
Indonesia was tracked by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the disease
spread around the globe (Figure 6). By 1970, it had reached Africa, where it spread
quickly and remained for another two decades. It finally jumped to Peru in 1991,
where it killed almost 4,000 people. Within a year, 400,000 new cases of cholera
were reported in South America where there had been almost none before.
There are many ways that contaminated water is associated with infectious
diseases. Waterborne diseases, such as cholera and typhoid, are spread by ingestion
of contaminated water; water-washed diseases, such as trachoma and scabia, are associated with lack of sufficient water to maintain cleanliness; water-based diseases,
such as schistosomiasis and dracunculiasis, involve water contact but don’t require
ingestion; and water-related diseases, such as malaria and dengue, involve a host

that depends on water for its habitat (e.g., mosquitoes), but human contact with the
water is not required. Table 5 shows estimates of global morbidity, mortality, and
numbers of people living in areas where these diseases are common, for a number of
the most prevalent diseases associated with water.
One disease, schistosomiasis (bilharzia), is particularly insidious since mere
contact with contaminated water is sufficient to cause infection, and its incidence
rate is to a large extent the result of water-resource development projects.
Schistosomiasis is one of the most common water-associated diseases in the world,
affecting approximately 200 million people, 200,000 of whom die each year. It is
spread by free-swimming larvae in the water, called cercaria, that attach themselves
to human skin, penetrate it, and enter the bloodstream. Cercaria mature in the liver
into worms that lay masses of eggs on the walls of the intestine. When these eggs are

excreted into water, they hatch and have only a few hours to find a snail host in
which they develop into new cercaria. Cercaria excreted by the snails then have a
few days to find another human host, continuing the cycle. Continuation of the
cycle requires continued contamination by schistosomiasis carriers in waters that
are still enough to allow snails to thrive. Unfortunately, development projects such
as dams and irrigation canals, built in countries with poor sanitation, often lead to
an increase in schistosomiasis by creating the still water conditions needed by the
intermediate hosts, the snails.
Not that long ago, even developed countries such as the United States experienced numerous epidemics of waterborne diseases such as typhoid and cholera. At
the start of the twentieth century, typhoid, for example, was killing approximately
28,000 Americans each year. It was only after the advent of chlorination, which

184

Water Pollution

began in the United States in 1908, that outbreaks of waterborne diseases such as
these became rare. Even now, however, inadequate sanitation in developing countries continues to contribute to high rates of disease and death. The WHO, for
example, estimates that 80 to 100 percent of the illness caused by cholera, typhoid,
and guinea-worm infection could be eliminated in developing countries with
improved water supply and sanitary disposal of excreta (UNEP, 1993).
In the United States, most waterborne diseases are adequately controlled, and
we usually don’t need to worry about water coming from the tap. There are times,
however, when even disinfection is not totally effective, as was the case in Milwaukee,
in 1993, when an outbreak of the gastrointestinal illness, cryptosporidiosis, occurred.
Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that causes diarrhea, abdominal
pain, nausea, and vomiting in its host. For individuals whose immune systems are
compromised, it can be life threatening. Most incidents of cryptosporidiosis have
been traced to water supplies that were contaminated with agricultural runoff containing cattle feces. An infected cow sheds billions of oocysts (eggs) in feces per day
and these oocysts are resistant to the usual chlorine, or chlorine dioxide, disinfection
processes used in water treatment plants. At present, the most suitable method of
removing them at water treatment plants is with microfiltration or with combined
coagulation, flocculation, and depth-filtration processes.
Another protozoan, Giardia lamblia, is less deadly than Cryptosporidium, but
it shares a number of similar characteristics. Giardia cysts can be carried by wild
animals as well as humans; they survive for months in the environment; and they are
not easily destroyed by chlorination. As every backpacker knows these days, it is no
longer safe to drink surface water from even the most sparkling stream because of
the risk of giardiasis caused by the Giardia lamblia.

Oxygen-Demanding Wastes
One of the most important measures of the quality of a water source is the amount of
dissolved oxygen (DO) present. The saturated value of dissolved oxygen in water is
modest, on the order of 8 to 15 mg of oxygen per liter of water, depending on temperature and salinity. The minimum recommended amount of DO for a healthy fish
population has often been set at 5 mg/L, but a more careful analysis of the needs of
different species of fish at different times in their lifecycle yields a range of oxygen
requirements. For example, EPA recommends at least 8 mg/L for coldwater species,
such as trout and salmon, during their embryonic and larval stages, and the first 30
days after hatching, but 5 mg/L is the recommendation for early life stages of
warmwater species such as bluegill and bass. For older fish, EPA recommends a 7day mean minimum of 5 mg/L for coldwater fish and 4 mg/L for warmwater fish.
Oxygen-demanding wastes are substances that oxidize in the receiving body of
water. As bacteria decompose these wastes, they utilize oxygen dissolved in the
water, which reduces the remaining amount of DO. As DO drops, fish and other
aquatic life are threatened and, in the extreme case, killed. In addition, as dissolved
oxygen levels fall, undesirable odors, tastes, and colors reduce the acceptability of
that water as a domestic supply and reduce its attractiveness for recreational uses.
Oxygen-demanding wastes are usually biodegradable organic substances contained

185

Water Pollution

in municipal wastewaters or in effluents from certain industries, such as food processing and paper production. In addition, the oxidation of certain inorganic compounds may contribute to the oxygen demand. Even naturally occurring organic
matter, such as leaves and animal droppings, that finds its way into surface water
contributes to oxygen depletion.
There are several measures of oxygen demand commonly used. The chemical
oxygen demand (COD) is the amount of oxygen needed to chemically oxidize the
wastes, whereas the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is the amount of oxygen
required by microorganisms to biologically degrade the wastes. BOD has traditionally been the most important measure of the strength of organic pollution, and the
amount of BOD reduction in a wastewater treatment plant is a key indicator of
process performance.

Nutrients
Nutrients are chemicals, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon, sulfur, calcium,
potassium, iron, manganese, boron, and cobalt, that are essential to the growth of
living things. In terms of water quality, nutrients can be considered as pollutants
when their concentrations are sufficient to allow excessive growth of aquatic plants,
particularly algae.
Nutrient enrichment can lead to blooms of algae, which eventually die and
decompose. Their decomposition removes oxygen from the water, potentially leading to levels of DO that are insufficient to sustain normal life forms. Algae and
decaying organic matter add color, turbidity, odors, and objectionable tastes to
water that are difficult to remove and that may greatly reduce its acceptability as a
domestic water source. The process of nutrient enrichment, called eutrophication, is
especially important in lakes, and it is described more fully in a later section of this
chapter.
Aquatic species require a long list of nutrients for growth and reproduction, but
from a water-quality perspective, the three most important ones are carbon, nitrogen,
and phosphorus. Plants, including algae, require relatively large amounts of each
of these three nutrients, and unless all three are available, growth will be limited.
The nutrient that is least available relative to the plant’s needs is called the limiting
nutrient. Carbon is usually available from a number of natural sources, including
alkalinity, dissolved carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and decaying organic matter, so it is not often the limiting nutrient. Rather, it is usually either nitrogen or phosphorus that controls algal growth rates. In general, seawater is most often limited by
nitrogen, whereas freshwater lakes are most often limited by phosphorus.
Nutrients as well as other pollution may come from either point-sources or
nonpoint-sources. The most common point-sources are the discharge pipes from
industries and wastewater treatment plants but may also include discharges from
waste disposal sites, mines, animal feedlots, and large construction sites where the
polluted water is collected in networks of pipes or channels and taken to a central
point before discharge. Nonpoint-sources are usually more intermittent than pointsources and are characterized by many points of entry to the receiving water. Runoff
from agricultural lands, pastures and ranges, small construction sites, urban areas,
abandoned mines, and logging sites are typical nonpoint-sources of pollution. Point
sources, which have been the focus of most remedial effort in the past 30 years, are

186

Water Pollution

easier to treat and monitor because they are both more continuous and centralized.
However, nonpoint-sources are now the largest contributor to surface water pollution in the United States, and agriculture is the largest contributor to nonpointsource pollution (Carpenter, 1998; U.S. EPA, 2002).
Major sources of nitrogen include municipal wastewater discharges, runoff
from animal feedlots, chemical fertilizers, and nitrogen-deposition from the atmosphere, especially in the vicinity of coal-fired power plants. In addition, certain bacteria and blue-green algae can obtain their nitrogen directly from the atmosphere.
These life forms are usually abundant in lakes that have high rates of biological
productivity, making the control of nitrogen in such places extremely difficult.
Not only is nitrogen capable of contributing to eutrophication problems, but
when found in drinking water in a particular form, nitrate (NO3), it can pose a serious public health threat. For most people, nitrate in drinking water does not cause a
particular toxicity problem. However, certain bacteria that convert nitrate to nitrite
(NO2) are found in the alkaline digestive tract of infants but not later in adults as
the digestive system becomes more acidic. Hemoglobin in the bloodstream is oxidized by nitrite to methemoglobin, which cannot carry oxygen. The oxygen starvation characteristic of methemoglobinemia causes a bluish discoloration of the
infant; hence, it is commonly referred to as the blue baby syndrome. In extreme
cases, the victim may die from suffocation. Usually after the age of about six
months, the digestive system of a child is sufficiently developed that this syndrome
does not occur.
While there are usually enough natural sources of nitrogen to allow algae and
aquatic weeds to grow, there isn’t much phosphorus available from nature, so it
tends to become the controlling nutrient in rivers and lakes. Human activities, however, often provide enough phosphorus to allow excessive growth of aquatic weeds
and algae. Human sources of phosphorus include agricultural runoff in fertilized
areas, discharges from animal feedlots, and domestic sewage. In sewage, part of the
phosphorus is from human feces and part is from detergents.
Detergent formulations have evolved in response to environmental concerns
since their introduction just after World War II to replace soaps that tended to form
a scum of insoluble precipitates (the ring around the bathtub) in hard water. When
they were first introduced, detergents were nonbiodegradable, which led to mountains of foam on rivers, lakes, and sewage treatment plants, and, in some areas,
foamy water came out of the tap. The problem was caused by the choice of surfactant, which is the ingredient in detergents that lowers the surface tension in water
and allows dirt particles to be lifted or floated from the soiled material during washing. By 1965, the choice of surfactants had changed so that all detergents became
biodegradable, but that caused a new problem. Detergents contained large amounts
of phosphorus, and when that was released during degradation, the phosphorus
acted as a stimulant to algal growth resulting in enormous blooms. Concern for the
environmental effects of phosphorus has now led to reduction in its use in detergents. In many countries, including the United States, phosphorus-containing surfactants have now been largely replaced, but there have been concerns for the safety
of some of the new nonphosphorus-containing surfactants.
Despite the decrease in phosphorus in detergents and the implementation of
phosphorus removal processes at some wastewater treatment plants, phosphorusinduced eutrophication is still the largest water quality problem in lakes, reservoirs,

187

Water Pollution

and ponds in the United States (U.S. EPA, 2002). Most of phosphorus is from nonpoint-sources. It has been estimated that even with no point-source phosphorus
inputs, almost 90 percent of the impaired lakes would still not meet water quality
standards due to the nonpoint-source inputs (Carpenter, 1998). Addition of phosphorus to agricultural land, both in industrial fertilizers and manure, has built up a
phosphorus accumulation in farm and pasture lands that is about 25 percent higher
than background levels (Carpenter, 1998). This excess is steadily being augmented
by application of phosphorus above the needs of the crops being grown and a fraction of the excess finds its way to adjacent rivers, streams, and water bodies, both
dissolved in runoff water and attached to particles carried by the run-off.

Salts
Water naturally accumulates a variety of dissolved solids, or salts, as it passes
through soils and rocks on its way to the sea. These salts typically include such
cations as sodium, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, and anions such as chloride, sulfate, and bicarbonate. A careful analysis of salinity would result in a list of
the concentrations of the primary cations and anions, but a simpler, more commonly
used measure of salinity is the concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS). As a
rough approximation, fresh water can be considered to be water with less than
1,500 mg/L TDS; brackish waters may have TDS values up to 5,000 mg/L; and
saline waters are those with concentrations above 5,000 mg/L (Tchobanoglous &
Shroeder, 1985). Seawater contains 30,000 to 34,000 mg/L TDS.
The concentration of dissolved solids is an important indicator of the usefulness
of water for various applications. Drinking water, for example, has a recommended
maximum TDS concentration of 500 mg/L. Many people will begin to notice water
tastes salty at about 1,000 mg/L of TDS, although this is very dependent on the particular dissolved constituents. Livestock can tolerate higher concentrations. Upper
limits for stock water concentrations quoted by the U.S. Geological Survey (1985)
include poultry at 2,860 mg/L, pigs at 4,290 mg/L, and beef cattle at 10,100 mg/L. Of
greater importance, however, is the salt tolerance of crops. As the concentration of
salts in irrigation water increases above 500 mg/L, the need for careful water management to maintain crop yields becomes increasingly important. With sufficient
drainage to keep salts from accumulating in the soil, up to 1,500 mg/L TDS can be
tolerated by most crops with little loss of yield (Frederick & Hanson, 1982), but at
concentrations above 2,100 mg/L, water is generally unsuitable for irrigation except
for the most salt tolerant of crops.
All naturally occurring water has some amount of salt in it. In addition, many
industries discharge high concentrations of salts, and urban runoff may contain
large amounts in areas where salt is used to keep ice from forming on roads in the
winter. Although such human activities may increase salinity by adding salts to a
given volume of water, it is more often the opposite process, the removal of fresh
water by evaporation, that causes salinity problems. When water evaporates, the
salts are left behind, and since there is less remaining fresh water to dilute them,
their concentration increases.
Irrigated agriculture, especially in arid areas, is always vulnerable to an accumulation of salts due to this evapotranspiration on the cropland itself. The salinity
is enhanced by the increased evaporation in reservoirs that typically accompany

irrigation projects. In addition, irrigation drainage water may pick up additional salt
as it passes over and through soils. As a result, irrigation drainage water is always
higher in salinity than the supply water and, with every reuse, its salt concentration
increases even more. In rivers that are heavily used for irrigation, the salt concentration progressively increases downstream as the volume of water available to dilute
salts decreases due to evaporation, and as the salt load increases due to salty drainage
water returning from irrigated lands. As an example, Table 6 shows decreasing flows
and increasing TDS for the Rio Grande as it travels from New Mexico to Texas.
It has been estimated that roughly one-third of the irrigated lands in the
western part of the United States have a salinity problem that is increasing with
time, including regions in the Lower Colorado River Basin and the west side of the
San Joaquin Valley in California. An estimated 100,000 tons of salt are imported
annually into southern Arizona through its consumption of Colorado River water
via the 300-mile long, Central Arizona Project canal. Salinity problems are also having major impacts on irrigated lands in Iraq, Pakistan, India, Mexico, Argentina,
Mali, and North Africa, among others. The collapse of ancient civilizations, such as
those that once flourished in the Fertile Crescent in what is now Iraq, is thought to
have been precipitated by the demise of irrigated agriculture caused by accumulating
salt (Reisner, 1986).
Salt accumulation in soils is often controlled by flushing the salts away with
additional amounts of irrigation water. This increases costs; wastes water, which
may not be abundantly available in the first place; and unless adequate drainage is
available, increases the likelihood that a rising water table will drown plant roots in
salt-laden water. Providing adequate drainage can be an expensive and challenging
task involving extensive on-farm subsurface drainage systems coupled with a central
drain and disposal system. Even when salt is removed from the agricultural land by
good drainage, it can have later repercussions. In the mid-1980s, it was found that
birdlife in the natural freshwater marshes of the Kesterson Wildlife Refuge in central
California was being poisoned by selenium draining from the region’s agricultural
fields. Since irrigation return water contains not only salts but fertilizers and pesticides as well, finding an acceptable method of disposal is difficult. These issues with
salts highlight how important it is to not only deal with the immediate impacts of
pollution but to develop the remedies so that further downstream impacts are not
created.

189

Water Pollution

Thermal Pollution
A large steam-electric power plant requires an enormous amount of cooling water.
A typical nuclear plant, for example, warms about 150,000 m3/hr of cooling water
by 10°C as it passes through the plant’s condenser. If that heat is released into a
local river or lake, the resulting rise in temperature can adversely affect life in the
vicinity of the thermal plume. For some species, such as trout and salmon, any
increase in temperature is life threatening, although for others warmed water might
be considered beneficial. Within certain limits, thermal additions can promote fish
growth, and fishing may actually be improved in the vicinity of a power plant. On
the other hand, sudden changes in temperature caused by periodic plant outages,
both planned and unanticipated, can make it difficult for the local ecology to ever
acclimate.
As water temperature increases, two factors combine to make it more difficult
for aquatic life to get sufficient oxygen from the water. The first results from the fact
that metabolic rates tend to increase with temperature, generally by a factor of 2 for
each 10°C rise in temperature. This causes an increase in the amount of oxygen
required by organisms. At the same time, the available supplies of dissolved oxygen
(DO) are reduced both because waste assimilation is quicker, drawing down DO at
a faster rate, and because the amount of DO that the water can hold decreases with
temperature. Thus, as temperatures increase, the demand for oxygen goes up, and
the amount of DO available goes down.

Heavy Metals
In some contexts, the definition of a metal is based on physical properties. Metals
are characterized by high thermal and electrical conductivity, high reflectivity and
metallic luster, strength, and ductility. From a chemical perspective, however, it is
more common to use a broader definition that says a metal is an element that will
give up one or more electrons to form a cation in an aqueous solution. These definitions are imprecise, as there are some elements that exhibit both metallic and nonmetallic characteristics and form anions in aqueous solution. These elements are
sometimes referred to as metalloids and include selenium, arsenic, phosphorus,
silicon, and boron. Including the metalloids, about 80 elements can be called metals.
The term heavy metal is less precisely defined. It is often used to refer to metals with
specific gravity greater than about 4 or 5. In terms of their environmental impacts,
the most important heavy metals are mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and
arsenic (As).
Most metals are toxic, including aluminum, arsenic, beryllium, bismuth,
cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel,
selenium, strontium, thallium, tin, titanium, and zinc. Some of these metals, such as
chromium and iron, are essential nutrients in our diets, but in higher doses, they can
cause a range of adverse impacts on the body, including nervous system and kidney
damage, creation of mutations, and induction of tumors. The most important route
for the elimination of metals after they are inside a person is via the kidneys. In fact,
kidneys can be considered to be complex filters whose primary purpose is to eliminate toxic substances from the body. The kidneys contain millions of excretory units
called nephrons, and chemicals that are toxic to the kidneys are called nephrotoxins.
Cadmium, lead, and mercury are examples of nephrotoxic metals.

190

Water Pollution

Metals may be inhaled, as is often the case with lead, for example, and they
may be ingested. How well they are absorbed in the body depends somewhat on the
particular metal in question and the particular form that it exists in. For example,
liquid mercury is not very toxic and most of what is ingested is excreted from the
body. Mercury vapor, on the other hand, is highly toxic. As a vapor, it enters
the lungs where it diffuses into the bloodstream. When blood containing mercury
reaches the brain, the mercury can pass into the brain, where it causes serious
damage to the central nervous system. By contrast, lead does not pose much of a
threat as a vapor since it has such a low vapor pressure, and is most dangerous when
it is dissolved into its ionic form, Pb2 + . Lead dissolved in blood is transferred to vital
organs, including the kidneys and brain, and it readily passes from a pregnant
woman to her fetus. Children and fetuses are the most at risk since their brains
are growing rapidly, and exposure to lead can cause severe and permanent brain
damage.
Metals differ from other toxic substances in that they are totally nondegradable, which means they are virtually indestructible in the environment. Thus, it is
imperative when metal pollution is remediated that the waste products be disposed
of in such a way as to minimize further environmental and human impacts. For
instance, in 2001, a more stringent arsenic standard was passed that will cause an
estimated 30,000 pounds of arsenic to be removed from drinking water annually.
Most of the arsenic-bearing residuals from the water treatment will be sent to
municipal solid waste landfills, where research suggests it may be mobilized into
the landfill leachate—the liquids that drain out of the disposed solid waste. The
questions then become what happens to the leachate, and, if the arsenic moves from
the leachate into another process, for instance, via a sewer to a wastewater treatment plant, what are the risks and fate of the arsenic in this next environmental
compartment.

Pesticides
The term pesticide is used to cover a range of chemicals that kill organisms that
humans consider undesirable. Pesticides can be delineated as insecticides, herbicides,
rodenticides, and fungicides.
There are three main groups of synthetic organic insecticides: organochlorines
(also known as chlorinated hydrocarbons), organophosphates, and carbamates.
The most widely known organochlorine pesticide is DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), which has been widely used to control insects that carry diseases
such as malaria (mosquitoes), typhus (body lice), and plague (fleas). By contributing
to the control of these diseases, DDT is credited with saving literally millions of lives
worldwide. In spite of its more recent reputation as a dangerous pesticide, in terms
of human toxicity, DDT is considered to be relatively safe. In fact organochlorine
insecticides in general are highly toxic to insects, but their acute human toxicity is
relatively low. It was DDT’s impact on food chains, rather than its toxicity to
humans, that led to its ban in the developed countries of the world (it is still used in
developing countries).
Organochlorine pesticides, such as DDT, have two properties that cause them
to be particularly disruptive to food chains. They are very persistent, which means
they last a long time in the environment before being broken down into other

substances, and they are soluble in hydrocarbon solvents, which means they easily
accumulate in fatty tissue. The accumulation of organochlorine pesticides in fatty
tissue means that organisms at successively higher trophic levels in a food chain are
consuming food that has successively higher concentrations of pesticide. At the top
of the food chain, body concentrations of these pesticides are the highest, and it is
there that organochlorine toxicity has been most recognizable. Birds, for example,
are high on the food chain, and it was the adverse effect of DDT on their reproductive success that focused attention on this particular pesticide. DDT, and its metabolite, DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene), interferes with the enzyme that
regulates the distribution of calcium in birds, resulting in eggs with shells that are
too thin to support the weight of the parent. The resulting difficulty to reproduce
has been shown to affect a number of species, including peregrine falcons, bald
eagles, ospreys, and brown pelicans. This is an example of endocrine disruption by
pollutants that will be discussed shortly. As environmental levels of DDT and DDE
subside, some of these species are enjoying a resurgence in numbers. The bald eagle
has been taken off the endangered species list in some areas, such as the Pacific
Northwest and around the Great Lakes.
Other widely used organochlorines included methoxychlor, chlordane, heptachlor, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, endosulfan, and Kepone. Animal studies have
shown that dieldrin, heptachlor, and chlordane produce liver cancers, and aldrin,
dieldrin, and endrin cause birth defects in mice and hamsters. Workers’ exposure to
Kepone in a manufacturing plant in Virginia resulted in severe neurological damage,
and the plant was ultimately closed. Given the ecosystem disruption, their potential
long-term health effects in humans (e.g., cancer), and the biological resistance to
these pesticides that many insect species have developed, organochlorines have
largely been replaced with organophosphates and carbamates.
The organophosphates, such as parathion, malathion, diazinon, TEPP
(tetraethyl prophosphate), and dimethoate, are effective against a wide range of insects, and they are not persistent. However, they are much more acutely toxic to
humans than the organochlorines that they have replaced. They are rapidly absorbed
through the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract, so unless proper precautions are
taken, they are very hazardous to those who use them. Humans exposed to excessive
amounts have shown a range of symptoms, including tremor, confusion, slurred
speech, muscle twitching, and convulsions.
The third category of insecticides, carbamates, is derived from carbamic acid,
H2NCOOH. They are similar to organophosphates in that they are short-lived in the
environment. They, therefore, share that advantage of not being around long enough
to bioaccumulate in food chains, but they also share the disadvantage of high human
toxicity. Popular carbamate pesticides include propoxur, carbaryl, and aldicarb.

192

Acute human exposure to carbamates has led to a range of symptoms such as
nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and, in extreme cases, convulsions and death.

Chlorinated hydrocarbons are also used as herbicides. The chlorophenoxy
compounds 2,4,5-T and 2,4,5-D are among the most well known because they were
used as defoliants in the Vietnam War. Mixed together, they were called Agent
Orange. They can kill broad-leafed plants without harming grasses, and have found
use in controlling excessive growth of aquatic plants in lakes and reservoirs. The
herbicide 2,4,5-T has been banned in part because the manufacturing process that
produces 2,4,5-T also produces a highly toxic side-product, dioxin. Dioxins also
enter the environment as products of combustion from incinerators. Other herbicides include paraquat, which acquired some fame as the pesticide of choice for destroying marijuana, and metolachlor, which is commonly used on soybeans and
corn.

There has been notable success in the past 25 years in producing less persistent, more degradable pesticides. Even though the pesticide may be degraded, its
degradation products may move readily throughout the environment and, in themselves, be toxic to humans or other biota. In recent years, the transformation products of pesticides have been identified in both surface waters and groundwaters and,
in a few cases, in treated drinking water (Coupe & Blomquist, 2004). There is growing concern that not only must we carefully manage and monitor the synthetic
chemical products we manufacture but also the risks associated with their natural
transformation products (Sinclair et al., 2006).

Volatile Organic Chemicals
Volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) are among the most commonly found contaminants in groundwater. They are often used as solvents in industrial processes and a
number of them are either known or suspected carcinogens or mutagens. Their
volatility means they are not often found in concentrations above a few mg/L in surface waters, but in groundwater, their concentrations can be hundreds or thousands

193

Water Pollution

of times higher. Their volatility also suggests the most common method of treatment, which is to aerate the water to encourage them to vaporize and disperse in the
atmosphere. Since volatilization does not destroy the VOC but simply transfers it to
the air, it is important that the resulting atmospheric concentration does not reach a
level of concern.
Five VOCs are especially toxic, and their presence in drinking water is cause
for special concern: vinyl chloride, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, 1,2dichloroethane, and carbon tetrachloride.

The most toxic of the five is vinyl chloride (chloroethylene). It is a known
human carcinogen used primarily in the production of polyvinyl chloride resins.
Tetrachloroethylene is used as a solvent, as a heat transfer medium, and in the manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons. It causes tumors in animals, but there is inadequate evidence to call it a human carcinogen. Of the five, it is the one most
commonly found in groundwater. Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a solvent that was
quite commonly used to clean everything from electronics parts to jet engines and
septic tanks. It is a suspected carcinogen and is among the most frequently found
contaminants in groundwater. 1,2-dichloroethane is a metal degreaser that is also
used in the manufacture of a number of products, including vinyl chloride,
tetraethyllead, fumigants, varnish removers, and soap compounds. Though it is not
a known carcinogen, high levels of exposure are known to cause injury to the central nervous system, liver, and kidneys. It is also a common groundwater contaminant that is soluble, making it one of the more difficult to remove by air stripping.
Carbon tetrachloride was a common household cleaning agent that is now more
often used in grain fumigants, fire extinguishers, and solvents. It is very toxic if ingested; only a few milliliters can produce death. It is relatively insoluble in water,
and therefore only occasionally found in contaminated groundwater.

Emerging Contaminants
As of January 2006, there were more than 239,000 substances on the CAS (Chemical
Abstracts Service) list of regulated chemicals (CAS, 2006), and there are 4,800
chemicals whose production exceeds 1,000 tonnes/year (OECD, 2004). Not all
potential pollutants are synthetic chemicals. Many are naturally occurring organisms or materials, such as pathogens and metals. This said, how is it possible to

194

Water Pollution

identify and prioritize those potential pollutants, or classes of pollutants, of most
environmental concern? The answer is not straightforward but has to do with such
things as the substance’s environmental persistence; relative toxicity or deleterious
impact (both to humans and other biota); occurrence frequency and concentration;
and immediacy of impact. Since the 1990s, many previously little-recognized pollutants have become classified as emerging contaminants—contaminants that by
meeting some combination of the foregoing attributes warrant particular interest
and concern. Much of this trend in identifying and characterizing emerging contaminants impacts depends on improvements in instrumentation, sampling, and analytic
techniques (Muir & Howard, 2006).
Foremost among the emerging contaminants are endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Since Our Stolen Future (Colborn) drew widespread attention to how
EDCs may be interfering with the hormonal control of development in humans and
wildlife, a wave of literature has been published documenting how numerous chemicals adversely affect normal endocrine system functioning. After the genetic code is
implanted, an organism’s development, behavior, and metabolism are largely dictated by an intricate system of chemical signaling and response controlled by the
endocrine system. EDCs interfere with the natural functioning of this system either
by being or acting like a natural hormone, blocking or counteracting the action of a
natural hormone, or increasing or reducing the production of natural hormones.
Hermaphroditism (the presence of both male and female reproductive organs in a
single organism) and impaired offspring survival and development have been
reported in frogs, salmon, oysters, newts, trout, and turtles exposed to EDCs.
For instance, 84 percent of the female Chinook salmon in one Columbia River
study were found to have undergone sex reversal early in development and were,
in fact, chromosomally males (Nagler et al., 2001). Estrogenic compounds, like
17b-estradiol (the natural female sex hormone) and ethinylestradiol (the analog of
17b-estradiol that is in birth control pills), have received the most attention among
EDCs and have been shown to cause reproductive and developmental effects in fish
and amphibians at levels measured in the environment (Kavlock & Daston, 1996).
At present, there is no firm evidence that the environmentally measured concentrations of EDCs are causing human health effects, although it has been suggested that
EDCs are a factor in reduced sperm counts and increased incidences of breast and
reproductive organ cancers (Snyder, Pleus, and Snyder, 2005). Hundreds of chemicals, including flame retardants, metals (e.g., arsenic, cadmium), pesticides, natural
plant material, detergents, combustion byproducts, and pharmaceuticals are considered to be possible EDCs.
Polybrominated biphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are used widely as flame retardant additives, and perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs), which are waste and transformation products from the manufacture of fluorine containing surface treatments and
lubricants, are now found in environments throughout the globe, including snow and
mammal in the Arctic (Streets et al., 2006, and Scott et al., 2006). Both classes of
compounds have been observed to bioaccumulate and possibly exhibit toxicity or
endocrine disruption in wildlife and humans. With improved analytic techniques,
many new pathogenic organisms have also been identified. Human adenoviruses
have now been found around the world in surface waters (Jiang, 2006). Rapidly increasing incidences of antibiotic-resistant pathogens are a concern as they threaten
to make medical remedies, such as penicillin, obsolete (Pruden et al., 2006). Bacterial

195

Water Pollution

pathogens have been found to grow in amoebas, which inhabit cooling towers, and
are possibly spread through aqueous aerosols from the towers (Berk et al., 2006). In
addition, manufacture and application of nanoparticles (materials with functionalities at the near-atomic scale) is growing exponentially along with the exposure of
humans and the environment to these materials. Nanoparticles are now commonly
found in paints, surface coatings, food additives, polishing compounds, industrial
catalysts, and personal care products. However, basic study of the environmental fate
and toxic impacts of these materials has only recently begun (Brunner et al., 2006).
The foregoing list of emerging contaminants is not an exhaustive list but merely indicates the breadth of pollutants involved and the nature of some of the challenges for
future environmental engineers and scientists.

Status of Surface Water Quality
As a way to help monitor progress toward the goals of the Clean Water Act, states are
required to submit water quality assessments of their rivers, lakes, and estuaries. The
starting point for these assessments is a designation of the beneficial uses that individual bodies of water shall be required to support. The EPA provides guidance on
these beneficial uses, as shown in Table 7. The Clean Water Act authorizes the states
to set their own water quality standards that accompany these beneficial uses, as long
as those standards comply with the “fishable and swimmable” goals of the Act.
The water quality assessments that the states must submit identify sources of
pollution and the fraction of the resource that is “impaired” by pollutants. A body
of water is said to be impaired when at least one of the designated beneficial uses,
such as recreational swimming or fish consumption, is not being supported by the
quality of water. The water quality assessments submitted in 2000 showed that

39 percent of the assessed miles of river, and 45 percent of the assessed area of lakes,
were impaired for one reason or another (U.S. EPA, 2002).
A pollutant or a stressor may cause surface water quality impairment.
Stressors are physical changes to the water body. For instance, a habitat alteration stressor encompasses activities that alter aquatic habitat (but not the water
flow), such as removal of rocks from the bottom of a stream, whereas a flow alteration stressor includes activities such as damming a river or withdrawing irrigation
water from a stream. The most important pollutants and stressors that cause
impairment of water quality in rivers and streams are shown in Figure 7a, and the

leading sources of those problems are given in Figure 7b. The most common problems are pathogens (measured by bacterial counts) and siltation. Pathogens enter
rivers from poorly treated sewage discharges, wildlife fecal matter, and run-off from
farms and feedlots. The presence of pathogens suggests use of the water without
further treatment may cause human illness. Siltation is caused by solids washed off
of plowed fields, logging sites, urban areas, and stream banks when it rains. The
resulting sediment load can smother habitats needed by fish and other aquatic
organisms. In the United States, the leading source of river and stream impairment
is agricultural activity, including crop production and animal husbandry.
The pollutants and sources of impairment for lakes and reservoirs are shown
in Figure 8. Lakes and reservoirs are most often impaired by nutrients and metals
coming from nonpoint-sources. Agricultural run-off causes the most problems, but

urban run-off and hydrologic modification (which includes such things as flow regulation and dredging) are also very important. Because more than one pollutant or
process may impact a given lake or river, the percentages in Figures 7 and 8 add up
to more than 100 percent.

Biochemical Oxygen Demand
Surface water is obviously highly susceptible to contamination. It has historically
been the most convenient sewer for industry and municipalities alike, while at the
same time, it is the source of the majority of our water for all purposes. One particular category of pollutants, oxygen-demanding wastes, has been such a pervasive
surface-water problem, affecting both moving water and still water, that it will be
given special attention.
When biodegradable organic matter is released into a body of water, microorganisms, especially bacteria, feed on the wastes, breaking them down into simpler
organic and inorganic substances. When this decomposition takes place in an
aerobic environment—that is, in the presence of oxygen—the process produces
nonobjectionable, stable end products such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfate (SO4),
orthophosphate (PO4), and nitrate (NO3). A simplified representation of aerobic
decomposition is given by the following:
Organic matter + O2

Microorganisms"

CO2 + H2O + New cells + Stable products (NO3, PO4, SO4, . . .)

When insufficient oxygen is available, the resulting anaerobic decomposition
is performed by completely different microorganisms. They produce end products
that can be highly objectionable, including hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3),
and methane (CH4). Anaerobic decomposition can be represented by the following:
Organic matter

Microorganisms"

CO2 + H2O + New cells + Unstable products (H2S, NH3, CH4, . . .)

The methane produced is physically stable, biologically degradable, and a potent
greenhouse gas. When emitted from bodies of water, it is often called swamp gas. It
is also generated in the anaerobic environment of landfills, where it is sometimes
collected and used as an energy source.
The amount of oxygen required by microorganisms to oxidize organic wastes
aerobically is called the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). BOD may have various
units, but most often, it is expressed in milligrams of oxygen required per liter of
wastewater (mg/L). The BOD, in turn, is made up of two parts: the carbonaceous
oxygen demand (CBOD) and the nitrogenous oxygen demand (NBOD). Those distinctions will be clarified later.

Five-Day BOD Test
The total amount of oxygen that will be required for biodegradation is an important
measure of the impact that a given waste will have on the receiving body of water.
While we could imagine a test in which the oxygen required to degrade completely a
sample of waste would be measured, for routine purposes, such a test would take
too long to be practical (at least several weeks would be required). As a result, it has

199

Water Pollution

become standard practice simply to measure and report the oxygen demand over a
shorter, restricted period of five days, realizing that the ultimate demand may be
considerably higher.
The five-day BOD, or BOD5, is the total amount of oxygen consumed by
microorganisms during the first five days of biodegradation. In its simplest form, a
BOD5 test would involve putting a sample of waste into a stoppered bottle and
measuring the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the sample at the beginning of the test and again five days later. The difference in DO divided by the volume
of waste would be the five-day BOD. Light must be kept out of the bottle to keep
algae from adding oxygen by photosynthesis, and the bottle is sealed to keep air
from replenishing DO that has been removed by biodegradation. To standardize the
procedure, the test is run at a fixed temperature of 20°C. Since the oxygen demand
of typical waste is several hundred milligrams per liter, and the saturated value of
DO for water at 20°C is only 9.1 mg/L, it is usually necessary to dilute the sample to
keep the final DO above zero. If during the five days, the DO drops to zero, the test
is invalid because more oxygen would have been removed had more been available.
The five-day BOD of a diluted sample is given by
BOD5 =

DOi - DOf
P

(2)

where
DOi = the initial dissolved oxygen (DO) of the diluted wastewater
DOf = the DO of the diluted wastewater, 5 days later
volume of wastewater
P = the dilution fraction =
volume of wastewater plus dilution water
A standard BOD bottle holds 300 mL, so P is just the volume of wastewater divided
by 300 mL.
EXAMPLE 1 Unseeded Five-Day BOD Test
A 10.0-mL sample of sewage mixed with enough water to fill a 300-mL bottle
has an initial DO of 9.0 mg/L. To help assure an accurate test, it is desirable to
have at least a 2.0-mg/L drop in DO during the five-day run, and the final DO
should be at least 2.0 mg/L. For what range of BOD5 would this dilution produce
the desired results?
Solution The dilution fraction is P = 10>300. To get at least a 2.0-mg/L drop
in DO, the minimum BOD needs to be
BOD5 Ú

2.0 mg/L

To assure at least 2.0 mg/L of DO remains after five days requires that

This dilution will be satisfactory for BOD5 values between 60 and 210 mg/L.

So far, we have assumed that the dilution water added to the waste sample has
no BOD of its own, which would be the case if pure water were added. In some
cases it is necessary to seed the dilution water with microorganisms to assure that
there is an adequate bacterial population to carry out the biodegradation. In such
cases, to find the BOD of the waste itself, it is necessary to subtract the oxygen
demand caused by the seed from the demand in the mixed sample of waste and
dilution water.
To sort out the effect of seeded dilution water from the waste itself, two BOD
bottles must be prepared, one containing just the seeded dilution water and the other
containing the mixture of both the wastewater and seeded dilution water (Figure 9).
The change in DO in the bottle containing just seeded dilution water (called the
“blank”) as well as the change in DO in the mixture are then noted. The oxygen demand of the waste itself (BODw) can then be determined as follows:
BODmVm = BODwVw + BODdVd

(5)

Substituting the definitions of P and (1 - P) into (5) gives

(6)

Because
BODm = DOi - DOf

and

BODd = Bi - Bf

where
Bi = initial DO in the seeded dilution water (blank)
Bf = final DO in the seeded dilution water
our final expression for the BOD of the waste itself is thus
BODw =

(DOi - DOf) - (Bi - Bf)(1 - P)
P

(7)

EXAMPLE 2 A Seeded BOD Test
A test bottle containing just seeded dilution water has its DO level drop by
1.0 mg/L in a five-day test. A 300-mL BOD bottle filled with 15 mL of wastewater and the rest seeded dilution water (sometimes expressed as a dilution of
1:20) experiences a drop of 7.2 mg/L in the same time period. What would be the
five-day BOD of the waste?
Solution

The dilution factor P is
P = 15>300 = 0.05

Using (7), the five-day BOD of the waste would be
BOD5 =

7.2 - 1.0(1 - 0.05)
= 125 mg/L
0.05

Modeling BOD as a First-Order Reaction
Suppose we imagine a flask with some biodegradable organic waste in it. As bacteria oxidize the waste, the amount of organic matter remaining in the flask will
decrease with time until eventually it all disappears. Another way to describe the
organic matter in the flask is to say as time goes on, the amount of organic matter
already oxidized goes up until finally all of the original organic matter has been
oxidized. Figure 10 shows these two equivalent ways to describe the organic matter.
We can also describe oxygen demand from those same two perspectives. We could
say that the remaining demand for oxygen to decompose the wastes decreases with
time until there is no more demand, or we could say the amount of oxygen

202

FIGURE 10 Two equivalent ways to describe the time dependence of organic matter
in a flask.

demand already exerted, or utilized, starts at zero and rises until all of the original
oxygen demand has been satisfied.
Translating Figure 10 into a mathematical description is straightforward. To
do so, it is assumed that the rate of decomposition of organic wastes is proportional
to the amount of waste that is left in the flask. If we let Lt represent the amount of
oxygen demand left after time t, then, assuming a first-order reaction, we can write
dLt
= - kLt
dt

(8)

where k = the BOD reaction constant (time - 1).
The solution to (8) is
Lt = L0e - kt

(9)

where L0 is the ultimate carbonaceous oxygen demand. It is the total amount of
oxygen required by microorganisms to oxidize the carbonaceous portion of the
waste to simple carbon dioxide and water. (Later, we will see that there is an additional demand for oxygen associated with the oxidation of nitrogen compounds.)
The ultimate carbonaceous oxygen demand is the sum of the amount of oxygen
already consumed by the waste in the first t days (BODt), plus the amount of
oxygen remaining to be consumed after time t. That is,
L0 = BODt + Lt

(10)

BODt = L0 (1 - e - kt)

(11)

Combining (9) and (10) gives us

A graph of Eqs. (9) and (11) is presented in Figure 11. If these two figures are
combined, the result would look exactly like Figure 10. Notice that oxygen demand
can be described by the BOD remaining (you might want to think of Lt as how much
oxygen demand is Left at time t), as in Figure 11a, or equivalently as oxygen demand
already satisfied (or utilized, or exerted), BODt, as in Figure 11b. Also notice how the
five-day BOD is more easily described using the BOD utilized curve.
Sometimes the analysis leading to (11) is made using logarithms to the base 10
rather than the base e, as they were here. The relationship equivalent to (11), but in

where uppercase K is the reaction rate coefficient to the base 10. It is easy to show that

(13)

EXAMPLE 3 Estimating L0 from BOD5
The dilution factor P for an unseeded mixture of waste and water is 0.030. The
DO of the mixture is initially 9.0 mg/L, and after five days, it has dropped to
3.0 mg/L. The reaction rate constant k has been found to be 0.22 day - 1.
a. What is the five-day BOD of the waste?
b. What would be the ultimate carbonaceous BOD?
c. What would be the remaining oxygen demand after five days?

(1 - e - 0.22 * 5)

c. After five days, 200 mg/L of oxygen demand out of the total 300 mg/L
would have already been used. The remaining oxygen demand would therefore be (300 - 200) mg/L = 100 mg/L.

The BOD Reaction Rate Constant k
The BOD reaction rate constant k is a factor that indicates the rate of biodegradation of wastes. As k increases, the rate at which dissolved oxygen is used increases,
although the ultimate amount required, L0, does not change. The reaction rate will
depend on a number of factors, including the nature of the waste itself (for example,
simple sugars and starches degrade easily while cellulose does not), the ability of
the available microorganisms to degrade the wastes in question (it may take some
time for a healthy population of organisms to be able to thrive on the particular
waste in question), and the temperature (as temperatures increase, so does the rate
of biodegradation).
Some typical values of the BOD reaction rate constant, at 20°C, are given in
Table 8. Notice that raw sewage has a higher rate constant than either well-treated
sewage or polluted river water. This is because raw sewage contains a larger proportion of easily degradable organics that exert their oxygen demand quite quickly,
leaving a remainder that decays more slowly.
The rate of biodegradation of wastes increases with increasing temperature. To
account for these changes, the reaction rate constant k is often modified using the
following equation:
kT = k20u(T - 20)

where k20 is the reaction rate constant at the standard 20°C laboratory reference
temperature, and kT is the reaction rate at a different temperature T (expressed
in °C). The most commonly used value for u is 1.047, and although u is somewhat
temperature dependent, that single value will suffice for our purposes.
EXAMPLE 4 Temperature Dependence of BOD5
In Example 3, the wastes had an ultimate BOD equal to 300 mg/L. At 20°C, the
five-day BOD was 200 mg/L, and the reaction rate constant was 0.22/day. What
would the five-day BOD of this waste be at 25°C?
Solution First we will adjust the reaction rate constant with (14) using a value
of u equal to 1.047:
k25 = k20u(T - 20) = 0.22 * (1.047)(25 - 20) = 0.277/day
So, from (12),
BOD5 = L0(1 - e - k5) = 300(1 - e - 0.277 * 5) = 225 mg/L
Notice that the five-day BOD at 25°C is somewhat higher than the 20°C value of
200 mg/L. The same total amount of oxygen is required at either temperature,
but as temperature increases, it gets used sooner.

Nitrification
So far, it has been assumed that the only oxygen demand is associated with the
biodegradation of the carbonaceous portion of the wastes. There is a significant additional demand, however, caused by the oxidation of nitrogen compounds.
Nitrogen is the critical element required for protein synthesis and, hence, is
essential to life. When living things die or excrete waste products, nitrogen that
was tied to complex organic molecules is converted to ammonia (NH3) by bacteria
and fungi. Then, in aerobic environments, nitrite bacteria (Nitrosomonas) convert
ammonia to nitrite (NO2- ), and nitrate bacteria (Nitrobacter) convert nitrite to
nitrate (NO3- ). This process, called nitrification, can be represented with the following two reactions:
2 NH3 + 3 O2
2 NO2- + O2

Nitrosomonas"
Nitrobacter

2 NO2- + 2 H + + 2 H2O

" 2 NO 3

(15)
(16)

This conversion of ammonia to nitrate requires oxygen, so nitrification exerts
its own oxygen demand. Thus, we have the combination of oxygen requirements.
The oxygen needed to oxidize organic carbon to carbon dioxide is called the
carbonaceous oxygen demand (CBOD), and the oxygen needed to convert ammonia
to nitrate is called the nitrogenous oxygen demand (NBOD).
Nitrification is just one part of the biogeochemical cycle for nitrogen. In the
atmosphere nitrogen is principally in the form of molecular nitrogen (N2) with a

small but important fraction being nitrous oxide (N2O). (Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas.) Nitrogen in the form of N2 is unusable by plants and must first be transformed into either ammonia (NH3) or nitrate (NO3- ) in the process called nitrogen
fixation. Nitrogen fixation occurs during electrical storms when N2 oxidizes, combines with water, and is rained out as HNO3. Certain bacteria and blue-green algae
are also capable of fixing nitrogen. Under anaerobic conditions, certain denitrifying
bacteria are capable of reducing NO3- back into NO2 and N2, completing the nitrogen cycle.
The entire nitrogen cycle obviously is important, but our concern in this section is with the nitrification process itself, in which organic-nitrogen in waste is converted to ammonia, ammonia to nitrite, and nitrite to nitrate. Figure 12 shows this
sequential process, starting with all of the nitrogen bound up in organic form and
weeks later ending with all of the nitrogen in the form of nitrate. Notice that the
conversion of ammonia to nitrite does not begin right away, which means the
nitrogenous biochemical oxygen demand does not begin to be exerted until a number of days have passed.
Figure 13 illustrates the carbonaceous and nitrogenous oxygen demands
as they might be exerted for typical municipal wastes. Notice that the NBOD does
not normally begin to exert itself for at least five to eight days, so most five-day tests
are not affected by nitrification. In fact, the potential for nitrification to interfere
with the standard measurement for CBOD was an important consideration in
choosing the standard five-day period for BOD tests. To avoid further nitrification
complications, it is now an accepted practice to modify wastes in a way that will
inhibit nitrification during that five-day period.
A stoichiometric analysis of (15) and (16) allows us to quantify the oxygen demand associated with nitrification, as the following example illustrates.

EXAMPLE 5 Nitrogenous Oxygen Demand
Some domestic wastewater has 30 mg/L of nitrogen in the form of either organic
nitrogen or ammonia. Assuming that very few new cells of bacteria are formed
during the nitrification of the waste (that is, the oxygen demand can be found from
a simple stoichiometric analysis of the nitrification reactions given above), find
a. The ultimate nitrogenous oxygen demand
b. The ratio of the ultimate NBOD to the concentration of nitrogen in the waste.
Solution
a. Combining the two nitrification reactions (15) and (16) yields
NH3 + 2O2 : NO3- + H + + H2O

(17)

The molecular weight of NH3 is 17, and the molecular weight of O2 is 32. The
foregoing reaction indicates that 1 g-mol of NH3 (17 g) requires 2 g-mole of
O2 (2 * 32 = 64 g). Since 17 g of NH3 contains 14 g of N, and the concentration of N is 30 mg/L, we can find the final, or ultimate, NBOD:
NBOD = 30 mg N/L *

17g NH3
14 g N

64 g O2
*

17 g NH3

= 137 mg O2/L

b. The oxygen demand due to nitrification divided by the concentration of
nitrogen in the waste is
137 mg O2/L
30 mg N/L

208

= 4.57 mg O2/mg N

Water Pollution

The total concentration of organic and ammonia nitrogen in wastewater is
known as the total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN). As was demonstrated in the preceding
example, the nitrogenous oxygen demand can be estimated by multiplying the TKN
by 4.57. This is a result worth noting:
Ultimate NBOD L 4.57 * TKN

(18)

Since untreated domestic wastewaters typically contain approximately
15–50 mg/L of TKN, the oxygen demand caused by nitrification is considerable,
ranging from roughly 70 to 230 mg/L. For comparison, typical raw sewage has an
ultimate carbonaceous oxygen demand of 250–350 mg/L.

Other Measures of Oxygen Demand
In addition to the CBOD and NBOD measures already presented, two other indicators are sometimes used to describe the oxygen demand of wastes. These are the
theoretical oxygen demand (ThOD) and the chemical oxygen demand (COD).
The theoretical oxygen demand is the amount of oxygen required to oxidize
completely a particular organic substance, as calculated from simple stoichiometric
considerations. Stoichiometric analysis, however, for both the carbonaceous and nitrogenous components, tends to overestimate the amount of oxygen actually consumed during decomposition. The explanation for this discrepancy is based on a
more careful understanding of how microorganisms actually decompose waste.
While there is plenty of food for bacteria, they rapidly consume waste, and in the
process, convert some of it to cell tissue. As the amount of remaining wastes diminishes, bacteria begin to draw on their own tissue for the energy they need to survive,
a process called endogenous respiration. Eventually, as bacteria die, they become the
food supply for other bacteria; all the while, protozoa act as predators, consuming
both living and dead bacteria. Throughout this sequence, more and more of the original waste is consumed until finally all that remains is some organic matter, called
humus, that stubbornly resists degradation. The discrepancy between theoretical and
actual oxygen demands is explained by carbon still bound up in humus. The calculation of theoretical oxygen demand is of limited usefulness in practice because it presupposes a particular, single pollutant with a known chemical formula. Even if that
is the case, the demand is overestimated.
Some organic matter, such as cellulose, phenols, benzene, and tannic acid,
resist biodegradation. Other types of organic matter, such as pesticides and various
industrial chemicals, are nonbiodegradable because they are toxic to microorganisms. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) is a measured quantity that does not
depend either on the ability of microorganisms to degrade the waste or on knowledge of the particular substances in question. In a COD test, a strong chemical oxidizing agent is used to oxidize the organics rather than relying on microorganisms to
do the job. The COD test is much quicker than a BOD test, taking only a matter of
hours. However, it does not distinguish between the oxygen demand that will actually be felt in a natural environment due to biodegradation and the chemical oxidation of inert organic matter. It also does not provide any information on the rate at
which actual biodegradation will take place. The measured value of COD is higher
than BOD, though for easily biodegradable matter, the two will be similar. In fact,
the COD test is sometimes used as a way to estimate the ultimate BOD.

The Effect of Oxygen-Demanding Wastes on Rivers
The amount of dissolved oxygen in water is one of the most commonly used indicators of a river’s health. As DO drops below 4 or 5 mg/L, the forms of life that can
survive begin to be reduced. In the extreme case, when anaerobic conditions exist,
most higher forms of life are killed or driven off. Noxious conditions then prevail,
including floating sludges; bubbling, odorous gases; and slimy fungal growths.
A number of factors affect the amount of DO available in a river. Oxygendemanding wastes remove DO; photosynthesis adds DO during the day, but those
plants remove oxygen at night; and the respiration of organisms living in the water
as well as in sediments removes oxygen. In addition, tributaries bring their own oxygen supplies, which mix with those of the main river. In the summer, rising temperatures reduce the solubility of oxygen, while lower flows reduce the rate at which
oxygen enters the water from the atmosphere. In the winter, ice may form, blocking
access to new atmospheric oxygen. To model properly all of these effects and their
interactions is a difficult task. A simple analysis, however, can provide insight into
the most important parameters that affect DO. We should remember, however, that
our results are only a first approximation to reality.
The simplest model of the oxygen resources in a river focuses on two key
processes: the removal of oxygen by microorganisms during biodegradation, and
the replenishment of oxygen through reaeration at the interface between the river
and the atmosphere. In this simple model, it is assumed that there is a continuous
discharge of waste at a given location on the river. As the water and wastes flow
downriver, it is assumed that they are uniformly mixed at any given cross section of
river, and it is assumed that there is no dispersion of wastes in the direction of flow.
These assumptions are part of what is referred to as the point-source, plug flow
model, illustrated in Figure 14.

Deoxygenation
The rate of deoxygenation at any point in the river is assumed to be proportional to
the BOD remaining at that point. That is,
Rate of deoxygenation = kdLt

(19)

where
kd = the deoxygenation rate constant (day - 1)
Lt = the BOD remaining t (days) after the wastes enter the river, (mg/L)
The deoxygenation rate constant kd is often assumed to be the same as the (temperature adjusted) BOD rate constant k obtained in a standard laboratory BOD test.
For deep, slowly moving rivers, this seems to be a reasonable approximation, but
for turbulent, shallow, rapidly moving streams, the approximation is less valid. Such
streams have deoxygenation constants that can be significantly higher than the
values determined in the laboratory.
Substituting (9), which gives BOD remaining after time t, into (19) gives
Rate of deoxygenation = kdL0e - kdt

EXAMPLE 6 Downstream BOD
A wastewater treatment plant serving a city of 200,000 discharges 1.10 m3/s of
treated effluent having an ultimate BOD of 50.0 mg/L into a stream that has a
flow of 8.70 m3/s and a BOD of its own equal to 6.0 mg/L. The deoxygenation
constant, kd, is 0.20/day.
a. Assuming complete and instantaneous mixing, estimate the ultimate BOD
of the river just downstream from the outfall.
b. If the stream has a constant cross section, so that it flows at a fixed speed
equal to 0.30 m/s, estimate the BOD remaining in the stream at a distance
30,000 m downstream.
Solution
a. The BOD of the mixture of effluent and streamwater can be found using
(21):
L0 =

1.10 m3/s * 50.0 mg/L + 8.70 m3/s * 6.0 mg/L
(1.10 + 8.70 ) m3/s

= 10.9 mg/L

211

b. At a speed of 0.30 m/s, the time required for the waste to reach a distance

So the BOD remaining at that point, 30 km downstream, would be
Lt = L0e - kdt = 10.9 e - (0.2>d * 1.16d) = 8.7 mg/L

Reaeration
The rate at which oxygen is replenished is assumed to be proportional to the difference between the actual DO in the river at any given location and the saturated
value of dissolved oxygen. This difference is called the oxygen deficit, D:
Rate of reaeration = krD

The reaeration constant, kr, is very much dependent on the particular conditions in the river. A fast-moving, whitewater river will have a much higher reaeration
constant than a sluggish stream or a pond. Many attempts have been made empirically to relate key stream parameters to the reaeration constant, with one of the most
commonly used formulations being the following (O’Connor and Dobbins, 1958):
kr =

3.9 u1>2
H3>2

(24)

where
kr = reaeration coefficient at 20°C (day - 1)
u = average stream velocity (m/s)
H = average stream depth (m)
Typical values of the reaeration constant kr for various bodies of water are given in
Table 9. Adjustments to the reaeration rate constant for temperatures other than
20°C can be made using (14) but with a temperature coefficient u equal to 1.024.
The saturated value of dissolved oxygen varies with temperature, atmospheric
pressure, and salinity. Table 10 gives representative values of the solubility of oxygen
in water at various temperatures and chloride concentrations.
Both the wastewater that is being discharged into a stream and the stream
itself are likely to have some oxygen deficit. If we assume complete mixing of the
two, we can calculate the initial deficit of the polluted river using a weighted average
based on their individual concentrations of dissolved oxygen:
D0 = DOs -

EXAMPLE 7 Initial Oxygen Deficit
The waste water in Example 6 has a dissolved oxygen concentration of 2.0 mg/L
and a discharge rate of 1.10 m3/s. The river that is receiving this waste has DO
equal to 8.3 mg/L, a flow rate of 8.70 m3/s, and a temperature of 20°C. Assuming
complete and instantaneous mixing, estimate the initial dissolved oxygen deficit
of the mixture of wastewater and river water just downstream from the discharge
point.
Solution The initial amount of dissolved oxygen in the mixture of waste and
river water would be
DO =

1.10 m3/s * 2.0 mg/L + 8.70 m3/s * 8.3 mg/L
(1.10 + 8.70) m3/s

= 7.6 mg/L

213

Water Pollution

The saturated value of dissolved oxygen DOs at 20°C is given in Table 10 as 9.09
mg/L, so the initial deficit would be
D0 = 9.09 mg/L - 7.6 mg/L = 1.5 mg/L

The Oxygen Sag Curve
The deoxygenation caused by microbial decomposition of wastes and oxygenation
by reaeration are competing processes that are simultaneously removing and adding
oxygen to a stream. Combining the two equations (20) and (22) yields the following
expression for the rate of increase of the oxygen deficit:
Rate of increase of the deficit = Rate of deoxygenation - Rate of reaeration
dD
= kdL0e - kdt - krD
dt

(26)

which has the solution
D =

kdL0
(e - kdt - e - krt) + D0e - krt
kr - kd

(27)

Since the deficit D is the difference between the saturation value of dissolved
oxygen DOs and the actual value DO, we can write the equation for the DO as
DO = DOs - c

kdL0
(e - kdt - e - krt) + D0e - krt d
kr - kd

(28)

Equation (28) is the classic Streeter-Phelps oxygen sag equation first described
in 1925. A plot of DO following Streeter-Phelps behavior is given in Figure 15. As can
be seen, there is a stretch of river immediately downstream of the discharge point
where the DO drops rapidly. At the critical point downstream, dissolved oxygen
reaches its minimum value and river conditions are at their worst. Beyond the critical
point, the remaining organic matter in the river has diminished to the point where

oxygen is being added to the river by reaeration faster than it is being withdrawn by
decomposition, and the river begins to recover.
We can add a few more things to this analysis of oxygen deficit. For the special
case where kr = kd, the denominator in (27) goes to zero, which is mathematically
unacceptable, so the equation needs to be rederived under those conditions. Under
these circumstances, the solution to (26) becomes
D = (kdL0t + D0)e - kdt

(29)

If the stream has a constant cross-sectional area and is traveling at a speed u,
then time and distance downstream are related by
x = ut

(30)

where
x = distance downstream
u = stream speed
t = elapsed time between discharge point and distance x downstream
Equation (27) can be rewritten as
D =

kdL0
(e - kdx>u - e - krx>u) + D0e - krx>u
kr - kd

(31)

The location of the critical point and the corresponding minimum value of DO
is of obvious importance. At this point stream conditions are at their worst. Setting
the derivative of the oxygen deficit equal to zero and solving for the critical time yields
tc =

kr
D0(kr - kd)

lne c1 df

(32)

The maximum deficit can then be found by substituting the value obtained for the
critical time, tc, into (28).
The oxygen sag curve should make some intuitive sense, even without the
mathematical analysis. Near the outfall, there is so much organic matter being
degraded that the rate of removal of oxygen from the water is higher than the rate
that it can be returned by reaeration, so the dissolved oxygen drops. As we move
further downstream, less and less organic matter remains, so the rate of removal of
oxygen keeps dropping as well. At the critical point, the rate of removal of oxygen
equals the rate of addition of oxygen by reaeration. Beyond the critical point, reaeration begins to dominate, returning oxygen to the river at a faster rate than the
bacteria remove it, so the dissolved oxygen begins to climb back to the saturation
value. Figure 16 shows the rate of deoxygenation, the rate of reaeration, and the
oxygen sag curve.
EXAMPLE 8 Streeter-Phelps Oxygen Sag Curve
Just below the point where a continuous discharge of pollution mixes with a river,
the BOD is 10.9 mg/L, and DO is 7.6 mg/L. The river and waste mixture has a
temperature of 20°C, a deoxygenation constant kd of 0.20/day, an average flow
speed of 0.30 m/s, and an average depth of 3.0 m. (In other words, this is just a
continuation of the problem started in Examples 6 and 7.)

a. Find the time and distance downstream at which the oxygen deficit is at a
maximum.
b. Find the minimum value of DO.
Solution From Table 10, the saturation value of DO at 20°C is 9.1 mg/L, so
the initial deficit is

so the minimum value of DO will be the saturation value minus this
maximum deficit:
DOmin = (9.1 - 3.1) mg/L = 6.0 mg/L
In the preceding example, the lowest value of DO was found to be 6.0 mg/L,
an amount sufficient for most aquatic life. If the amount of BOD added to the river
is excessive, the oxygen sag curve may drop below a minimum acceptable level,
leading to a stretch of river with unhealthful conditions, as shown in Figure 17. Fish
that cannot tolerate water with such low oxygen will be driven elsewhere, or they
will die. The variety of animals that can inhabit the unhealthy region is diminished,
and less desirable forms take over, forming thick mats of fungi, filamentous bacteria,
sludge, and blood worms that blanket the bottom. The extreme case of excessive
pollution is one in which the dissolved oxygen is driven to zero, creating a nearly
lifeless, anearobic stretch of river. Decomposition continues at a much slower rate
by anaerobic microbes, releasing noxious and toxic gases such as hydrogen sulfide
and ammonia.
Figure 17 may seem to suggest that the cause of an unhealthful drop in DO is
an increase in the BOD from a waste source. That may be the case, but the oxygen

sag curve is also sensitive to other sorts of changes. The DO curve changes with the
seasons, with the temperature, and with the time of day, even if the pollutant load
is constant. In summer months, for example, river flows are usually diminished, so
the amount of waste dilution decreases, the BOD of the river/waste mix goes up,
and the minimum DO drops.
The effect of temperature on the oxygen sag curve is also important (Figure 18). As temperatures rise, wastes decompose faster, and the rate of deoxygenation increases. At the same time, the saturated value of DO drops, so reaeration
slows down. The combination of these effects causes the critical point downstream
to be reached sooner and the minimum value of DO to be lower as well. Thus, a
stream that may have sufficient DO in colder months may have an unacceptable
deficit in the warmer months of summer. It also illustrates the potential adverse
impact caused by thermal pollution from power plants. A river that might have been
able to accept a certain sewage load without adverse effects could have unacceptably
low oxygen levels when a power plant is added.
Photosynthesis also affects DO. Algae and other aquatic plants add DO during
the daytime hours while photosynthesis is occurring, but at night, their continued
respiration draws it down again. The net effect is a diurnal variation that can lead to
elevated levels of DO in the late afternoon and depressed concentrations at night.
For a lake or a slow-moving stream that is already overloaded with BOD and
choked with algae, it is not unusual for respiration to cause offensive, anaerobic
conditions late at night, even though the river seems fine during the day.
There are other factors not included in our simple oxygen sag model.
Accumulated sludge along the bottom contributes to the oxygen demand; tributaries
contribute their own BOD and DO; multiple sources cause multiple dips in the sag
curve; nonpoint-sources contribute pulses of BOD and other contaminants when
it rains; and this model has not included the effects of nitrification. Nitrification
causes a second dip in the oxygen sag curve a little further downstream as ammonia
and organic nitrogen convert to nitrite and nitrate. If there is not enough DO downstream for nitrification to proceed, nitrogen remains as ammonia, which is toxic.
Modeling the impacts of BOD on the oxygen resources in a stream or river is
an important part of the permitting process for new sources. Stream models can

218

help determine the maximum amount of additional BOD that will be allowed,
which, in turn, affects facility siting decisions and the extent of on-site waste treatment that will be required.

Water Quality in Lakes and Reservoirs
All lakes gradually accumulate silt and organic matter as they undergo a natural
aging process known as eutrophication. A young lake is characterized by a low
nutrient content and low plant productivity. Such oligotrophic (“few foods”) lakes
gradually acquire nutrients from their drainage basins, which enables increased
aquatic growth. Over time, the increased biological productivity causes the water to
become murky with phytoplankton, while decaying organic matter contributes to
the depletion of available dissolved oxygen. The lake becomes eutrophic (“well
fed”). As the accumulating silt and organic debris cause the lake to get shallower
and warmer, more plants take root along the shallow edges, and the lake slowly
transforms into a marsh or bog.
While such eutrophication is a natural process that may take thousands of
years, it is possible to accelerate greatly the rate of change through human activities.
This is called cultural eutrophication. Municipal wastewater, industrial wastes, and
runoff from fertilized agricultural lands add nutrients that stimulate algal growth
and degrade water quality. Algal blooms die and decay, causing unsightly, odorous
clumps of rotting debris along the shoreline and thick mats of dead organic matter
in the lake. The decomposition of dead algae uses up available oxygen, resulting in
the same sort of oxygen depletion problems already mentioned for streams. Among
the first casualties are coldwater fish, whose temperature sensitivity forces them to
stay in the colder bottom waters of a lake where the least amount of oxygen is available. In some lakes, there are periods of time when anaerobic conditions prevail
near the bottom. Not only are organisms at risk for lack of oxygen, but the toxicity
of the water increases as hydrogen sulfide and metals, such as iron and manganese,
which are normally tied up as precipitates in sediments, are dissolved and released
into the lake.
The EPA lake and reservoir assessments mentioned in Section 4 indicate that
half of the U.S. lakes not meeting water quality standards are degraded by eutrophication caused by nutrient enrichment from human activities. As Figure 8 points out
earlier in this chapter, the most common sources of lake and reservoir pollution are
runoff from agricultural and urban nonpoint-sources. Unfortunately, these are the
most difficult sources to control.
Lakes and reservoirs are susceptible to a host of other pollution problems
besides eutrophication. Unlike streams, which can transport pollutants “away,” the
slow dispersal rates in lakes let contamination accumulate quickly, which would
make them seem to be less likely to be used as chemical dumping grounds.
Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case. For example, 78 percent of the
shoreline along the Great Lakes is not meeting the EPA’s criteria for unimpaired beneficial uses because of toxic organic chemical pollution (U.S. EPA, 2002). Lakes and
reservoirs are also vulnerable to effects of sulfuric and nitric acids that are rained
out of the sky.

Water Pollution

Controlling Factors in Eutrophication
Many factors control the rate of production of algae, including the availability of
sunlight to power the photosynthetic reactions, and the concentration of nutrients
required for growth.
The amount of light available is related to the transparency of the water,
which is in turn a function of the level of eutrophication. An oligotrophic lake, such
as Lake Tahoe, may have enough sunlight to allow significant rates of photosynthesis to take place at a depth of 100 m or more, whereas eutrophic lakes may be so
murky that photosynthesis is restricted to a thin layer of water very near the surface.
The top layer of water in a lake, where plants produce more oxygen by photosynthesis than they remove by respiration, is called the euphotic zone. Below that
lies the profundal zone. The transition between the two zones is designated the light
compensation level. The light compensation level corresponds roughly to a depth at
which light intensity is about 1 percent of full sunlight.
While the amount of sunlight available can be a limiting factor in algal
growth, it is not something that we could imagine controlling as a way to slow
eutrophication. The more obvious approach is to try to reduce the supply of nutrients. The list of nutrients that we might consider controlling, however, is long
because it could include every nutrient known to be essential to plant growth. That
list would include carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, iron, manganese, zinc, copper, boron, plus some other essential nutrients. The problem is greatly simplified by focusing on the two that most often limit
algal growth: phosphorus and nitrogen.
Justus Liebig, in 1840, first formulated the idea that “growth of a plant is
dependent on the amount of foodstuff that is presented to it in minimum quantity.”
This has come to be known as Liebig’s law of the minimum. In essence, Liebig’s law
states that algal growth will be limited by the nutrient which is least available relative to its needs. Therefore, the quickest way to control eutrophication would be to
identify the limiting nutrient and reduce its concentration.
Liebig’s law also implies that reductions in a nonlimiting nutrient will not provide effective control unless its concentration can be reduced to the point where it
becomes the limiting nutrient. Thus, for example, reducing phosphorus loading by
eliminating phosphates in detergents will have little effect in a region with nitrogenlimited surface water, but the same reductions could be very effective where phosphorus is the limiting nutrient. As lakes eutrophy, the dominant species of algae are
often blue-green Cyanophyta, which have the unusual characteristic of being able
to obtain their nitrogen directly from the atmosphere. In addition, nitrogen enters
water as “fallout” from combustion sources, particularly fossil-fuel-fired power
plants. With the atmosphere providing a rather unlimited nitrogen supply, most
freshwater systems are phosphorus limited.
To help illustrate the relative amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus that are
required for algal growth, consider the following frequently used representation of
algal photosynthesis (Stumm and Morgan, 1981):
106 CO2 + 16 NO3- + HPO24 - + 122 H2O + 18 H + ¡ C106H263O110N16P + 138 O2

(33)

Using a simple stoichiometric analysis and remembering the atomic weights of
nitrogen (14) and phosphorus (31), the ratio of the mass of nitrogen to phosphorus

220

Water Pollution

in algae is
16 * 14
N
=
= 7.2
P
1 * 31
As a first approximation, then, it takes about 7 times more nitrogen than
phosphorus to produce a given mass of algae. As a rough guideline, when the concentration (mg/L) of nitrogen in water is more than 10 times the concentration of
phosphorus, the body of water will probably be phosphorus limited. When it is less
than 10:1, it will probably be nitrogen limited (Thomann and Mueller, 1987).
Unlike freshwater systems, most marine waters have an N/P ratio less than 5 and are
nitrogen limited.
Sawyer (1947) suggests that phosphorus concentrations in excess of 0.015 mg/L
and nitrogen concentrations above 0.3 mg/L are sufficient to cause blooms of algae.
These are in line with more recent estimates that suggest that 0.010 mg/L phosphorus
is “acceptable,” while 0.020 mg/L is “excessive” (Vollenweider, 1975).

A Simple Phosphorus Model
Suppose we want to estimate the phosphorus concentration that would be expected
in a completely mixed lake under steady state conditions given some combination of
phosphorus sources and sinks. By comparing the calculated phosphorus level with
phosphorus concentrations that are generally considered “acceptable,” we would be
able to estimate the amount of phosphorus control needed to prevent a eutrophication problem. In phosphorus limited lakes, 0.020 mg/L of phosphorus results in
excessive algae blooms, whereas 0.010 mg/L seems to be low enough to prevent
excessive algal production, while 0.020 mg/L is excessive. Following the analysis
presented in Thomann and Mueller (1987), we can model the phosphorus behavior
in an idealized lake by making a number of simplifying assumptions and then
performing a mass balance.
Consider the simple model shown in Figure 19. Phosphorus is shown entering
the lake from a point-source as well as from the incoming stream flow. Phosphorus is
assumed to leave the lake either as part of the exiting stream flow or by settling into
sediments. It would be easy to add other sources, including nonpoint-sources, if their
phosphorus loading rates could be estimated, but that will not be done here.
If we assume equal incoming and outgoing stream flow rates, negligible volumetric flow input from the point-source, a well-mixed lake, and steady state conditions representing a seasonal or annual average, then we can write the following
phosphorus balance:

(35)

The settling rate, ns, is an empirically determined quantity that is difficult to predict
with any confidence. Thomann and Mueller cite studies that suggest settling rates
are around 10 to 16 m/yr.
EXAMPLE 9 Phosphorus Loading in a Lake
A phosphorus limited lake with surface area equal to 80 * 106 m2 is fed by a
15.0 m3/s stream that has a phosphorus concentration of 0.010 mg/L. In addition, effluent from a point-source adds 1 g/s of phosphorus. The phosphorus
settling rate is estimated at 10 m/yr.
a. Estimate the average total phosphorus concentration.
b. What rate of phosphorus removal at the wastewater treatment plant would
be required to keep the concentration of phosphorus in the lake at an
acceptable level of 0.010 mg/L?
Solution
a. The phosphorus loading from the incoming stream is
QCin = 15.0 m3/s * 0.010 mg/L *

222

1 g/m3

= 0.15 g/s

Water Pollution

Adding the 1.0 g/s from the point-source gives a total phosphorus input
rate of 1.15 g/s. The estimated settling rate is
ns =

10 m/yr
= 3.17 * 10 - 7 m/s
365 d/yr * 24 hr/d * 3600 s/hr

Using (35), the steady state concentration of total phosphorus would be
C =

1.15 g/s
QCin + S

3
Q + nsA
15 m /s + 3.17 * 10 - 7 m/s * 80 * 106 m2

= 0.028 g/m3 = 0.028 mg/L
which is above the 0.010 mg/L needed to control eutrophication.
b. To reach 0.010 mg/L, the phosphorus loading from the point-source must be
S = C(Q + nsA) - QCin
= 0.010 g/m3(l5 m3/s + 3.17 * 10 - 7 m/s * 80 * 106 m2)
- 15 m3/s * 0.010 g/m3
= 0.25 g/s
The point-source effluent currently supplies 1.0 g/s, so 75 percent removal
of phosphorus is needed.
This model is based on a number of unrealistic assumptions. For example, due
to a phenomenon called thermal stratification, which will be described in the next
section, the assumption that the lake is well-mixed is usually reasonable only during
certain times of the year and in certain parts of the lake. The assumption of steady
state ignores the dynamic behavior of lakes as weather and seasons change. We have
also assumed that phosphorus is the controlling nutrient and that a simple measure
of its concentration will provide an adequate indication of the potential for eutrophication. Finally, the model assumes a constant phosphorus settling rate that does not
depend on such factors as the fraction of incoming phosphorus that is in particulate
form, the movement of phosphorus both to sediments and from sediments, and
physical parameters of the lake such as the ratio of lake volume to stream flow (the
hydraulic detention time). Despite these unrealistic assumptions, the model has been
shown in practice to produce very useful results (Thomann and Mueller, 1987).

Thermal Stratification
As we have seen, nutrients stimulate algal growth and the subsequent death and
decay of that algae can lead to oxygen depletion. This oxygen depletion problem is
worsened by certain physical characteristics of lakes, which we will now consider.
As mentioned earlier, one of the most unusual properties of water is the fact
that its density does not monotonically increase as the temperature drops. Instead, it
has a maximum point at 4°C, as shown in Figure 20. One result of this density maximum is that ice floats because the water surrounding it is slightly warmer and
denser. If water were like other liquids, ice would sink, and it would be possible for
lakes to freeze solid from the bottom up. Fortunately, this is not the case.

temperature profiles.

Above 4°C, the density of water decreases with temperature. As a result, a lake
warmed by the sun during the summer will tend to have a layer of warm water floating on the top of the denser, colder water below. Conversely, in the winter, if the lake’s
surface drops below 4°C, it will create a layer of cold water that floats on top of the
more dense, 4°C water below. These density differences between surface water and
the water nearer to the bottom inhibit vertical mixing in the lake, causing a very
stable layering effect known as thermal stratification.
Figure 21 shows the stratification that typically occurs in a deep lake, in the
temperate zone, during the summer. In the upper layer, known as the epilimnion, the
warm water is completely mixed by the action of wind and waves, causing an
almost uniform temperature profile. The thickness of the epilimnion varies from
lake to lake and from month to month. In a small lake, it may be only a meter or so
deep, whereas in large lakes, it may extend down 20 m or more. Below the epilimnion is a transition layer called the thermocline, or metalimnion, in which the temperature drops rather quickly. Most swimmers have experienced a thermocline’s
sudden drop in temperature when diving down into a lake. Below the thermocline is
a region of cold water called the hypolimnion.
In terms of mixing, summer stratification creates essentially two separate
lakes—a warm lake (epilimnion) floating on top of a cold lake (hypolimnion). The
separation is quite stable and becomes increasingly so as the summer progresses.
Once summer stratification begins, the lack of mixing between the layers causes the
epilimnion, which is absorbing solar energy, to warm even faster, creating an even
greater density difference. This difference is enhanced in a eutrophic lake since in such
lakes most, if not all, of the absorption of solar energy occurs in the epilimnion.

224

Water Pollution

As the seasons progress and winter approaches, the temperature of the epilimnion begins to drop, and the marked stratification of summer begins to disappear.
Sometime in the fall, perhaps along with a passing storm that stirs things up, the
stratification will disappear, the temperature will become uniform with depth, and
complete mixing of the lake becomes possible. This is called the fall overturn.
Similarly, in climates that are cold enough for the surface to drop below 4°C, there
will be a winter stratification, followed by a spring overturn when the surface
warms up enough to allow complete mixing once again.

Stratification and Dissolved Oxygen
Dissolved oxygen, one of the most important water quality parameters, is greatly
affected by both eutrophication and thermal stratification. Consider, for example,
two different stratified lakes, one oligotrophic and one eutrophic. In both lakes, the
waters of the epilimnion can be expected to be rich in DO since oxygen is readily
available from reaeration and photosynthesis. The hypolimnion, on the other hand,
is cut off from the oxygen-rich epilimnion by stratification. The only source of new
oxygen in the hypolimnion will be photosynthesis, but that will only happen if the
water is clear enough to allow the euphotic zone to extend below the thermocline.
That is, the hypolimnion of a clear, oligotrophic lake at least has the possibility of
having a source of oxygen while that of a murky eutrophic lake does not.
In addition, the eutrophic lake is rich in nutrients and organic matter. Algal
blooms suddenly appear and die off, leaving rotting algae that washes onto the
beaches or sinks to the bottom. The rain of organic debris into the hypolimnion
leads to increased oxygen demand there. Thus, not only is there inherently less oxygen available in the hypolimnion, but there is also more demand for oxygen due to
decomposition, especially if the lake is eutrophic. Once summer stratification sets in,
DO in the hypolimnion will begin dropping, driving fish out of the colder bottom
regions of the lake and into the warmer, more oxygen-rich surface waters. As lakes
eutrophy, fish that require cold water for survival are the first to die. In the extreme
case, the hypolimnion of a eutrophic lake can become anaerobic during the summer,
as is suggested in Figure 22.
During the fall and spring overturns, which may last for several weeks, the
lake’s waters become completely mixed. Nutrients from the bottom are distributed
throughout the lake and oxygen from the epilimnion becomes mixed with the
oxygen-poor hypolimnion. The lake, in essence, takes a deep breath of air.

Water Pollution

In winter, demands for oxygen decrease as metabolic rates decrease, while at
the same time, the ability of water to hold oxygen increases. Thus, even though
winter stratification may occur, its effects tend not to be as severe as those in the
summer. If ice forms, however, both reaeration and photosynthesis may cease to
provide oxygen, and fish may die.
Tropical lakes may remain stratified indefinitely since they do not experience
the degree of seasonal variation that allows lakes to overturn. When a tropical lake
eutrophies, the hypolimnion goes anaerobic and tends to stay that way. Decomposition in the hypolimnion produces gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methane
(CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2), which tend to remain dissolved in the bottom
waters, especially if the lake is deep and bottom pressure is high. In volcanically
formed crater lakes, underground springs of carbonated groundwater can also contribute CO2 to the hypolimnion. When lake bottoms become saturated with these
dissolved gases, there is danger that some event, such as an earthquake or landslide,
can trigger a sudden and dangerous gas bubble to erupt from the surface. Such an
event occurred in Lake Monoun in Cameroon, Africa, in 1984, and another gaseous
eruption occurred in Lake Nyos, Cameroon, two years later. Each eruption belched
a cloud of heavier-than-air carbon dioxide that hugged the ground, rolled into
valleys, and, by displacing oxygen, asphyxiated farm animals and people. The Lake
Monoun event killed 37 people, and the Lake Nyos event killed more than 1,700
people, some as far away as 25 km (Monastersky, 1994). The bubble of CO2 emerging from Lake Nyos is said to have created a toxic fountain that shot 150 m into the
air. Both events occurred in August, the coolest and rainiest time of the year, when
thermal stratification is the least stable.

Acidification of Lakes
All rainfall is naturally somewhat acidic. As was demonstrated, pure water in equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide forms a weak solution of carbonic acid
(H2CO3) with a pH of about 5.6. As a result, only rainfall with pH less than 5.6 is
considered to be “acid rain.” It is not unusual for rainfall in the northeastern United
States to have pH between 4.0 and 5.0, and for acid fogs in southern California to
have pH less than 3.0. There is little question that such pH values are caused by anthropogenic emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides formed during the combustion
of fossil fuels. Since some sulfur oxides are actually particles that can settle out of
the atmosphere without precipitation, the popular expression “acid rain” is more
correctly described as acid deposition.
The effects of acid deposition on materials, terrestrial ecosystems, and aquatic
ecosystems are still only partially understood, but some features are emerging quite
clearly. Acids degrade building materials, especially limestone, marble (a form of limestone), various commonly used metals such as galvanized steel, and certain paints. In
fact, the increased rate of weathering and erosion of building surfaces and monuments
was one of the first indications of adverse impacts from acid rain. Terrestrial ecosystems, especially forests, seem to be experiencing considerable stress due to acid deposition, with reductions in growth and increased mortality being especially severe in
portions of the eastern United States, eastern Canada, and northern Europe. It is the
impact of acidification on aquatic ecosystems, however, that will be described here.

226

Water Pollution

Bicarbonate Buffering
Aquatic organisms are very sensitive to pH. Most are severely stressed if pH drops
below 5.5, and very few are able to survive when pH falls below 5.0. Moreover, as
pH drops, certain toxic minerals, such as aluminum, lead, and mercury, which are
normally insoluble and hence relatively harmless, enter solution and can be lethal to
fish and other organisms.
It is important to note, however, that adding acid to a solution may have little
or no effect on pH, depending on whether or not the solution has buffers. Buffers
are substances capable of neutralizing added hydrogen ions. The available buffering
of an aquatic ecosystem is not only a function of the chemical characteristics of the
lake itself, but also of nearby soils through which water percolates as it travels from
the land to the lake. Thus, information on the pH of precipitation alone, without
taking into account the chemical characteristics of the receiving body of water
and surrounding soils, is a poor indicator of the potential effect of acid rain on an
aquatic ecosystem.
Most lakes are buffered by bicarbonate (HCO3- ), which is related to carbonic
acid (H2CO3) by the following reaction:
H2CO3
Carbonic acid

¡
— H + + HCO3-

(36)

Bicarbonate

Some bicarbonate results from the dissociation of carbonic acid, as is suggested in (36), and some comes from soils. Consider what happens to a lake containing
bicarbonate when hydrogen ions (acid) are added. As reaction (36) suggests, some
of the added hydrogen ions will react with bicarbonate to form neutral carbonic
acid. To the extent that this occurs, the addition of hydrogen ions does not show up
as an increase in hydrogen ion concentration, so the pH may only change slightly.
That is, bicarbonate is a buffer.
Notice that the reaction of hydrogen ions with bicarbonate removes bicarbonate from solution so, unless there is a source of new bicarbonate, its concentration
will decrease as more acid is added. At some point, there may be so little bicarbonate left that relatively small additional inputs of acid will cause pH to decrease
rapidly. This phenomenon leads to one way to classify lakes in terms of their acidification. As shown in Figure 23, a bicarbonate lake shows little decrease in pH as hydrogen ions are added, until the pH drops to about 6.3. As pH drops below this
point, the bicarbonate buffering is rapidly depleted, and the lake enters a transitional phase. As shown in the figure, transitional lakes with pH between about 5.0
and 6.0 are very sensitive to small changes in acid. Below pH 5.0, the lakes are
unbuffered and chronically acidic (Wright, 1984).
The implications of Figure 23 are worth repeating. Acid precipitation may
have little or no effect on a lake’s pH up until the point where the natural buffering
is exhausted. During that stage, there may be no evidence of harm to aquatic life,
and the lake may appear to be perfectly healthy. Continued exposure to acidification
beyond that point, however, can result in a rapid drop in pH that can be disastrous
to the ecosystem.
In a Norwegian study, 684 lakes were categorized by their water chemistry
into bicarbonate lakes, transition lakes, and acid lakes, and for each category,
observations of fish populations were made (Henriksen, 1980; Wright, 1984). Four

lake acidification.

Importance of the Local Watershed
If there is a source of bicarbonate to replace that which is removed during acidification, then the buffering ability of bicarbonate can be extensive. Consider the ability

As this pair of reactions suggests, limestone reacts with acids (hydrogen ions) to
form bicarbonate, and the bicarbonate neutralizes even more hydrogen ions as it
converts eventually to carbon dioxide. These reactions show why limestone is an effective buffer to acidification. They also show why limestone and marble monuments and building facades are deteriorating under the attack of acid deposition.
The bicarbonate that is formed in (37) can replenish the lake’s natural bicarbonate buffers. Calcareous lakes, which have an abundance of calcium carbonate, are
thus invulnerable to acidification. Copying this natural phenomenon, one way to temporarily mitigate the effects of acidification is to artificially treat vulnerable lakes with
limestone (CaCO3). This approach is being vigorously pursued in a number of countries that are most impacted by acid rain, including Sweden, Norway, Canada, and the
United States (Shepard, 1986).
The ability of nearby soils to buffer acid deposition is an extremely important
determinant of whether or not a lake will be subject to acidification. Soil systems
derived from calcareous (limestone) rock, for example, are better able to assimilate
acid deposition than soils derived from granite bedrock. The depth and permeability
of soils are also important characteristics. Thin, relatively impermeable soils provide
little contact between soil and runoff, which reduces the ability of natural soil
buffers to affect acidity. The size and shape of the watershed itself also affect a lake’s
vulnerability. Steep slopes and a small watershed create conditions in which the
runoff has little time to interact with soil buffers, increasing the likelihood of lake
acidification. Even the type of vegetation growing in the watershed can affect acidification. Rainwater that falls through a forest canopy interacts with natural materials in the trees, such as sap, and its pH is affected. Deciduous foliage tends to
decrease acidity, while water dripping from evergreen foliage tends to be more acidic
than the rain itself.
In other words, to a large extent, the characteristics of the watershed itself will
determine the vulnerability of a lake to acid. The most vulnerable lakes will be in
areas with shallow soil of low permeability, granite bedrock, a steep watershed, and
a predominance of conifers. Using factors such as these enables scientists to predict
areas where lakes are potentially most sensitive to acid rain. One such prediction,
using bedrock geology as the criterion, produced the map shown in Figure 25a.
Figure 25b shows the average pH of rainfall across North America. Large areas in
the northeastern portion of the continent, especially those near the Canadian border,
have the unfortunate combination of vulnerable soils and very acidic precipitation.

Groundwater
Groundwater is the source of about one-third of this country’s drinking water, and,
excluding water for power plant cooling, it supplies almost 40 percent of our total
water withdrawals. In rural areas, almost all of the water supply comes from groundwater, and more than one-third of our 100 largest cities depend on groundwater for at
least part of their supply. Historically, the natural filtering resulting from water working its way through the subsurface was believed to provide sufficient protection from
contamination to allow untreated groundwater to be delivered to customers. Then
Love Canal, New York, and other dramatic incidents in the 1970s made us realize
that groundwater was contaminated with hazardous substances from hundreds of

thousands of leaking underground storage tanks, industrial waste pits, home septic
systems, municipal and industrial landfills, accidental chemical spills, careless use of
solvents, illegal “midnight” dumping, and widespread use of agricultural chemicals.
Groundwater contamination became the environmental issue of the 1980s.
In response to growing pressure to do something about hazardous wastes,
Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act (CERCLA, but more commonly known as Superfund) in 1980 to deal
with already contaminated sites. In 1980 and 1984, Congress strengthened the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which controls the manufacturing, transportation, and disposal of newly produced hazardous substances. These
two acts, one cleaning up problems of the past, and one helping avoid problems in
the future, have had a major impact. The billions of dollars that have been spent
attempting to clean up contaminated soil and groundwater, along with the very high
costs of handling and disposing of new hazardous wastes, have stimulated interest in
pollution prevention as the environmental theme of the future.
Once contaminated, groundwater is difficult, if not impossible, to restore. A
recent study by the National Research Council (1994) estimates that there are
between 300,000 and 400,000 sites in the United States that may have contaminated soil or groundwater requiring some form of remediation. The bulk of these
sites are leaking underground storage tanks. These sites have been costing around
$100,000 each to clean up; more complex sites are costing an average of $27 million
each (U.S. EPA, 1993). To clean up all of these sites, the estimated cost would be
between $480 billion and $1 trillion (NRC, 1994). These enormous costs have
called into question the goal of cleaning up such sites to drinking water quality,
especially if the groundwater is unlikely to ever be needed for such purposes.

Aquifers
Rainfall and snow melt can flow into rivers and streams, return to the atmosphere by
evaporation or transpiration, or seep into the ground to become part of the subsurface, or underground, water. As water percolates down through cracks and pores of
soil and rock, it passes through a region called the unsaturated zone, which is characterized by the presence of both air and water in the spaces between soil particles.
Water in the unsaturated zone, called vadose water, is essentially unavailable for
human use. That is, it cannot be pumped, although plants certainly use soil water that
lies near the surface. In the saturated zone, all spaces between soil particles are filled
with water. Water in the saturated zone is called groundwater, and the upper boundary of the saturated zone is called the water table. There is a transition region
between these two zones called the capillary fringe, where water rises into small
cracks as a result of the attraction between water and rock surfaces. Figure 26 illustrates these regions of the subsurface.
An aquifer is a saturated geologic layer that is permeable enough to allow
water to flow fairly easily through it. An aquifer sits on top of a confining bed or, as
it is sometimes called, an aquitard or an aquiclude, which is a relatively impermeable
layer that greatly restricts the movement of groundwater. The two terms, aquifer and
confining bed, are not precisely defined and are often used in a relative sense.

The illustration in Figure 26 shows an unconfined aquifer. A water table well
drilled into the saturated zone of such an aquifer will have water at atmospheric
pressure at the level of the water table. Groundwater also occurs in confined
aquifers, which are aquifers sandwiched between two confining layers, as shown in
Figure 27. Water in a confined aquifer can be under pressure so that a well drilled
into it will have water naturally rising above the upper surface of the confined
aquifer, in which case the well is called an artesian well. A line drawn at the level to
which water would rise in an artesian well defines a surface called the piezometric
surface or the potentiometic surface. In some circumstances, enough pressure may
exist in a confined aquifer to cause water in a well to rise above the ground level and
flow without pumping. Such a well is called a flowing artesian well. Also shown in
Figure 27 is a local impermeable layer in the midst of an unsaturated zone, above

the main body of groundwater. Downward percolating water is trapped above this
layer, creating a perched water table.
The amount of water that can be stored in a saturated aquifer depends on the
porosity of the soil or rock that makes up the aquifer. Porosity (h) is defined to be
the ratio of the volume of voids (openings) to the total volume of material:
Porosity (h) =

Volume of voids
Total volume of solids and voids

(39)

While porosity describes the water-bearing capacity of a geologic formation, it is not
a good indicator of the total amount of water that can be removed from that formation. Some water will always be retained as a film on rock surfaces and in very small
cracks and openings. The volume of water that can actually be drained from an
unconfined aquifer per unit of area per unit decline in the water table is called the
specific yield, or the effective porosity. Representative values of porosity and specific
yield for selected materials are given in Table 11. For confined aquifers, the estimated yield is somewhat affected by the pressure released as water is removed, so a different term, the storage coefficient, is used to describe the yield.

EXAMPLE 10 Specific yield
For an aquifer of sand, having characteristics given in Table 11, what volume of
water would be stored in a saturated column with a cross-sectional area equal to
1.0 m2 and a depth of 2.0 m? How much water could be extracted from that
volume?
Solution The volume of material is 1.0 m2 * 2.0 m = 2.0 m3, so the volume
of water stored would be
Volume of water = Porosity * Volume of material
= 0.34 * 2.0 m3 = 0.68 m3
The amount that could actually be removed would be
Yield = Specific yield * Volume of material = 0.25 * 2.0 m3 = 0.5 m3

Hydraulic Gradient
In an unconfined aquifer, the slope of the water table, measured in the direction of
the steepest rate of change, is called the hydraulic gradient. It is important because
groundwater flow is in the direction of the gradient and at a rate proportional to
the gradient. To define it more carefully, we need to introduce the notion of the
hydraulic head. As shown in Figure 28, the hydraulic head is the vertical distance
from some reference datum plane (usually taken to be sea level) to the water table. It
has dimensions of length, such as “meters of water” or “feet of water.” If we imagine two wells directly in line with the groundwater flow, the gradient would be simply the difference in head divided by the horizontal distance between them. In an
analogous way, the gradient for a confined aquifer is the slope of the piezometric
surface along the direction of maximum rate of change.
If the flow in Figure 28 is from left to right in the plane of the page, the gradient would be
Hydraulic gradient =

Notice that the gradient is dimensionless as long as numerator and denominator
both use the same units. In a microscopic sense, gradient can be expressed as
Hydraulic gradient =

(41)

If we imagine looking down onto the groundwater flow of Figure 28, we could
imagine streamlines showing the direction of flow, and equipotential lines, perpendicular to the streamlines, which represent locations with equal head. The combination
of streamlines and equipotential lines creates a two-dimensional flow net, as shown

in Figure 29. If we happened to have two wells aligned along a streamline as shown
in Figure 29, the gradient would be simply the difference in head divided by the distance between equipotentials.
Figure 29 represents the special case of two wells along the same streamline. In
the more general case, it is possible to estimate the gradient using measurements
made at three wells using the following simple graphical procedure (Heath, 1983):
Begin by finding the locations and hydraulic heads for three nearby wells, as shown
in Figure 30. Then, follow these steps:
1. Draw a line between the two wells with the highest and lowest head and
divide that line into equal intervals. Identify the location on the line where
the head is equal to the head of the third (intermediate head) well.
2. Draw a line between the intermediate-head well and the spot on the line
drawn in step 1 that corresponds to the head of the intermediate well. This is
an equipotential line, meaning that the head anywhere along the line should
be approximately constant. Groundwater flow will be in a direction perpendicular to this line.
3. Draw a line perpendicular to the equipotential line through the well with the
lowest (or the highest) head. This is a flow line, which means groundwater
flow is in a direction parallel to this line.
4. Determine the gradient as the difference in head between the head on the
equipotential and the head at the lowest (or highest) well, divided by the distance from the equipotential line to that well.

EXAMPLE 11 Estimating the Hydraulic Gradient from Three Wells
Two wells are drilled 200 m apart along an east-west axis. The west well has a
total head of 30.2 meters, and the east well has a 30.0 m head. A third well
located 100 m due south of the east well has a total head of 30.1 m. Find the
magnitude and direction of the hydraulic gradient.
Solution The locations of the wells are shown in Figure 31a. In Figure 31b, a
line has been drawn between the wells with the highest (west, 30.2 m) and lowest
(east, 30.0 m) head, and the location along that line with head equal to the intermediate well (south, 30.1 m) has been indicated. The line corresponding to a
30.1-m equipotential has been drawn.
In Figure 31c, streamlines perpendicular to the equipotential line have been
drawn toward the east well. The direction of the gradient is thus at a 45° angle
from the southwest. The distance between the equipotential and the east well is
easily determined by geometry to be L = 100> 22. So the gradient is
Hydraulic gradient =

(30.1 - 30.0) m
(100> 22) m

= 0.00141

Darcy’s Law
The basic equation governing groundwater flow was first formulated by the French
hydraulic engineer Henri Darcy in 1856. Based on laboratory experiments in which
he studied the flow of water through sand filters, Darcy concluded that flow rate Q
is proportional to the cross sectional area A times the hydraulic gradient (dh>dL):
Q = KAa

= the hydraulic gradient

Equation (42) is known as Darcy’s law for flow through porous media.
Darcy’s law assumes linearity between flow rate and hydraulic gradient, which is a
valid assumption in most, but not all, circumstances. It breaks down when flow is
turbulent, which may occur in the immediate vicinity of a pumped well. It is also
invalid when water flows through extremely fine-grained materials, such as colloidal clays, and it should only be used when the medium is fully saturated with
water. It also depends on temperature. Some approximate values of the constant of
proportionality K are given Table 12. It should be appreciated, however, that these
values for the hydraulic conductivity are very rough. Conductivities can easily vary
over several orders of magnitude for any given category of material, depending on
differences in particle orientation and shape as well as relative amounts of silt and
clay that might be present.
Aquifers that have the same hydraulic conductivity throughout are said to be
homogeneous, whereas those in which hydraulic conductivity differs from place to
place are heterogeneous. Not only may hydraulic conductivity vary from place to
place within the aquifer, but it may also depend on the direction of flow. It is common, for example, to have higher hydraulic conductivities in the horizontal direction than in the vertical. Aquifers that have the same hydraulic conductivity in any

flow direction are said to be isotropic, whereas those in which conductivity depends
on direction are anisotropic. Although it is mathematically convenient to assume
that aquifers are both homogeneous and isotropic, they rarely, if ever, are.
EXAMPLE 12 Flow Through an Aquifer
A confined aquifer 20.0 m thick has two monitoring wells spaced 500 m apart
along the direction of groundwater flow. The difference in water level in the wells is
2.0 m (the difference in piezometric head). The hydraulic conductivity is 50 m/day.

Flow Velocity
It is often important to estimate the rate at which groundwater is moving through an
aquifer, especially when a toxic plume exists upgradient from a water supply well. If we
combine the usual relationship between flow rate, velocity, and cross-sectional area,

for water to flow through. Since much of the cross-sectional area is made up of solids,
the actual area through which all of the flow takes place is much smaller, and as a
result, the real groundwater velocity is considerably faster than the Darcy velocity.
As suggested in Figure 33, consider the cross-section of an aquifer to be made
up of voids and solids, with A representing the total cross-sectional area and A¿
being the area of voids filled with water. Letting n¿ be the actual average linear velocity (sometimes called the seepage velocity), we can rewrite (44) as

EXAMPLE 13 A Groundwater Plume
Suppose the aquifer in Example 12 has become contaminated upgradient of the
two wells. Consider the upgradient well as a monitoring well whose purpose is to
provide early detection of the approaching plume to help protect the second,
drinking water well. How long after the monitoring well is contaminated would
you expect the drinking water well to be contaminated? Make the following three
assumptions (each of which will be challenged later):
1. Ignore dispersion or diffusion of the plume (that is, it does not spread out).
2. Assume the plume moves at the same speed as the groundwater.
3. Ignore the “pulling” effect of the drinking water well.
The aquifer has a porosity of 35 percent.

239

Water Pollution

Solution

The Darcy velocity is given by (44):
Darcy velocity n = K

dh
= 50 m/d * 0.004 = 0.20 m/d
dL

The average linear velocity is the Darcy velocity divided by porosity:
Average linear velocity n¿ =

0.20 m/d
= 0.57 m/d
0.35

so the time to travel the 500-m distance would be
t =

500 m
= 877 days = 2.4 yr
0.57 m/d

As this example illustrates, groundwater moves very slowly.

12

Contaminant Transport
A few comments on the assumptions made in Example 13 are in order. The first assumption was that there would be no dispersion or diffusion, so the contamination
would move forward with a sharp front, the so-called plug flow case. The second
was that the plume moves at the same speed as the groundwater flow. The third was
that the drinking water well did not pull the plume toward it, which would make the
plume speed up as it approached the well. In reality, all three of these assumptions
need to be examined.

Dispersion and Diffusion
When there is a difference in concentration of a solute in groundwater, molecular
diffusion will tend to cause movement from regions of high concentration to regions
where the concentration is lower. That is, even in the absence of groundwater movement, a blob of contaminant will tend to diffuse in all directions, blurring the
boundary between it and the surrounding groundwater. A second process that
causes a contaminant plume to spread out is dispersion. Since a contaminant plume
follows irregular pathways as it moves, some finding large pore spaces in which it
can move quickly, while other portions of the plume have to force their way through
more confining voids, there will be a difference in speed of an advancing plume
that tends to cause the plume to spread out. Since diffusion and dispersion both tend
to smear the edges of the plume, they are sometimes linked together and simply
referred to as hydrodynamic dispersion.
Since contamination spreads out as it moves, it does not arrive all at once at a
given location downgradient. This effect is easily demonstrated in the laboratory by
establishing a steady state flow regime in a column packed with a homogeneous
granular material and then introducing a continuous stream of a nonreactive tracer,
as shown in Figure 34a. If the tracer had no dispersion, a plot of concentration versus the time that it takes to leave the column would show a sharp jump. Instead, the
front arrives smeared out, as shown in Figure 34b.

While the column experiment described in Figure 34 illustrates longitudinal
dispersion, there is also some dispersion normal to the main flow. Figure 35 shows
what might be expected if an instantaneous (pulse) source of contaminant is injected
into a flowfield, such as might occur with an accidental spill that contaminates
groundwater. As the plume moves downgradient, dispersion causes the plume to
spread in the longitudinal as well as orthogonal directions.

241

Water Pollution

Retardation
A second assumption used in Example 13 was that the contaminants would move at
the same speed as the groundwater, which may or may not be the case in reality. As
contaminants move through an aquifer, some are absorbed by solids along the way,
and some are adsorbed (that is, adhered to the surface of particles). The general term
sorption applies to both processes. The ratio of total contaminant in a unit volume of
aquifer to the contaminant dissolved in groundwater is called the retardation factor.
For example, the retardation factor for chloride ions is 1, which means all of it is dissolved in groundwater. A retardation factor of 5 for some other contaminant means
20 percent is dissolved in groundwater, and 80 percent is sorbed to the aquifer solids.
When the amount sorbed reaches equilibrium in the aquifer, the retardation
factor takes on a more intuitive meaning. It is the ratio of the average velocity of
groundwater n¿ to the velocity of the sorbed material, ns:
Retardation factor = R =

Average groundwater velocity, n¿
Velocity of the sorbed material, ns

Ú 1

(49)

So, for example, a retardation factor of 5 means the groundwater travels five times
as far in a given period of time as does the contaminant.
Figure 36 illustrates the impact of sorption on the time required for a pulse of
contaminant to make its way to a monitoring well. A nonsorbing compound shows
modest dispersion and emerges rather quickly. When a substance sorbs at a rate proportional to its concentration, it is said to exhibit linear sorption, and such compounds show retardation, but as shown in the figure, the pulse maintains its

symmetrical shape. For nonlinear sorption, a long tail is shown, suggesting that
much larger volumes of water will be required to flush the system.
It is relatively straightforward to perform retardation experiments in the laboratory, producing results such as are shown in Figure 36. In an actual aquifer, however, retardation experiments are much more difficult. In one such in situ
experiment (Roberts, Goltz, and Mackay, 1986), a number of organic solutes, including carbon tetrachloride (CTET) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE), were injected
into the groundwater, along with a chloride tracer, which is assumed to move at the
same rate as the groundwater itself. The position of the three plumes roughly 21
months later, as indicated by two-dimensional contours of depth-averaged concentrations, is shown in Figure 37. As can be seen, the center of the chloride plume has
moved roughly 60 m away from the point of injection (x = 0, y = 0), the CTET has
moved about 25 m, and the PCE has moved only a bit over 10 m.
Using actual plume measurements such as are shown in Figure 37, Roberts
et al. (1986) determined retardation factors for CTET and PCE, as well as for bromoform (BROM), dichlorobenzene (DCB), and hexachlorethane (HCE). As shown in

Figure 38, retardation factors are not constants but instead appear to increase over
time and eventually reach a steady state value.
In a conventional pump-and-treat system for groundwater cleanup, retardation can greatly increase the cost of the system, since pumping must continue for a
longer period of time. Figure 39 shows an estimate of the operating cost of such a
system as a function of retardation.

Cone of Depression
Another assumption made in Example 13 was that pumping water from the aquifer
would not affect the hydraulic gradient. That is, in fact, not the case, since there
must be a gradient toward the well to provide flow to the well. Moreover, the faster
the well is pumped, the steeper the gradient will be in the vicinity of the well. When
a well is pumped, the water table in an unconfined aquifer, or the piezometric surface for a confined aquifer, forms a cone of depression in the vicinity of the well such
as is shown in Figure 40.
If we make enough simplifying assumptions, we can use Darcy’s law to derive
an expression for the shape of the cone of depression, as follows. We will assume
that pumping has been steady for a long enough time that the shape of the cone is no
longer changing; that is, we assume equilibrium conditions. In addition, we will
assume that the original water table is horizontal. If we also assume that the drawdown is small relative to the depth of the aquifer and that the well draws from the
entire depth of the aquifer, then the flow to the well is horizontal and radial. Under
these conditions, and using Figures 40 and 41, we can write Darcy’s law for flow

where the cross-sectional area of an imaginary cylinder around the well is 2prhc, K

The flow through the cylinder toward the well equals the rate at which water is
being pumped from the well, Q. It’s important to recognize the subtle distinction
between hc that appears in (50) and the hydraulic head, h, that first appears in (40)
and Figure 28. The hydraulic head, h, is measured from any suitable horizontal
datum such as sea level, whereas hc is the height of the water table above the confining layer at the bottom of the aquifer. (In other words, hc is the depth of an unconfined aquifer at a distance r from the well.)

(53)

Equation (53), for an unconfined aquifer, can be used in several ways. It can be
used to estimate the shape of the cone of depression for a given pumping rate, or it
can be rearranged and used to determine the aquifer hydraulic conductivity K. To
estimate K, two observation wells capable of measuring heads hc,2 and hc,1 are set up
at distances r2 and r1 from a well pumping at a known rate Q. The data obtained
can then be used in (53), as the following example illustrates. Actually, since equilibrium conditions take fairly long to be established, and since more information about
the characteristics of the aquifer can be obtained with a transient study, this method
of obtaining K is not commonly used. A similar, but more complex, model based on
a transient analysis of the cone of depression is used (see, for example, Freeze and
Cherry, 1979).

EXAMPLE 14 Determining K from the Cone of Depression
Suppose a well 0.30 m in diameter has been pumped at a rate of 6,000 m3/day for
a long enough time that steady-state conditions apply. An observation well
located 30 m from the pumped well has been drawn down by 1.0 m, and another
well at 100 m is drawn down by 0.50 m. The well extends completely through an
unconfined aquifer 30.0 m thick.

= 78.6 m/d

b. To estimate the drawdown, let r = rw = 0.30>2 = 0.15 m, and let us use
the first observation well for r1 = 30 m and hc,1 = 29 m. Using (55) to find
the head at the outer edge of the well hw gives
Q =

pK(h2c,1 - h2w)
ln(r1 >rw)

=

p(78.6 m/d)(29.02 - h2w) m2
= 6,000 m3/d
ln(30.0>0.15)

Solving for hw yields
hw = 26.7 m
so the drawdown would be 30.0 - 26.7 = 3.3 m
Equation (53) was derived for an unconfined aquifer. The derivation for a
confined aquifer is similar, but now the height of the cylinder at radius r, through
which water flows to reach the well, is a constant equal to the thickness of the

Capture-Zone Curves
The most common way to begin the cleanup of contaminated groundwater is to
install extraction wells. As an extraction well pumps water from the contaminated
aquifer, the water table (or piezometric surface, if it is a confined aquifer) in the vicinity of the well is lowered, creating a hydraulic gradient that draws the plume toward
the well. With properly located extraction wells, the polluted groundwater can be
pumped out of the aquifer, cleaned in an above-ground treatment facility, and used or
returned to the aquifer. The process is referred to as pump-and-treat technology.
Figure 44 shows the effect of an extraction well located in a region with a uniform and steady regional groundwater flow that is parallel to and in the direction of
the negative x-axis. As water is extracted, the natural streamlines are bent toward
the well as shown in the figure. The outer envelope of the streamlines that converge
on the well is called the capture-zone curve. Groundwater inside the capture zone is
extracted; water outside the capture zone is not. Flow lines outside of the capture

zone may curve toward the well, but the regional flow associated with the natural
hydraulic gradient is strong enough to carry that groundwater past the well.
Javandel and Tsang (1986) developed the use of capture-zone type curves as an
aid to the design of extraction well fields for aquifer cleanup. Their analysis is based
on an assumed ideal aquifer (that is, one that is homogeneous, isotropic, uniform in
cross-section, and infinite in width). Also, it is either confined or unconfined with an
insignificant drawdown relative to the total thickness of the aquifer. They assume
extraction wells that extend downward through the entire thickness of the aquifer
and are screened to extract uniformly from every level. These are very restrictive
assumptions that are unlikely ever to be satisfied in any real situation; nonetheless,
the resulting analysis does give considerable insight into the main factors that affect
more realistic, but complex, models.
For a single extraction well located at the origin of the coordinate system
shown in Figure 44, Javandel and Tsang derive the following relationship between
the x and y coordinates of the envelope surrounding the capture zone:

where

(58)

Equation (58) makes it easy to predict some important measures of the capture
zone. For example, as x approaches infinity, f = 0, and y = Q>(2Bn), which sets
the maximum total width of the capture zone as 2[Q>(2Bn)] = Q>Bn. For
f = p>2, x = 0 and y becomes equal to Q>(4Bn). Thus, the width of the capture
zone along the y-axis is Q>(2Bn), which is only half as broad as it is far from the
well. These relationships are illustrated in Figure 45.
The width of the capture zone is directly proportional to the pumping rate Q
and inversely proportional to the product of the regional (without the effect of the
well) Darcy flow velocity n and the aquifer thickness B. Higher regional flow velocities therefore require higher pumping rates to capture the same area of plume.
Usually there will be some maximum pumping rate determined by the acceptable
amount of drawdown at the well that restricts the size of the capture zone.
Assuming that the aquifer characteristics have been determined and the plume
boundaries defined, one way to use capture-zone type curves is first to draw the
curve corresponding to the maximum acceptable pumping rate. Then by superimposing the plume onto the capture zone curve (drawn to the same scale), it can be
determined whether or not a single well will be sufficient to extract the entire plume
and, if it is, where the well can be located. Figure 46 suggests the approach, and the
following example illustrates its use for a very idealized plume.

EXAMPLE 15 A Single Extraction Well
Consider a confined aquifer having thickness 20 m, hydraulic conductivity
1.0 * 10 - 3 m/s, and a regional hydraulic gradient equal to 0.002. The maximum
pumping rate has been determined to be 0.004 m3/s. The aquifer has been contaminated and, for simplicity, consider the plume to be rectangular, with width
80 m. Locate a single extraction well so that it can totally remove the plume.

Solution

Let us first determine the regional Darcy velocity:
n = K

Now find the critical dimensions of the capture zone. Along the y-axis, its width is

2Bn
2 * 20 m * 2.0 * 10 - 6 m/s
and, at an infinite distance upgradient, the width of the capture zone is
Q

Bn
So the 80-m-wide plume will fit within the capture zone if the well is located
some distance downgradient from the front edge. Using Figure 47 as a guide, we
can determine the distance x that must separate the plume from the well. From

so the angle, in radians to the point where the plume just touches the capture
zone, is
f = 0.2p rad
and, from Figure 47,
x =

=

The extraction well should be placed 55 m ahead of the oncoming plume and
directly in line with it.
The single-well solution found in Example 15 is not necessarily a good one.
The extraction well is far downgradient from the plume, which means a large volume of clean groundwater must be pumped before any of the contaminated plume
even reaches the well. That can add years of pumping time and raise total costs
considerably before the aquifer is rehabilitated.
A better solution would involve more extraction wells placed closer to the head
of the plume. Javandel and Tsang have derived capture-zone type curves for a series
of n optimally placed wells, each pumping at the same rate Q, lined up along the
y-axis. Optimality is defined to be the maximum spacing between wells that will still
prevent any flow from passing between them. The separation distance for two wells
has been determined to be Q>(pBn). If the wells are any farther apart than this, some
of the flow can pass between them and not be captured. With this optimal spacing,
the two wells will capture a plume as wide as Q>(Bn) along the y-axis and as wide as
2Q>Bn far upgradient from the wells, as shown in Figure 48a. Analogous parameters
for the case of three optimally spaced wells are given in Figure 48b.
A general equation for the positive half of the capture-zone type curve for n
optimally spaced wells arranged symmetrically along the y-axis is:

where fi is the angle between a horizontal line through the ith well and a spot on the
capture-zone curve.
To demonstrate use of these curves, let us redo Example 15, but this time we
will use two wells.

EXAMPLE 16 Capture Zone for Two Wells
Consider the same plume that was described in Example 15—that is, it is rectangular with width 80 m in a confined aquifer with thickness B = 20 m and Darcy
velocity n = 2.0 * 10 - 6 m/s.
a. If two optimally located wells are aligned along the leading edge of the
plume, what minimum pumping rate Q would assure complete plume
capture? How far apart should the wells be?
b. If the plume is 1,000 m long, and the aquifer porosity is 0.30, how long
would it take to pump an amount of water equal to the volume of water
contained in the plume? Notice that it would take much, much longer to
pump out the whole plume than this estimate would suggest since there will
be some uncontaminated groundwater removed with the plume, and we are
ignoring retardation. The effect of retardation on the amount of pumping
needed to clean an aquifer will be considered later.
Solution

80 m, so from Figure 48,

0.0032 m3/s

p * 20 m * 2.0 * 10 - 6 m/s

These dimensions are shown in Figure 49.
b. The volume of contaminated water in the plume is the porosity times the
plume volume:
V = 0.30 * 80 m * 20 m * 1,000 m = 480,000 m3
At a total pumping rate of 2 * 0.0032 m3/s = 0.0064 m3/s, it would take
t =

480,000 m3
0.0064 m3/s * 3600 s/hr * 24 hr/day * 365 day/yr

to pump a volume of water equal to that contained in the plume. Again
note, however, that the time required to pump the actual plume would be
much greater than 2.4 years, depending on retardation and the fraction of
the water pumped that is actually from the plume.
Since real contaminant plumes and aquifers are so much more complex than
the ideal ones considered in this chapter, designing a well field is a much more difficult task than has been presented here. Interested readers are referred to more
advanced texts such as those by Gupta (1989) or Bedient et al. (1994).

15

Control of Groundwater Plumes
We have seen how a column of extraction wells lined up in front of an approaching
groundwater plume can be used to intercept the pollution, preventing it from contaminating the aquifer any further downgradient. Another way to protect downgradient uses, such as a drinking water well, is to use some combination of extraction
wells and injection wells. Extraction wells are used to lower the water table (or
piezometric surface), creating a hydraulic gradient that draws the plume to the
wells. Injection wells raise the water table and push the plume away. Through careful design of the location and pumping rates of such wells, the hydraulic gradient
can be manipulated in such a way that plumes can be kept away from drinking
water wells and drawn toward extraction wells. Extracted, contaminated groundwater can then be treated and reinjected back into the aquifer, reused, or released
into the local surface water system.
Figure 50 shows two strategies to control a contaminant plume that endangers
a nearby well, here called a production well. In Figure 50a an injection well pushes
the plume away from the production well, and an extraction well pulls it away from
the production well. Additional wells would be placed in the plume itself to extract
the contaminants. In Figure 50b, a different strategy is used. The injection well is
used to push the plume into the vicinity of the extraction well so that the plume can
be removed more quickly from the aquifer.

FIGURE 50 Manipulating the hydraulic gradient with multiple wells: (a) the injection and extraction
wells push and pull the plume away from the production well; (b) the injection well pushes the plume

Manipulating the hydraulic gradient to control and remove a groundwater
plume is called hydrodynamic control. The well field used to create hydrodynamic
control of a contaminant plume can be anything from a single extraction well, properly placed and pumping at the right rate, to a complex array of extraction wells and
injection wells.
Hydrodynamic control of groundwater plumes is an effective way to protect
production wells. Construction costs are relatively low, and if the original well field
is not sufficient to control the plume adequately, it is always possible to add additional wells when necessary. In addition, the environmental disturbance on the surface is minimal. On the negative side, the operation and maintenance costs can be
high since the wells must be pumped for many years.
An alternate approach to protecting production wells is literally to surround
the plume with a wall of impermeable material that extends from the surface down
to the aquitard. A number of such physical containment schemes involving different
materials and construction techniques are possible. Perhaps the most common is a
slurry cutoff wall in which a narrow trench, about 1 to 2 m wide, is dug around the
plume, down to bedrock, and then backfilled with a relatively impermeable mixture
of soil and bentonite. The slurry wall keeps the plume from migrating off-site while
other remediation measures are applied to clean up the aquifer.

16

Contaminants in Groundwater
In the discussion of surface water contamination, the focus was on controlling the
spread of infectious diseases, reducing the oxygen demand of the wastes, and removing nutrients to help reduce eutrophication. Surface waters are, of course, also
subject to contamination by a range of toxic chemicals, including pesticides, metals,
PCBs, and so forth, but those pollutants were mentioned only briefly in that context. In the study of groundwater contamination, however, toxic chemicals are the
principal pollutants of concern.
The 25 most frequently detected contaminants found in groundwater at
hazardous waste sites are listed in Table 13. Nine of these contaminants are

Nonaqueous-Phase Liquids
Many of the organic chemicals listed in Table 13 do not dissolve very well in water.
They are called nonaqueous-phase liquids (NAPLs), and their presence makes the
task of restoring an aquifer to drinking water quality very difficult or even impossible. NAPLs are generally divided into two categories: Those that are more dense
than water are called dense NAPLs (DNAPLs), whereas those that are less dense
than water are called light NAPLs (LNAPLs).
Examples of DNAPLs include chlorinated solvents, such as trichloroethylene
and tetrachloroethylene, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides such as chlordane, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Many of the LNAPLs are fuel

hydrocarbons, including crude oil, gasoline, and benzene. Table 14 lists some important NAPLs along with their solubility in water and their specific gravity.
As LNAPLs enter the unsaturated zone, some may dissolve into water in the
pores, some may volatilize and become mixed with air in other pore spaces, and
some may adsorb onto soil particles. When LNAPLs reach the water table, they do
not dissolve well and instead spread out to form a layer of contaminant floating on
top of the saturated zone, as suggested in Figure 51a. DNAPLs also sink, dissolve,
adsorb, and volatilize in the unsaturated zone, but when they reach the water table,
they keep on sinking until they reach a layer of relatively impermeable material.
There they form pools that can overflow and sink to the next impermeable layer, as
suggested in Figure 51b. Portions of DNAPLs tend to form small globules that
become trapped in pore spaces, making them virtually impossible to remove by
pumping. As they remain lodged in tiny crevices, and as they accumulate in pools on
the bottom of aquifers, they slowly dissolve into passing groundwater. Their solubility is so low, however, that removal by dissolution can take centuries. Attempts to
remove DNAPLs by extracting groundwater can be nearly impossible.

257

Water Pollution

Table 14 lists aqueous solubilities for a selection of NAPLs, and those can be
used to make a first-cut estimate of the length of time required to remove NAPLs by
groundwater pumping. The solubilities found in Table 14 tend to be much higher
than those actually found in contaminated aquifers, which tend to be about 10 percent of the theoretical value (NRCouncil, 1994). Consider the following example.
EXAMPLE 17 Estimated Time to Remove a TCE Spill1
Suppose 1 m3 of aquifer is contaminated with 30 L of trichloroethylene (TCE).
The aquifer has porosity of 0.3, groundwater moves through it with an actual
speed of 0.03 m/day, and the TCE has a dissolved concentration equal to 10 percent of its aqueous solubility.
a. Find the mass of dissolved TCE and the mass of undissolved DNAPL.
b. Estimate the time for TCE to be removed.
Solution
a. From Table 14, the aqueous solubility of TCE is given as 1,100 mg/L, but
the actual dissolved TCE is only 10 percent of that, or 110 mg/L. The
porosity of the aquifer is 0.3, so the volume of fluid in 1 m3 of aquifer is
0.3 m3. The amount of dissolved TCE is therefore
Dissolved TCE = 110 mg/L * 0.3 m3 * 103 L/m3 = 33,000 mg = 33 g
Table 14 indicates that the specific gravity of TCE is 1.47. That is, it is 1.47
times the 1.0 kg/L density of water. The total mass of TCE in the aquifer is
therefore
Total TCE = 30 L * 1.47 * 1 kg/L * 103 g/kg = 44,100 g
Since 33 g are dissolved in groundwater, the remaining 44,097 g is NAPL
mass. That is, 99.92 percent of the TCE has not dissolved.
b. If we picture the 1 m3 of aquifer as a cube 1 m on a side, then the rate at
which fluid leaves the cube is

taking away an amount of TCE equal to
TCE flux through 1 m2 = 1 m2 * 0.03 m/day * 33 g/m3 = 0.99 g/day
So the time needed to remove all 44,100 g of TCE would be
Time to remove TCE =

44,100 g
0.99 g/day * 365 day/yr

= 122 years

While Example 17 yields an estimate of over a century to clean this aquifer
completely, in actuality it would probably take even longer. As the globules of TCE
dissolve, their surface area decreases, and the rate at which they dissolve drops, so
the actual time required would be significantly longer than 122 years.

Groundwater Remediation Technologies
Groundwater cleanup may depend on treatment of the water after it has been extracted (ex situ treatment) or treatment of the water in place in the aquifer (in situ
treatment). In this section, we first discuss some of the problems with using the traditional, ex situ pump-and-treat approach. This is followed by a description of another
ex situ approach, but this time based on extracting contaminated gas rather than
water. Finally, two newer in situ approaches are discussed, which, when successful,
can greatly decrease the cost of groundwater remediation.

Conventional Pump-and-Treat Systems
Pump-and-treat technology for aquifer cleanup is based on extracting contaminated
groundwater and then treating it above ground. Treated effluent can then be used
for beneficial purposes or returned to the aquifer. There are an estimated 3,000
pump-and-treat sites in operation in the United States, which represents approximately three-quarters of all groundwater-remediation projects.
The cost of cleaning up an aquifer and the length of time required to do so
escalate dramatically as the level of cleanup desired increases. A hypothetical illustration of the cost and time escalations for a conventional pump-and-treat system is
presented in Figure 52. The example corresponds to a 190-million-liter plume with
an average concentration of 1 mg/L of TCE, using EPA cost estimates, including a
4 percent discount factor. Achieving 80 percent contaminant removal is estimated to
take 15 years and cost $2.8 million (present value, including capital, operation, and
maintenance costs). With a 99.99 percent removal goal, the system would cost
$6 million and take 84 years to complete (NR Council, 1994). Obviously, there are
many assumptions and uncertainties in a calculation such as this one, but the implications are clear.
One assumption in Figure 52 is that the site can be cleaned up using pumpand-treat technology. A recent study by the Committee on Ground Water Cleanup
Alternatives for the National Research Council evaluated 77 contaminated sites
where pump-and-treat systems are operating (NR Council, 1994) and found only
limited circumstances in which such systems would be likely to achieve cleanup

goals in a reasonable period of time at a reasonable cost. They established a site
rating system based on contaminant chemistry and hydrogeology that attempts to
rate sites by their relative ease of cleanup. Four ratings were developed, with
Category 1 sites being the easiest to clean up and Category 4 sites the most difficult.
Category 1 sites are characterized by a single-layer, homogeneous aquifer contaminated with pollutants that are mobile, dissolve easily, and are to some extent
removed naturally by degradation or volatilization. Pump-and-treat technology
should be able to restore groundwater to drinking water quality in these rare sites.
At the other extreme, Category 4 sites have complex hydrogeology involving multiple layers of heterogeneous materials with complex contaminant pathways that
are difficult to predict. The contaminants in Category 4 are NAPLs, with DNAPLs
being the most difficult. Category 4 sites are unlikely to achieve drinking waterquality goals. Of the 77 sites studied by the National Research Council Committee,
only 2 were placed in Category 1, while 42 were ranked Category 4. Table 15 shows
the characteristics of each of the four categories.
Attempting to achieve groundwater cleanup to drinking water standards using
conventional pump-and-treat technology appears to be a futile goal for most contaminated aquifers. This limited effectiveness has motivated the development of a
number of other technologies that can be used to augment or replace the conventional pump-and-treat system. General descriptions follow of the most widely used
alternatives.

Soil Vapor Extraction
Soil vapor extraction (SVE) systems are designed to remove organic vapors from the
unsaturated zone. As shown in Figure 53, the suction side of a blower pulls soil vapors up extraction wells and sends them to a vapor treatment unit. The extraction
wells consist of slotted, plastic pipe set into a permeable packing material. They may

be placed vertically or horizontally depending on circumstances. Horizontal systems
are often used when the contamination is near the surface. The system may include
an air injection system that helps push vapors toward collection wells. The air injection system can be connected to the treatment system, creating a closed-loop system.
A soil cap can help keep the vapors from venting directly to the atmosphere.
Soil vapor extraction systems are effective at removing volatile organic compounds that have leaked from underground storage tanks, such as leaky gasoline
storage tanks at service stations. They may also help remove some NAPLs in the unsaturated zone. A combination of SVE and pump-and-treat can help remove
LNAPLs that tend to sit on the surface of the saturated zone. When the pumping

system lowers the water table, some of the LNAPLs are left behind. LNAPLs that remain sorbed onto particles that are now in an unsaturated zone can then be affected
by the SVE system.
The performance of SVE systems is highly dependent on the characteristics of
the subsurface and the contaminants. Low-permeability zones in the subsurface are
not easily flushed, so contaminants located there will be difficult to remove, and
contaminants that are strongly sorbed to subsurface particles will also resist
removal. With highly volatile substances located in permeable soils, SVE systems
perform well.
SVE systems can be augmented with air sparging systems, as shown in Figure 54. An air sparging system consists of a compressor that drives air through an
injection well into the saturated zone. The injected air rises through the contaminant
plume and captures volatile compounds as it moves. Adsorbed contaminants can
desorb directly into the rising air stream, and dissolved volatile compounds can
move from the liquid phase into the vapor phase to be vacuumed out by the SVE
system. Some air sparging systems have been shown to be very effective at removing
substantial quantities of volatile organic compounds, such as benzene and gasoline.
Air sparging can also be done using a horizontal injection distribution system
that lies under the contamination with a horizontal suction system that is above the
contamination, as shown in Figure 55.

In Situ Bioremediation
In situ systems are designed to degrade subsurface pollution in place without the
need to capture and deliver contaminants to an above-ground treatment system. By
treating contaminants in situ, the need for excavation, above-ground treatment, and
transportation to a disposal site is eliminated, and the risk of human exposure to
hazardous chemicals is greatly reduced. There are other advantages as well, including the potential to degrade compounds that are sorbed to subsurface materials.

FIGURE 56 In situ bioremediation.

In situ bioremediation is based on stimulating the growth of microorganisms,
primarily bacteria, that are indigeneous to the subsurface and that can biodegrade
contaminants. If provided with oxygen (or other electron acceptors) and nutrients,
microorganisms can degrade a number of common soil and groundwater contaminants, especially petroleum-based hydrocarbons, to carbon dioxide and water. If contamination is close to the land surface, the treatment system can be as simple as an
infiltration gallery that allows nutrient- and oxygen-rich water to percolate down
through the contamination zone. For deeper contamination, an injection system, such
as is shown in Figure 56, can deliver the amended water to the desired locations. The
oxygen needed for aerobic decomposition can be supplied by bubbling air or oxygen
into the injected water or by adding hydrogen peroxide. The added nutrients are often
nitrogen and phosphorus when the contaminants are hydrocarbons. Extraction wells
may be added to the system to help control the flow of the injected amended water.

263

Water Pollution

In situ bioremediation has also been applied to more difficult contaminants
than hydrocarbons, including chlorinated solvents and metals. Biodegradation of
chlorinated compounds can be accomplished either aerobically or anaerobically.
The aerobic pathway involves methanotrophic bacteria, which derive their energy
from methane. To stimulate their growth, methane is injected into the contaminated
aquifer. In the process of consuming methane, methanotrophs produce an enzyme
that has the ability to transform hazardous contaminants that are ordinarily resistant to biodegradation. Field studies have demonstrated high rates of transformation for some chlorinated compounds. Semprini et al. (1990) stimulated indigenous
methanotrophic bacteria by injecting dissolved methane and oxygen into an aquifer
under the Moffett Naval Air Station in California. Their experiment showed the following amounts of biodegradation in just a matter of days: trichloroethylene, 20 to
30 percent; cis-l,2-dichloroethylene, 45 to 55 percent; trans-l,2-dichloroethylene,
80 to 90 percent; and vinyl chloride, 90 to 95 percent.
Chlorinated solvents can also be degraded anaerobically. A different consortium of bacteria are involved, and the nutrients that need to be supplied include an
electron donor such as methanol, glucose, or acetate. Some concern has been expressed for intermediate products of this biodegradation, such as vinyl chloride, that
are themselves hazardous. Complete degradation to simple ethene and ethane is possible, but anaerobic processes proceed much more slowly than their aerobic counterparts, and such degradation may take years in the field.

Permeable Reactive Barriers
Since the mid-1990s, permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) have generated more attention and undergone more study than any other technique for remediating underground
contamination (U.S. EPA, 1998). As shown in Figure 57, the PRB is a permeable wall
of specially chosen material through which the contaminated groundwater passes. As
the water passes, the pollutants are removed by one or more processes, including abiotic redox degradation, biotransformation, adsorption, and precipitation. Since the

264

Water Pollution

PRB is only effective if the plume moves through it, the hydraulic conductivity of
the PRB must be greater than that of the aquifer around it. If this is not true, or if over
time the PRB clogs due to filtration of particles, precipitation of solids, or buildup of
solid reaction products, the water will divert around the wall.
The most common material used is granular zero valent iron (ZVI), which is
typically placed in a 2 to 6 feet thick wall. Iron in the zero oxidation state (Fe(0)) is
readily oxidized to ferrous iron (Fe(II)), and the electrons lost can destructively
reduce many of the halogenated organic pollutants listed in Table 13. Using
trichloroethylene as an example, complete reductive dechlorination may follow an
overall reaction such as

(62)

In a similar way to (62), ZVI may be used to treat certain redox-sensitive inorganic
ions such as chromium from Cr(VI) to the less mobile Cr(III) state.
By using materials other than ZVI or in addition to it, removal of additional
contaminants can be accomplished. If the nutrients needed for microbial growth are
included in the reactive barrier, bioremediation and removal of some inorganic and
organic pollutants can be achieved. Microbes stimulated by PRBs have not only been
used to directly degrade a contaminant but also to produce reactants, such as sulfide,
which in turn will either react with or cause the precipitation of the target contaminants. If lime is used in the barrier, the pH may be raised sufficiently that certain
metals will precipitate out. In other applications, a sorbent, such as a hydrous ferric
oxide, has been emplaced to adsorb contaminants such as arsenic and lead (U.S.
EPA, 1998).
Reactive barriers are attractive because they are often relatively low cost,
allow possible cleanup of contaminants that are hard to address otherwise, and
require virtually no upkeep after they are in place. However, their long-term performance has not always been satisfactory. PRBs have failed or performed below
expectations for many reasons, including loss of permeability, loss of iron or media
reactivity, slower than expected reaction kinetics, media clogging or passivation by
microbially generated biomass, and poor hydraulic connection between the aquifer
and the permeable reactive zone. A good place to learn more about PRBs is the
ITRC report (2005) and the additional references in it.

Other Remediation Technologies
None of the groundwater remediation technologies discussed are applicable to all
contaminants in all conditions, and none are without drawbacks. Consequently, a
very large array of other technologies have been employed with varying degrees of
success and ranges of applicability and cost. Enhanced solubilization/mobilization,
thermal desorption, and steam extraction techniques aim to make subsurface contaminants more mobile (reduce retardation and mobilize NAPLs) or more bioavailable, so they can be removed or degraded by one or more of the earlier discussed
technologies. Electrokinetic processes depend on the creation of an electrical field in
the subsurface that can enhance contaminant mobilization or, in a very few cases,

265

Water Pollution

degrade the target pollutant. Isolation techniques, such as impermeable barriers,
vitrification, encapsulation, and soil solidification, attempt to permanently immobilize the contaminant. Abiotic chemical degradation uses injected compounds such as
potassium permanganate or hydrogen peroxide to oxidize subsurface pollutants.
Many variations of bioremediation and combination biotic/abiotic processes have
been reported, including phytoremediation, biosparging, biofiltration, and sequential anaerobic-aerobic techniques. Further discussion of these and other alternative
approaches is beyond the scope of this text, but details can be found in references
such as by Bedient (1999) or from the resources listed by EPA (2001).

In a standard five-day BOD test,

(b) Why is the test run in the dark (or in a black bottle)?
(c) Why is it usually necessary to dilute the sample?
(d) Why is it sometimes necessary to seed the sample?
(e) Why isn’t ultimate BOD measured?
Incoming wastewater, with BOD5 equal to about 200 mg/L, is treated in a well-run secondary treatment plant that removes 90 percent of the BOD. You are to run a five-day

expect after five days?
A standard five-day BOD test is run using a mix consisting of four parts distilled water
and one part wastewater (no seed). The initial DO of the mix is 9.0 mg/L, and the DO
after five days is determined to be 1.0 mg/L. What is BOD5?
A BOD test is to be run on a sample of wastewater that has a five-day BOD of 230 mg/L.
If the initial DO of a mix of distilled water and wastewater is 8.0 mg/L, and the test
requires a decrease in DO of at least 2.0 mg/L with at least 2.0 mg/L of DO remaining at
the end of the five days, what range of dilution factors (P) would produce acceptable
results? In 300-mL bottles, what range of wastewater volumes could be used?

Suppose you are to measure the BOD removal rate for a primary wastewater treatment

A standard BOD test is run using seeded dilution water. In one bottle, the waste sample is
mixed with seeded dilution water giving a dilution of 1:30. Another bottle, the blank,
contains just seeded dilution water. Both bottles begin the test with DO at the saturation

while that containing just seeded dilution water has DO equal to 8.0 mg/L. Find the fiveday BOD of the waste.
A mixture consisting of 30 mL of waste and 270 mL of seeded dilution water has an initial DO of 8.55 mg/L; after five days, it has a final DO of 2.40 mg/L. Another bottle containing just the seeded dilution water has an initial DO of 8.75 mg/L and a final DO of

A clever approach for finding L0 involves daily measurements of BOD (that is, BOD1,
BOD2, BOD3). A straight line is fitted to a plot of BODt + 1 vs. BODt, and the intersection
point of that line with a line drawn through the origin with slope = 1 is then found. That
intersection point occurs where BODt + 1 = BODt; that is, it is the point where BOD is no
longer changing; hence it is L0, as shown in Figure P14.

A wastewater treatment plant discharges 1.0 m3/s of effluent having an ultimate BOD of
40.0 mg/L into a stream flowing at 10.0 m3/s. Just upstream from the discharge point, the

The wastewater in Problem 21 has DO equal to 4.0 mg/L when it is discharged. The river
has its own DO, just upstream from the outfall, equal to 8.0 mg/L. Find the initial oxygen
deficit of the mixture just downstream from the discharge point. The temperatures of
sewage and river are both 15°C.
A single source of BOD causes an oxygen sag curve with a minimum downstream DO
equal to 6.0 mg/L. If the BOD of the waste is doubled (without increasing the waste flow
rate), what would be the new minimum downstream DO? In both cases, assume that
the initial oxygen deficit just below the source is zero, and the saturated value of DO is
10.0 mg/L. (Note that when the initial deficit is zero, the deficit at any point is proportional to the initial BOD.)
The oxygen sag caused by a cannery reaches a minimum DO equal to 3.0 mg/L. Upstream
from the cannery, the river DO is saturated at 10.0 mg/L, and it has no BOD of its own.
Just downstream from the discharge point, the DO is still essentially saturated (i.e., consider the initial oxygen deficit to be zero so the downstream deficit is proportional to initial BOD). By what percentage should the BOD of the cannery waste be reduced to assure
a healthy stream with at least 5.0 mg/L DO everywhere?

An underground storage tank leaks tetrachloroethylene (PCE) at a rate of 100 mL/d
(about the volume of a small lemon per day). This continues for one year before the leak
is discovered and stopped. The tank lies at the water table, so all of the PCE released
enters the sand aquifer (but is not necessarily immediately dissolved in the groundwater).
The aquifer is 4.0 m deep and composed of sand. The actual groundwater velocity is
0.09 m/d, and the hydraulic gradient is 0.0005. The retardation factor for PCE is 6.

(b) How far would you expect the PCE to have traveled down gradient during the oneyear period?
(c) Assume the dissolved PCE distributes uniformly in the aquifer and forms a plume

PCE concentration in the plume?
(d) If one well is placed on the centerline of the leading edge of the plume, what will its
pumping rate need to be to capture the plume?
(e) What is the minimum duration the extraction well will need to be operated to remove

Our planet is shrouded in water, and yet 8 million children under the age of five
will die this year from lack of safe water.

1 Introduction
One of the first things that world travelers worry about is whether it is safe to drink
the water and whether uncooked foods washed in local water are safe to eat. The
unfortunate answer in most places is “no.” For more than two billion people in the
developing countries of the world, access to safe drinking water is simply not possible.
The rest of us usually assume (correctly, in most circumstances) that water coming out
the tap is clean and safe. That important luxury is the result of the coordinated efforts
of scientists, engineers, water plant operators, and regulatory officials.
Our traditional confidence in the quality of drinking water in the United
States, however, has been shaken of late. In 1993, 400,000 people in Milwaukee

became ill, and more than 100 died, from an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium,
in their drinking water. In the same year, residents of Manhattan and others in the
Washington, DC, area were told to boil their water when surprising numbers of
E. coli bacteria began to show up in their drinking water, despite heavy doses
of chlorination. Compounding the chlorination problem has been the realization
that byproducts of the disinfection process may be causing on the order of 10,000
cancer cases per year in the United States. The seriousness of these problems has led
the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development to
identify drinking water disinfection as one of its 6 highest-priority research topics in
its 1996 Strategic Plan (U.S. EPA, 1996).
Two complementary approaches are necessary to protect the quality of our
water. Legislative bodies provide the laws that regulatory agencies use to define
acceptable discharges and establish standards that govern the minimum quality of
water for its many beneficial uses. The scientific and engineering community provides the technical guidance needed by legislators and regulators, as well as the technology that is used to achieve those standards. This chapter will explore both.

2 Municipal Water and Wastewater Systems
Two critical systems combine to break the carrier-feces-water-victim sequence
responsible for the spread of waterborne diseases. The first is the water collection,
treatment, and distribution system that provides safe drinking water. The principal
legislation in the United States that regulates drinking water quality is the Safe
Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The second is the wastewater collection and treatment
system that removes contaminants before they are released back into the local
stream, lake, estuary, or coastal waters. The Clean Water Act (CWA) governs
the discharge of wastewater effluents and the water quality in the receiving body
of water. With increased population and water shortages, the discharges from
wastewater systems are becoming more closely linked to the source waters for
drinking water systems. The time between when treated and, as is too often the case
worldwide, untreated wastewater is discharged to the environment and when it is
taken up again for human use is becoming increasingly short. Even now in most
large U.S. municipalities, treated wastewater is used for nonpotable purposes such
as turf irrigation and, within the near future, will be required for higher quality, even
potable, uses. The primary responsibility of these two systems is to kill pathogens
before and after water is used, although removal of other toxins such as industrial
solvents, heavy metals, and even pharmaceutical products is gaining increased attention. Wastewater treatment systems also reduce biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
and nutrient loading to protect the ecological health of the receiving water.
As shown in Figure 1, municipal systems may get their water from a local
stream, reservoir, or groundwater system. Larger cities tend to rely heavily on
surface water supplies, whereas small community water systems more often take
advantage of groundwater. In the United States, about half of the drinking water
comes from surface water supplies and the other half from groundwater.
After water is used in households and businesses, it is collected in a sanitary
sewer system and sent to the local wastewater treatment facility. Industrial wastewater

may be treated and released directly into the receiving body of water, or it may go to
the municipal sanitary sewer system. The industrial effluent often must receive some
pretreatment before it can be released. Wastewater dischargers must obtain permits
issued under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). An
NPDES permit requires the discharger to meet certain technology-based effluent
limits and perform effluent monitoring.
Also shown in Figure 1 is a storm sewer system that collects run-off from
urban streets. In older cities, the stormwater sewer lines join the sanitary system, and
the combination of wastewaters flows to the municipal wastewater treatment plant.
About 1,000 communities in the United States, primarily in the Northeast and Great
Lakes region, use combined sewer systems (U.S. EPA, 1999). These combined systems are unsatisfactory when it rains because they often end up carrying more
wastewater than the local treatment system can handle. When that happens, a portion of the flow, which includes raw sewage, must be diverted around the treatment
plant and released directly into the receiving water. The result is contaminated
shorelines that must be posted with warnings after almost every storm. Separating
these combined systems is immensely expensive. The preferred approach has been to
create massive reservoirs, often underground, that store the combined flow until the
storm passes, after which time the reservoir is slowly drained back into the sanitary
sewer system.
In newer cities, and in newer sections of old cities, the stormwater collection
system is completely separated from the sanitary sewer system to avoid the problem
of overloading. Separated systems are not without their own problems, however.
Run-off from streets and impervious areas during both wet and dry periods may be
passed untreated into the local receiving water and often carries a heavy load of
organics, metals, and sediment.

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)
Legislation to protect drinking water quality in the United States began with the
Public Health Service Act of 1912. In this Act, the nation’s first water quality standards were created. These standards slowly evolved over the years, but it wasn’t
until the passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 that federal
responsibility was extended beyond interstate carriers to include all community water
systems regularly serving 15 or more outlets, or 25 or more customers. This extended
federal regulation to cover the drinking water of about 90 percent of the people in
the United States. Most community water systems are large; in fact, about 7 percent
of the community water systems serve about 81 percent of the people. This original
SDWA had two basic thrusts: (1) it required the EPA to establish national standards
for drinking water quality, and (2) it required the operators of some 160,000 public
water systems in the country to monitor the quality of water being delivered to customers and to treat that water, if necessary, to assure compliance with the standards.
Since enactment of the 1974 SDWA, there have been more than 10 major revisions and additions to the act with the most significant being the 1986 and 1996
amendments. In 1986, EPA was directed to quicken the pace of standard setting,
including requirement of the equivalent of filtration for all surface water supplies
and disinfection for all water systems. The regulations also recognized the potential
for lead contamination in water distribution systems, including the plumbing systems in homes and nonresidential facilities. To help prevent lead poisoning, the
1986 amendments require the use of lead-free pipe, solder, and flux for all such systems. (In the past, solder normally contained about 50 percent lead; now it may contain no more than 0.2 percent lead.) In 1996, Congress added a requirement for all
large municipal water systems to report annually to their customers data on the
quality of their drinking water. Other provisions require additional controls on
harmful pollutants, such as Cryptosporidium, and that EPA determine if the benefits
justify the costs of any new regulation. In addition, in 2002, Congress added amendments to address water system security in response to heightened concern that
contaminants could be intentionally put into public drinking water systems.
Drinking water standards fall into two categories: primary standards and secondary standards. Primary standards are enforceable and based on health-related
criteria. Secondary standards are unenforceable guidelines based on both aesthetics,
such as taste, odor, and color of drinking water, as well as nonaesthetic characteristics, such as corrosivity and hardness. In setting primary standards, EPA is required
to balance the public health benefits of the standard against what is technologically
and economically feasible. In this way, they are quite different from National
Ambient Air Quality Standards, which must be set at levels that protect public
health regardless of cost or feasibility. Of the 92 primary standards enacted by 2005,
83 specified Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs), such as the 0.010 mg/L concentration set for arsenic. In 9 cases, a treatment technique (TT) is required rather than
an MCL because the pollutant may be difficult or too time-consuming to detect and
measure. For example, because detection of pathogens such as viruses, Giardia,
and Cryptosporidium is difficult, the standard simply specifies water filtration as
the requirement.
As a prerequisite to establishing a primary standard, EPA sets an unenforceable Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) for each contaminant. These

284

Water Quality Control

goals are set at levels that present no known or anticipated health effects, including a
margin of safety, regardless of technological feasibility or cost. Because exposure to
any amount of a cancer-causing chemical is deemed to pose some risk to the individual, the MCLGs for carcinogens are generally set to zero. The 1996 SDWA requires
EPA to review every primary standard at least every six years to determine whether
they can be brought closer to the desired MCLGs. In addition, under the impetus of
the SDWA, the list of primary standards is continuously being updated and expanded
to include previously unregulated contaminants, which are shown to pose unacceptable health risks. A list of primary drinking water standards is given in Table 1.

Chemical Standards
Inorganic chemicals include highly toxic metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, and
mercury; nitrite (NO2) and nitrate (NO3), which can cause methemoglobinemia
(blue-baby syndrome); fluoride, which is purposely added to water to help prevent
dental caries but which can cause mottling of teeth, if the exposure is excessive; and
asbestos fibers, which are especially dangerous when inhaled, but their danger is less
certain for ingestion (the MCL is written in terms of millions of fibers per liter with
lengths greater than 10 microns).
Organic chemical contaminants for which MCLs have been promulgated are
classified using the following three groupings:
1. Synthetic Organic Chemicals (SOCs) are compounds used in the manufacture of a wide variety of agricultural and industrial products. This includes
primarily insecticides and herbicides.
2. Volatile Organic Chemicals (VOCs) are synthetic chemicals that readily
vaporize at room temperature. These include degreasing agents, paint thinners, glues, dyes, and some pesticides. Representative chemicals include
benzene; carbon tetrachloride; 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA); trichlorethylene
(TCE); and vinyl chloride.
3. Disinfectant byproducts (DBPs) are the byproducts formed when a disinfectant reacts with chemicals in the water to form a toxic product. There are
both organic and inorganic DBPs. The two types of regulated organic DBPs,
trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), are both formed when
chlorine is used as a disinfectant and reacts with certain types of organic compounds in the water. Both THMs and HAAs are associated with an increased

286

Water Quality Control

risk of cancer. This creates somewhat of a dilemna in drinking water treatment because the addition of disinfectants such as chlorine is clearly beneficial
for inactivation of microbial pathogens that cause most waterborne diseases,
yet byproducts of their addition may cause cancer. This is an example of why
the 1996 SDWA amendments specify that the overall health risk from contaminants must be minimized by balancing between competing risks. For
DBPs, the most common solution is to remove the DBP-forming compounds
(called precursors) from the water before the disinfectant is added.

Radionuclides
Radioactivity in public drinking water supplies is another category of contaminants
regulated by the SDWA. Some radioactive compounds, or radionuclides, are naturally occurring substances such as radon and radium-226, which are often found in
groundwater. Others, such as strontium-90 and tritium, are surface water contaminants resulting from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing fallout. The MCLs for
most radionuclides are expressed as picocuries per liter (pCi/L), where 1 pCi/L corresponds to 2.2 radioactive decays per minute (which is the decay rate of 1 gram of
radium). For example, the gross alpha particle activity MCL (including radium-226
but excluding radon and uranium) is 15 pCi/L. The MCL for beta particles and
photon radioactivity is an annual dose, either to the whole body or to any particular
organ, of 4 millirem/year.
Although, as of 2005, an MCL had not yet been finally established for radon,
it is perhaps the most important radionuclide associated with drinking water. It is a
colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that occurs naturally in some groundwater. It
is an unusual contaminant because the danger arises not from drinking radoncontaminated water but from breathing the gas after it has been released into the air.
When radon-laden water is heated or agitated, such as occurs in showers or washing
machines, the dissolved radon gas is released. Inhaled radon gas is thought to be a
major cause of lung cancer. The proposed radon drinking water standard encourages states to adopt what is called a Multimedia Mitigation (MMM) program by allowing 4,000 pCi/L of radon in drinking water, if an authorized program is
implemented to minimize radon exposure from nonwater-related indoor air sources.
If an MMM program is not implemented, then the proposed MCL for radon is 300
pCi/L.

Microbiological Standards
Another category of primary MCLs is microbiological contaminants. Although it
would be desirable to evaluate the safety of a given water supply by individually
testing for specific pathogenic microorganisms, such tests are too difficult to perform on a routine basis or to be used as a standard. Instead, a much simpler technique is used, based on testing water for evidence of any fecal contamination. In this
test, coliform bacteria (typically Escherichia coli) are used as indicator organisms
whose presence suggests that the water is contaminated. Because the number of coliform bacteria excreted in feces is on the order of 50 million per gram, and the concentration of coliforms in untreated domestic wastewater is usually several million
per 100 mL, it would be highly unlikely that water contaminated with human

287

Water Quality Control

wastes would have no coliforms. That conclusion is the basis for the drinking water
standard for microbiological contaminants, which specifies that for large water systems (serving more than 10,000 people), no more than 5 percent of the test samples
can show any coliforms; for smaller systems testing fewer than 40 samples per
month, no more than 1 sample can test positive.
The assumption that the absence of coliforms implies an absence of pathogens
is based primarily on the following two observations. First, in our society, it is the
excreta from relatively few individuals that adds pathogens to a wastestream,
whereas the entire population contributes coliforms. Thus the number of coliforms
should far exceed the number of pathogens. Secondly, for many of the waterborne
diseases that have plagued humankind, the survival rate of pathogens outside the
host is much lower than the survival rate of coliforms. The combination of these factors suggests that, statistically speaking, the ratio of pathogens to coliforms should
be sufficiently small that we can conclude that it is extremely unlikely that a sample
of water would contain a pathogen without also containing numerous coliforms.
This approach to testing for microbiological purity has been effective, but it is
not an absolutely certain measure. For example, some nonbacterial pathogens,
notably viruses and cysts from protozoa (such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium), survive considerably longer outside of their hosts than coliform bacteria, which increases the probability of encountering pathogens without accompanying coliforms. An
additional problem exists in relying totally on coliforms as an indicator organism
for microbiological contamination. For many cases, coliforms are more easily inactivated than other pathogens, such as viruses and protozoa, by chemical disinfectants.
Thus, post-disinfectant sampling may indicate a lack of viable coliforms, while other
pathogens are still active. To overcome this limitation in solely relying on coliforms as
indicator organisms, a number of somewhat complex rules have been made or proposed in the past decade that specify credits for various treatment techniques and
require that the sum of the credits in a particular water treatment process ensure that
there is 99.99 percent inactivation or removal of enteric viruses, 99.9 percent of
Giarda, and 99 percent of Cryptosporidium. These requirements are termed 4-log,
3-log, and 2-log removal of viruses, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium, respectively.
The coliform test is also used to assess the safety of water-contact recreational activities, with many states recommending a limit of 1,000 coliforms per
100 mL. However, proper interpretation of a coliform test made on surface water is
complicated by the fact that fecal coliforms are discharged by animals as well as
humans. Thus a high fecal coliform count is not necessarily an indication of human
contamination. When it is important to distinguish between human and animal contamination, more sophisticated testing can be performed. Such testing is based on
the fact that the ratio of fecal coliform to fecal streptococci is different in human and
animal discharges.

Secondary Standards
EPA’s secondary standards are nonenforceable, maximum contaminant levels intended
to protect public welfare. Public welfare criteria include factors such as taste, color,
corrosivity, and odor, rather than health effects. The limits suggested in Table 2 are
in large part based on taste, and although not required by EPA, have been adopted
by some states as enforceable requirements. Excessive sulfate is undesirable because

gases may make water unacceptable to the drinker.

4 Water Treatment Systems
The purpose of water treatment systems is to bring raw water up to drinking water
quality. The particular type of treatment equipment required to meet these standards
depends largely on the source of water. About half of the drinking water in the
United States comes from groundwater, and half comes from surface water. Most
large cities rely more heavily on surface water, whereas most small towns or communities depend more on groundwater. Typically surface water treatment focuses
on particle removal, and groundwater treatment focuses on removal of dissolved
inorganic contaminants such as calcium and iron. Producing a water free of microbial pathogens is critical for any water source, but surface water has a much
greater chance of microbial contamination, so filtration is now a requirement for
surface water.
As suggested in Figure 2, a typical treatment plant for surface water might include the following sequence of steps:
1. Screening and grit removal take out relatively large floating and suspended
debris and the sand and grit that settles very rapidly which may damage
equipment.
2. Primary sedimentation (also called settling or clarification) removes the particles that will settle out by gravity alone within a few hours.

3. Rapid mixing and coagulation use chemicals and agitation to encourage suspended particles to collide and adhere into larger particles.
4. Flocculation, which is the process of gently mixing the water, encourages the
formation of large particles of floc that will more easily settle.
5. Secondary settling slows the flow enough so that gravity will cause the floc
to settle.
6. Filtration removes particles and floc that are too small or light to settle by
gravity.
7. Sludge processing refers to the dewatering and disposing of solids and liquids collected from the settling tanks.
8. Disinfection contact provides sufficient time for the added disinfectant to
inactivate any remaining pathogens before the water is distributed.
Groundwater is much freer of particles and pathogens than surface water, and
in many places, it is delivered after disinfection alone. However, because groundwater often moves through the soils and minerals of the subsurface for long periods
before withdrawal, it may contain high levels of dissolved minerals or objectionable
gases. The most common dissolved mineral contaminants are calcium and magnesium, which are termed hardness. The calcium and magnesium can be removed by
precipitating them as particles, so some softening steps are similar to the particle
removal steps for a surface water. Figure 3 shows a typical groundwater treatment
plant with the following unit operations:
1. Aeration removes excess and objectionable gases.
2. Flocculation (and precipitation) follows chemical addition, which forces the
calcium and magnesium above their solubility limits.
3. Sedimentation removes the hardness particles that will now settle by gravity.
4. Recarbonation readjusts the water pH and alkalinity and may cause additional precipitation of hardness-causing ions.
5. Filtration, disinfection, and solids processing serve the same purposes as for
surface water treatment.

Sedimentation
Sedimentation or gravitational settling of particles from water is one of the oldest
and simplest forms of water treatment. Simply allowing water to sit quietly in anything from a jar to a reservoir, decanting the water, and then using the undisturbed
surface water often considerably improves the water’s quality. A sedimentation
basin or clarifier is a large circular or rectangular tank designed to hold the water
for a long enough time to allow most of the suspended solids to settle out. The
longer the detention time, the bigger and more expensive the tank must be, but
correspondingly, the better will be the tank’s performance. Clarifiers are usually
equipped with a bottom scraper that removes collected sludge.
Sedimentation can remove particles that are contaminants themselves or may
harbor other contaminants, such as pathogens or adsorbed metals. Although particles have very irregular shapes, their size may be described by an equivalent diameter that is determined by comparing them with spheres having the same settling
velocity. The equivalent diameter is the hydrodynamic diameter when we speak of
particles settling in water, and aerodynamic diameter for particles settling in air.
We can use a fairly simple analysis to calculate the settling velocity of a
spherical particle. When such a particle reaches its terminal velocity, the gravitational force pulling it down is balanced by a drag force and a buoyancy force

(Figure 4). The drag force is a function of the particle’s Reynolds number, which is
expressed as

where
r = density of water

m = absolute viscosity of water
Although particles in water may have Reynolds numbers in the laminar (Re 6 1),
transition (1 6 Re 6 10,000), or turbulent (Re 7 104) regions, we only need to
consider the laminar region case to understand the basics of sedimentation basin
operation. In the laminar region, the drag force is
FD = 3pmnsdp

The critical settling velocity (also known as the surface loading rate or
the overflow rate) is the minimum settling velocity that a particle can have and still
be guaranteed to be removed in the settling basin. In other words, 100 percent of
the particles whose settling velocity is equal to or greater than the critical settling
velocity, no, will be removed by the basin. Therefore, based on (7) and (5), if we
want to design a clarifier to remove all particles of a size, dp, from a water stream
with a flow rate, Q, the surface area, Ab, of the rectangular basin must be
Ab =

18Qm
g(rp - r)d2p

(8)

Although many clarifiers in both water and wastewater treatment plants are circular
rather than rectangular, (7) and (8) still apply; however, for the circular clarifier, the
basin surface area is p times the basin’s radius squared, rather than its width times
its length as with a rectangular basin. In most circular settling tanks, the influent
water enters at the center, and the treated effluent leaves the perimeter of the tank as
it overflows across a weir. If the tank is too small and wastewater flows too quickly
toward the overflow weir, the solids will be moving too fast to settle. Overflow rates
typically are in the range of 1 to 2.5 m3 # m-2 # h-1. Another parameter that influences
clarifier performance is the detention time of the tank. The hydraulic detention time
in any tank is its volume divided by the influent flow rate. This is numerically equal
to the time that would be required to fill an empty tank with water entering at the
daily average flow rate. Although the overflow rate does not depend on the depth of
the sedimentation basin, the detention time does. Typical detention times range from
1 to 4 hours.

EXAMPLE 1 Silt Removal in a Clarifier
A drinking water treatment plant uses a circular sedimentation basin to treat
3.0 MGD of river water. (MGD stands for million gallons per day and is a common U.S. measure of flow rate used for water and wastewater treatment.
1.0 MGD = 0.0438 m3/s). After storms occur upstream, the river often carries
0.010 mm silt particles with an average density of 2.2 g/cm3, and the silt must be
removed before the water can be used. The plant’s clarifier is 3.5 m deep and 21 m
in diameter. The water is 15°C.
a. What is the hydraulic detention time of the clarifier?
b. Will the clarifier remove all of the silt particles from the river water?
Solution
a. The hydraulic detention time, u (theta), of a flow-through vessel is
u = V>Q

(9)

where V is the vessel’s volume, and Q is the flow rate through the vessel.
The volume of a circular basin is
V =

pd2b h
4

where db is the basin’s diameter, and h is its depth. Thus, the clarifier
detention time is
u =

pd2bh
p(21 m)2(3.5 m)
=
= 9,226 s = 2.6 hr
4Q
4(3.0 MGD)(0.0438 m3/s/MGD)

b. To find if the silt particles will be removed, we need to calculate their settling
velocity and compare it to the critical velocity for the sedimentation basin.
We first need the water density r and the viscosity m. “Density and Viscosity
of Water and Air,” the water density and viscosity at 15°C are found to be
999.1 kg # m - 3 and 0.00114 kg # m - 1 # s - 1, respectively. The gravitational
acceleration constant g is found, “Useful Constants.” Then using (5), the
particle settling velocity is
ns =

(9.807 m # s - 2)(2,200 - 999.1 kg # m - 3)(10 - 5 m)2
18(0.00114 kg # m - 1 # s - 1)

= 5.74 * 10 - 5 m/s

The critical velocity for the sedimentation basin is found using (7) as
no =

h
3.5 m
=
= 38 * 10 - 5 m/s
u
9,226 s

The silt’s settling velocity is much less than the basin’s critical velocity, so all
of the silt will not be removed by the treatment plant’s clarifier. Note that
the critical velocity could also have been calculated by dividing the flow
rate by the clarifier’s surface area.

Water Quality Control

Coagulation and Flocculation
Raw water may contain suspended particles that are too small to settle by gravity in
a reasonable time period and cannot be removed by simple filtration. Many of these
particles are colloids (particles in the size range of about 0.001 to 1 mm). The goal
of coagulation is to alter the particle surfaces in such a way as to permit them to
adhere to each other. Thus, they can grow to a size that will allow removal by sedimentation or filtration. Coagulation is considered to be a chemical treatment
process that destabilizes particles (makes them “sticky”), as opposed to a physical
treatment operation such as flocculation, sedimentation, or filtration.
Most colloids and nonsettleable particles of interest in water treatment remain
suspended in solution because they have a net negative surface charge that causes
the particles to repel each other. The coagulant’s purpose is to neutralize the surface
charge, thus allowing the particles to come together to form larger particles that can
be more easily removed. The usual coagulant is alum, Al2(SO4)3 # 18H2O, although
FeCl3, FeSO4, and other coagulants, such as polyelectrolytes, can be used. Because
the intention here is simply to introduce the concepts of water treatment, leaving the
complexities for more specialized books, let us just look at the reactions involving
alum. Alum ionizes in water, producing Al3 + ions, some of which neutralize the negative charges on the colloids. Most of the aluminum ions, however, react with alkalinity in the water (bicarbonate) to form insoluble aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3.
The overall reaction is
Al2(SO4)3 # 18H2O + 6HCO3- ¡
— 2Al(OH)3p + 6CO2 + 18H2O + 3SO24
Alum

Aluminum
hydroxide

(10)

Sulfates

If insufficient bicarbonate is available for this reaction to occur, the pH must be
raised, usually by adding lime Ca(OH)2 or sodium carbonate (soda ash), Na2CO3.
The aluminum hydroxide precipitate forms a light, fluffy floc that adsorbs destabilized particles on its surface as it settles. The destabilized particles may also aggregate and grow by colliding with each other. The degree of particle destabilization is
quantified by the collision efficiency factor, a, which is defined as the fraction of the
number of collisions between particles that result in aggregation. If the particles are
completely destabilized, then every collision results in aggregation, and a = 1.0,
whereas, for instance, if a = 0.25, only one in four collisions between particles
results in the colliding particles sticking together.
Coagulants are added to the raw water in a rapid mix/coagulation tank that
has quickly rotating impellers to mix the chemicals. Detention times in the tank are
typically less than one-half minute. Flocculation follows in a tank that provides
gentle agitation for approximately one-half hour. During this time, the precipitating
aluminum hydroxide forms a plainly visible floc. The mixing in the flocculation tank
must be done very carefully. It must be sufficient to encourage particles to make contact with each other and enable the floc to grow in size, but it cannot be so vigorous
that the fragile floc particles will break apart. Mixing also helps keep the floc from
settling in this tank, rather than in the sedimentation tank that follows. Figure 6
shows a cross-section of a mixing tank followed by a sedimentation tank.
The level of agitation in the flocculation tank is characterized by a parameter,
G, the root mean square velocity gradient or more simply the mixing intensity. G is

the primary parameter the engineer uses to maximize the rate of collisions between
particles, without mixing so intensely that the flocs break up. The mixing intensity G
depends on the power input to the paddles as given by
G =

P
B mVb

(11)

where P is the power input to the paddles (or other mixing method), Vb is the volume
of the vessel, and m is the viscosity of the water.
The rate of aggregation of particles can be seen as the rate of change of the
total particle number concentration. The particle number concentration, N, is the
total number of particles (where each particle counts as a single particle, whether it’s
an aggregate or a singlet) divided by the volume of water. Each time two particles
collide to form an aggregate, the number concentration is decreased by one. Thus,
the rate of flocculation can be mathematically expressed as dN兾dt. This is analogous
to how the rate of change of the contaminant concentration with time was represented. Because mixing is inherent in flocculation basins (Figure 6), each chamber
acts as a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with the effluent number concentration from one chamber being the influent number concentration for the next
chamber. Detailed coagulation/flocculation theory is complex and beyond this text’s
scope. However, a useful understanding of the processes can be gained by considering a simple, yet still practically relevant set of conditions. The following analysis
assumes the simple case in which all the particles are initially nearly the same size
(called a monodisperse distribution), the water mixing is relatively mild (termed
laminar mixing), and an aggregate’s volume is the sum of the volumes of the individual particles comprising the aggregate (termed coalescing aggregation). For this
case, the flocculation rate can be expressed as a first-order process.
r(N) = - kN

(12)

where
k =

a4ÆG
p

(13)

a is the collision efficiency factor discussed earlier, and Æ is the floc volume, which
is defined as
pd3pN0
Æ =

6

(14)

where N0 is the initial number concentration of monodisperse particles of diameter,
dp. You can think of the floc volume Æ as the total volume of solids per volume of

296

Water Quality Control

water. In other words, it is the particle volume concentration, as opposed to the
particle number concentration. Because we assume coalescing aggregation, the floc
volume concentration is constant, even though the particle number concentration
changes as aggregation occurs.

EXAMPLE 2 Silt Flocculation Before Sedimentation
To improve their settling, the 0.010 mm silt particles in Example 1 are completely destabilized by adding alum and are passed through one of two side-by-side,
well-mixed flocculation chambers. The chambers are cubic with each dimension
being 3.5 m. They are mixed with paddle mixers that input 2.50 kW of power
into the water in each chamber. The water entering the flocculation chamber contains 105 particles per mL. What is the average diameter of the aggregates leaving
the flocculation chambers?
Solution Each chamber handles half of the plant’s 3.0 MGD, so we will analyze one chamber receiving 1.5 MGD. First, we find the mixing intensity, G,
using (11).
G =

(2.50 kW)(1,000 W/kW)
B (0.001145 kg # m-1 # s-1)(3.5 m)3

= 226 s-1

The flocculation chamber acts as a steady state CSTR in which a first-order decay
in particle number concentration is occurring (Figure 7).
The mass balance for a steady state CSTR with first-order decay is input
rate = output rate + VbkC. For the flocculation chamber, we write this equation
in terms of number concentration N, rather than mass concentration C, and use
the variables defined in Figure 7 to give
QN0 = QN + VbkN
where N0 is the influent number concentration, and N is effluent concentration.
By using (13) and dividing through by N, this becomes

To find the floc volume Æ in (14), we need the particle diameter dp and the initial

Filtration
Filtration is one of the most widely used and effective means of removing small particles from water. This also includes pathogens, which are essentially small particles.
For drinking water filtration, the most common technique is called rapid depth
filtration. The rapid depth filter consists of a layer or layers of carefully sieved filter
media, such as sand, anthracite coal, or diatomaceous earth, on top of a bed of
graded gravels. The pore openings between the media grains are often greater than
the size of the particles that are to be removed, so much of the filtration is accomplished by means other than simple straining. Adsorption, continued flocculation,
and sedimentation in the pore spaces are important removal mechanisms. When the
filter becomes clogged with particles, the filter is shut down for a short period of
time and cleaned by forcing water backwards through the media. After backwashing, the media settles back in place and operation resumes.
Rapid depth filters typically operate with filtration rates (also called loading
rates or superficial velocities) between 2 and 10 gpm/ft2 (5 - 25 m3 m-2 hr-1). The filtration rate, na, is the volumetric flow rate divided by the filter’s cross-sectional
area, Af:
na =

Q
Af

(15)

A filter’s surface area is normally less than 100 m2, so banks of multiple filters are
operated to treat large volumes of water. Having multiple filters allows continuous
production of water even though at any given time one or more filters are being
backwashed. Because some of the clean water produced in every filtration cycle

298

Water Quality Control

must be used to backwash (and rinse the backwash water from the filter), less than
100 percent of the water that is filtered is actually available for distribution. The
fraction of the water that is usable is the filter efficiency (or production efficiency),
hf, and the net rate of water production is the effective filtration rate, ref. These
measures of a filter’s performance are defined as
hf =

duration of time that the filter is backwashing (hr)
duration of time that the filter is rinsing (hr)

Comparing the effective filtration rate (ref) to the filtration rate (na) indicates how
much the overall throughput rate of the filter is decreased by backwashing and
rinsing. Rapid depth filters are designed with filter efficiencies of greater than
95 percent and, therefore, effective filtration rates approaching their loading rates.
Filtration rates, na, typically range from 2–8 gpm/ft2.

Disinfection
The final, primary unit operation in most water treatment trains is disinfection.
Disinfection has to meet two objectives: primary disinfection, to kill any pathogens
in the water, and secondary (or residual) disinfection to prevent pathogen regrowth
in the water during the period before it is used. Although traditionally a single disinfectant was added to the water to serve both purposes, it is becoming more common
to use one chemical as the primary disinfectant and another as the residual disinfectant.
The most commonly used method of disinfection in the U.S. is free
chlorine disinfection because it is cheap, reliable, and easy to use. Free chlorine in
water is developed by dosing with either chlorine gas (Cl2(g)), sodium hypochlorite
(NaOCl) or calcium hypochlorite (Ca(OCl)2). The dosed chemical reacts in the
water to produce dissolved chlorine gas (Cl2(aq)), hypochlorous acid (HOCl), and
hypochlorite (OCl-), which all contribute to the free chlorine concentration. The
relative proportion of each is a function of pH, as shown in the following two
reactions:
Cl2(aq) + H2O = HOCl + H + + Cl-

(18)

HOCl = OCl- + H +

299

Water Quality Control

Hypochlorous acid is a much stronger disinfectant than hypochlorite, so free
chlorine disinfection is usually conducted in slightly acidic water (see Example 2.8).
Dissolved chlorine gas does not contribute significantly to the free chlorine concentration unless the water pH is less than 3, which is too acidic (corrosive) for practical use. Although free chlorine is very effective against bacteria, its effectiveness is
less with protozoan cysts, most notably those of Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium, and with viruses. In almost all circumstances, complete treatment, including
coagulation, sedimentation, filtration, as well as disinfection, is used to meet the
microbiological standards of the Safe Drinking Water Act. (More information on
pathogens and the requirements for their removal from drinking water was provided
earlier in this chapter in Section 3.)
A principal advantage of chlorination over other forms of disinfection is that a
chlorine residual is created that provides secondary disinfection of the treated water
after leaving the treatment plant. This guards against possible contamination that
might occur in the water distribution system. To increase the lifetime of this residual, some systems add ammonia to the treated water. Ammonia reacts with free
chlorine to form chloramines (NH2Cl, NHCl2, and NCl3), which are termed combined chlorine. Chloramines are less effective as oxidants than HOCl and hence are
seldom used as primary disinfectants. However, they are more persistent than free
chlorine and maintain secondary disinfection in distribution systems even with long
residence times.
A disadvantage of free chlorine is the formation of halogenated disinfectant
byproducts (DBPs). DBPs include trihalomethanes (THMs), such as the carcinogen,
chloroform (CHCl3), and haloacetic acids (HAAs). THMs and HAAs are created
when free chlorine combines with natural organic substances, such as decaying
vegetation, that may be present in the water. One approach to reducing THMs is to
remove more of the organics before chlorination takes place. It was common practice in the past to chlorinate the incoming raw water before coagulation and filtration, but it has since been realized that this contributes to the formation of DBPs.
By moving the free chlorine primary disinfection point to follow coagulation/
flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration, many of the organic DBP precursors are
removed, and some degree of THM control is achieved.
The problem of free chlorine DBPs has spurred interest in alternative primary
disinfectants, such as chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and ozone (O3). Each has the advantage of not creating THMs or HAAs, but as more research is done, it has been found
that they create other DBPs. For instance, ClO2 may break down to form chlorite,
which has an MCL of 1.0 mg/L, and ozone creates bromate, which has an MCL of
0.010 mg/L, when bromide is present in the water. The relative risk posed by these
DBPs and their likelihood of formation relative to free chlorine DBPs is the subject
of considerable current research. Chlorine dioxide is a potent bactericide and viricide. However, it is a very costly method of disinfection and because it is an explosive gas, it must be generated on site. Ozone is the most powerful disinfectant and is
more effective against cysts and viruses than free chlorine or ClO2. It has the added
advantage of leaving no taste or odor problems. Although ozonation is widely used
in European water treatment facilities, it has the disadvantages of not forming a
protective residual in the treated water and being more expensive than chlorination.
The rate of inactivation of pathogens during disinfection is often modeled
using the Chick-Watson model or variations of it. The model predicts the change in

300

Water Quality Control

the pathogen concentration, N (number of pathogens/unit volume), with time as
r(N) =

dN
= - kC nN
dt

(19)

where C is the concentration of disinfectant, n is an empirical constant called the
coefficient of dilution, and k is an empirical rate constant called the coefficient of
specific lethality. For many cases, the model can be simplified and still works well if
the coefficient of dilution is taken as 1.0. The coefficient of specific lethality is a
function of the particular pathogen target, particular disinfectant being used, temperature, and pH. Sometimes (19) is expressed as a first-order reduction of pathogen
concentration by assuming C n is constant and lumping k and C n into a single rate
constant, k*, as
r(N) =

dN
= - k*N

EXAMPLE 3 Giardia Inactivation by Ozone
Because of the purity of its groundwater source, a water utility only has to disinfect the water before delivery. The utility uses ozone as its primary disinfectant
and treats 10 MGD (million gallons per day) of water. The ozone is bubbled into
the water as it passes sequentially through the four chambers of a disinfectant
contact tank (see Figure 8). Each chamber of the tank is well mixed, holds 50,000
gallons of water, and receives the same ozone dose. As discussed earlier in Section 3,
EPA requires that the Giardia concentration be reduced to 1兾1,000 of its initial concentration (referred to as 3-log reduction). What is the minimum ozone concentration that must be used to achieve the required removal of Giardia? The
coefficient of specific lethality and coefficient of dilution for ozone inactivation of
Giardia under these conditions are 1.8 L # mg-1 # min-1 and 1.0, respectively.

Solution We need to do a mass balance on the tank in terms of the Giardia
concentration, but the tank as a whole is not well modeled as a continuous stirred

tank reactor (CSTR) or a plug flow reactor (PFR). However, because each chamber is well mixed and the effluent of one chamber is the influent of the next, we
can model the system as a series of CSTRs. First we develop an equation for a series of steady state CSTRs in which the volume Vc, the residence time uc, the flow
rate Q, and the ozone concentration C, are the same in each CSTR. We make this
derivation general to any series of CSTRs in which first-order decay is occurring
by using (20) as the reaction rate expression and later substituting the product of
k (the specific lethality coefficient) and Cn in place of k*. Using (1.23) and (20),
the steady state mass balance around the first chamber is
0 = QN0 - QN1 - Vk*N1
Solving for N1 gives
N1 =

QN0
Q + Vk*

Remembering that uc = Vc >Q, and rearranging yields

(25)

For the particular case of the ozone contact tank’s four chambers (m = 4), the

ozone concentration in each chamber as

Hardness and Alkalinity
The presence of multivalent cations, most notably calcium and magnesium ions, is
referred to as water hardness. Groundwater is especially prone to excessive hardness. Hardness causes two distinct problems. First, the reaction between hardness
and soap produces a sticky, gummy deposit called “soap curd” (the ring around the
bathtub). Essentially all home cleaning activities, from bathing and grooming to
dishwashing and laundering, are made more difficult with hard water.
Although the introduction of synthetic detergents has decreased but not eliminated the impact of hardness on cleaning, the second problem, that of scaling,
remains significant. When hard water is heated, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and
magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) readily precipitate out of solution, forming a
rock-like scale that clogs hot water pipes and reduces the efficiency of water heaters,
boilers, and heat exchangers. Pipes filled with scale must ultimately be replaced,
usually at great expense. Heating equipment that has scaled up not only transmits
heat less readily, thus increasing fuel costs, but also is prone to failure at a much earlier time. For both of these reasons, if hardness is not controlled at the water treatment plant itself, many individuals and industrial facilities find it worth the expense
to provide their own water softening.
Hardness is defined as the concentration of all multivalent metallic cations in
solution, including iron (Fe2 + ), manganese (Mn2 + ), strontium (Sr2 + ), and aluminum
(Al3 + ). However, the principal ions causing hardness in natural water are calcium
(Ca2 + ) and magnesium (Mg2 + ), so typically hardness can be operationally defined
as the sum of only Ca2 + and Mg2 + .
It is conventional practice to calculate hardness (as well as alkalinity) using the
concepts of equivalents and equivalent weights. Chemists in the eighteenth century
noted, for example, that 8 g of oxygen combine with 1 g of hydrogen (to form H2O),
while 3 g of carbon combine with 1 g of hydrogen (to form CH4). They inferred
from this that 8 g of oxygen ought to combine with 3 g of carbon (which it does in
CO2). In this example, the equivalent weight (EW) of oxygen would be 8 g, and that
of carbon would be 3 g, and 1 EW of oxygen would combine with 1 EW of carbon
(to form CO2). This idea of equivalents, when first proposed, was not taken very seriously because it is complicated by the fact that individual elements can have more
than one value for their equivalent weight, depending on the reaction in question
(e.g., carbon forms CO as well as CO2). However, with the understanding of the
structure of the atom that came later, it regained favor as a convenient method of
handling certain chemical computations.
The equivalent weight of a substance is its atomic or molecular weight divided
by a number, n, that relates to its valence or ionic charge. For the reactions of interest in hardness and alkalinity calculations, n is simply the ionic charge. For neutral

303

Water Quality Control

compounds, it is the number of hydrogen ions that would be required to replace the
cation:
Equivalent weight (EW) =

Atomic or molecular weight

(27)

n

Thus, for example, to find the EW of CaCO3, we note it would take two hydrogen
ions to replace the cation (Ca2 + ). Its EW is therefore
EWCaCO3 =

(40 + 12 + 3 * 16)
100
=
= 50g/eq = 50 mg/meq
2
2

(28)

where (mg/meq) are the units of milligrams per milliequivalent. For the calcium ion
itself (Ca2 + ), which has an atomic weight of 40.1 and a charge of 2, the equivalent
weight is
EWCa2 + =

40.1
L 20.0 mg/meq
2

Table 3 lists the equivalent weights for a number of common chemicals important in
water hardness calculations.
In measuring hardness, the concentrations of the multivalent cations are
expressed as either meq/L using the following expression
meq/L of X =

concentration of X(mg/L)
EW of X(mg/meq)

or alternatively, as mg/L as CaCO3 by the equation
mg/L of X as CaCO3 =

concentration of X (mg/L) * 50.0 mg CaCO3/meq
EW of X (mg/meq)

(30)

The following example shows how to work with these units.
EXAMPLE 4 Expressing the Concentration of Hardness
A sample of groundwater has 100 mg/L of Ca2 + and 10 mg/L of Mg2 + . Express
its hardness in units of meq/L and mg/L as CaCO3.
Solution Using (29) and Table 3, the contribution of calcium in meq/L is
100 mg/L
20.0 mg/meq

= 5.0 meq/L

Using (30), the calcium concentration in mg/L as CaCO3 is
(100 mg/L)(50.0 mg CaCO3/meq)
= 250 mg/L as CaCO3
(20.0 mg/meq)
Similarly the Mg2 + hardness is calculated as 0.82 meq/L and 41.0 mg/L as CaCO3.
The water’s hardness is
5.0 meq/L + 0.82 meq/L = 5.8 meq/L
or,
(250.0 + 41.0) mg/L as CaCO3 = 291 mg/L as CaCO3
Although there are no absolute distinctions, and public acceptance of hardness
is dependent on the past experiences of individual consumers, the qualitative classification of hardness given in Table 4 is often used. Hardness above about 150 mg/L
as CaCO3 is noticed by most people.
Another important characteristic of water is its alkalinity, which is a measure
of the water’s capability to absorb hydrogen ions without significant pH change.
That is, alkalinity is a measure of the acid buffering capacity of water. In most
natural water, the total amount of H + that can be neutralized is dominated by the

alkalinity provided by the carbonate buffering system. Thus, alkalinity is operationally defined as
+
Alkalinity (mol/L) = [HCO3- ] + 2[CO23 ] + [OH ] - [H ]

(31)

where concentrations in [ ] denote units of mol/L. Notice that the concentration of
carbonate [CO23 - ] in (31) is multiplied by 2, because each carbonate ion can neutralize two H + ions. This assumes the concentrations are being measured in molarity
units (mol/L). Often, the concentrations are measured in terms of equivalents, or in
mg/L as CaCO3, in which case the 2 is already accounted for in the conversions, so
the concentrations are added directly and
+
Alkalinity (meq/L) = (HCO3- ) + (CO23 ) + (OH ) - (H )

(32)

where the quantities in ( ) are concentrations in meq/L or mg/L as CaCO3.
The following example demonstrates these alkalinity calculations.

EXAMPLE 5 Calculating Alkalinity
A sample of water at pH 10 has 32.0 mg/L of CO23 . Find the alkalinity as CaCO3.
Solution The EW of carbonate is given in Table 3 as 30 mg/meq. Converting
32.0 mg/L of carbonate into mg/L as CaCO3 gives
(CO23 ) = 32.0 mg/L *

1
* 50.0 mg CaCO3/meq
30.0 mg/meq

= 53.3 mg/L as CaCO3
Equilibrium between carbonate and bicarbonate is reached very rapidly, so the
concentration of bicarbonate can be calculated knowing that concentrations in
equilibrium expressions must be expressed in mol/L:

[HCO3-] =

= 1.140 mmol/L (33)
K2
4.68 * 10-11
Because the ionic charge of bicarbonate is 1, 1.14 mmol/L HCO3- equals
1.14 meq/L HCO3-. Therefore, the concentration of bicarbonate in mg/L as
CaCO3 is
(HCO3-) = a

1.140 meq 50 mg CaCO3
b = 57.0 mg/L as CaCO3

The pH is 10, so [H + ] = 1 * 10-10 mol/L, and its EW is 1 mg/meq, so it is
(H + ) = 1 * 10-10 mol/L * 1 g/mol *
= 5.0 * 10-6 mg/L as CaCO3

306

103 mg/g
1 mg/meq

* 50.0 mg CaCO3/meq

Water Quality Control

Because [H + ][OH-] = 1 * 10-14, then [OH-] = 1 * 10-4 mol/L. The hydroxyl
concentration is therefore
103 mg/g
(OH-) = 1 * 10-4 mol/L * 17.0 g/mol *
* 50.0 mg CaCO3 >meq
17.0 mg/meq
= 5.0 mg/L as CaCO3
Total alkalinity, then, is just (CO23 - ) + (HCO3-) + (OH-) - (H + )
Alkalinity = 53.3 + 57.0 + 5.0 - 5.0 * 10-6 = 115.3 mg/L as CaCO3
For nearly neutral water (pH between 6 and 8.5), the concentrations of (H + ) and
(OH ) are very small. In this same pH range, the bicarbonate/carbonate equilibrium
strongly favors bicarbonate
(34)
Alkalinity (meq/L) = (HCO3-) for 6 … pH … 8.5
Understanding the nature of both hardness and alkalinity is important to be able
to understand water softening. In fact, how the components of hardness are defined is
a combination of the concepts of hardness and alkalinity. As noted earlier, the total
hardness (TH) is the sum of individual hardness components
(35)
Total Hardness = Ca2 + + Mg2 +
where it has been assumed in (35) that calcium and magnesium are the only two
multivalent cations with appreciable concentrations. To understand water softening,
it also is useful to separate total hardness, into two components: carbonate hardness
(CH), associated with the anions HCO3- and CO23 , and noncarbonate hardness
(NCH) associated with other anions. If the concentration of HCO3- plus CO23
equals or exceeds the total hardness (in essence, alkalinity exceeds TH), then
CH = TH and NCH = 0. On the other hand, if alkalinity is less than TH, then
CH = alkalinity and there is also some NCH which equals TH - CH. CH is especially important since it leads to scaling, as the following reaction suggests:
-

Ca2 + + 2HCO3- 4 CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O
bicarbonate

(36)

calcium
carbonate

CH is sometimes referred to as “temporary hardness” because it can be removed by
simply heating the water. The carbonate and noncarbonate hardness components
can be further subdivided into the calcium and magnesium components of each.
These subdivisions of hardness are illustrated in the following example and are
important in understanding water softening in the next section.

Find the total hardness (TH), the carbonate hardness (CH), the noncarbonate
hardness (NCH), and the alkalinity, all expressed as CaCO3. Find the total dissolved solids (TDS) in mg/L.
Solution It is helpful to set up a table in which each of the concentrations can
be expressed in terms of CaCO3 (or alternatively, meq). For Ca2 + , we get

As a first check on the accuracy of the chemical analysis, we can compare the sum
of the concentrations of cations and anions as CaCO3 (or as meq/L) to see if they
are nearly equal.
© cations = 200.0 + 123.0 + 156.5 + 7.7 = 487.2 mg/L as CaCO3
© anions = 140.8 + 209.4 + 135.2 = 485.4 mg/L as CaCO3
This is quite close. The difference would probably be associated with small concentrations of other ions as well as measurement error. Figure 9 depicts the ionic
composition of the water.
a. The total hardness is the sum of the multivalent cations, (Ca2 + ) and (Mg2 + ):
TH = 200.0 + 123.0 = 323.0 mg/L as CaCO3
So this is very hard water (Table 4).
b. The carbonate hardness is that portion of total hardness associated with
carbonates, which in this case is just bicarbonate HCO3- :
CH = 135.2 mg/L as CaCO3
In turn, the calcium carbonate hardness (Ca-CH), is the portion of the
calcium associated with CH. In this case, Ca-CH is 135.2 mg/L as CaCO3.
This may be most easily seen in the bar graph of the water’s composition
and components shown in Figure 9.
c. The NCH is the difference between the TH and the CH:
NCH = TH - CH = 323.0 - 135.2 = 187.8 mg/L as CaCO3

water contains calcium carbonate hardness (Ca-CH), calcium noncarbonate hardness
(Ca-NCH), and magnesium noncarbonate hardness (Mg-NCH), but no magnesium
carbonate hardness (Mg-CH). Concentrations are given as mg/L as CaCO3.

The calcium noncarbonate hardness (Ca-NCH) is the portion of the
calcium not associated with CH:
Ca-NCH = Ca - Ca-CH = 200.0 - 135.2 = 64.8 mg/L as CaCO3
And likewise, the magnesium noncarbonate hardness (Mg-NCH) is
Mg-NCH = TH - CH - Ca-NCH = 323 - 135.2 - 64.8
= 123.0 mg/L as CaCO3
d. Because the pH is nearly neutral, the concentrations of (H + ) and (OH-) are
negligible. Thus, the alkalinity is given by (34) as just the bicarbonate:
Alkalinity = (HCO3- ) = 135.2 mg/L as CaCO3
e. The total dissolved solids (TDS) is simply the sum of the cation and anion
concentrations expressed in mg/L:
TDS = 80 + 30 + 72 + 6 + 100 + 201 + 165 = 654 mg/L

It is usually very helpful to display the ionic constituents of water using a bar
graph such as that shown in Figure 9.

Softening
Hard water causes scaling of pipes and makes laundering more difficult, so many
water treatment plants provide water softening. Surface waters seldom have hardness levels above 200 mg/L as CaCO3, so softening is not usually part of the treatment process. For groundwater, however, where hardness levels are sometimes over
1,000 mg/L, it is quite common. There are two popular approaches to softening
water: the lime-soda ash process and the ion-exchange process. Either may be used
in a central treatment plant prior to distribution, but individual home units only use
the ion-exchange process.

309

Water Quality Control

In the lime-soda ash process, hydrated (slaked) lime (Ca(OH)2) is added to the
water, raising the pH to about 10.3. At this pH, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and
magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) are relatively insoluble, and most of the calcium
and magnesium ions precipitate out as these solids. Because of the strong
dependence of CaCO3 and Mg(OH)2 solubility on pH, lime-soda ash softening is
able to achieve the seemingly odd feat of reducing the calcium ion concentration in
water by adding calcium (as lime) to the water. The key is increasing the pH to
above 10, so there is a high enough concentration of hydroxide ions (OH - ) to
promote Mg(OH)2 precipitation and to provide sufficient carbonate, from a
combination of the water’s alkalinity and added soda ash (Na2CO3), to promote
CaCO3 precipitation. Five reactions describe how lime and soda ash addition
softens water. The first reaction raises the pH by overcoming the primary base
buffering component, dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2(aq)). CO2(aq) can equally
well be denoted as carbonic acid. The other four reactions describe how the various
components of hardness— Ca-CH, Mg-CH, Ca-NCH, and Mg-NCH—are
removed.
The five softening reactions are the following:
1. Removal of CO2(aq):
CO2(aq) + Ca(OH)2 4 CaCO3(s) + H2O

(37)

2. Removal of calcium carbonate hardness (Ca-CH):
Ca2 + + 2HCO3- + Ca(OH)2 4 2CaCO3(s) + 2H2O

(38)

3. Removal of magnesium carbonate hardness (Mg-CH):
Mg2 + + 2HCO3- + 2Ca(OH)2 4 2CaCO3(s) + Mg(OH)2(s) + 2H2O

(39)

4. Removal of calcium noncarbonate hardness (Ca-NCH):
Ca2 + + Na2CO3 4 CaCO3(s) + 2Na +

(40)

5. Removal of magnesium noncarbonate hardness (Mg-NCH):
Mg2 + + Ca(OH)2 + Na2CO3 4 CaCO3(s) + Mg(OH)2(s) + 2Na +

(41)

It has been found in practice that a modest excess of lime has to be added
beyond that accounted for in equations (37–41) to achieve the needed pH and good
softening. This excess varies between 20 and 40 mg/L as CaCO3 (0.4– 0.8 meq/L)
depending on the magnesium removal required, but for understanding the basics of
softening, we can assume the excess lime requirement to always be 20 mg/L as
CaCO3 (0.4 meq/L). Practically, precipitative softening can only reduce the hardness
of water down to about 40 mg/L as CaCO3 (0.8 meq/L).
EXAMPLE 7 Lime-Soda Ash Softening
A utility treats 12 MGD of the water in Example 6 to its maximum softness
before distribution.
a. How much lime and soda ash (in mg/L as CaCO3) must the utility add?
b. What mass of softening sludge will the plant generate daily?

310

Water Quality Control

Solution
a. To solve this problem, the first step is to calculate the amount of CO2(aq)
that must be neutralized. The water pH is 7.5, and its bicarbonate concentration was given in Example 6 as 165 mg/L (or 0.002705 M). Remembering to use molar units, we can calculate
[CO2(aq)] =

[HCO3-][H + ]
(0.002705 M)(10-7.5 M)
=
= 1.91 * 10-4 M
K1
4.47 * 10-7 M

which converts to a CO2(aq) concentration of 19.14 mg/L as CaCO3.
The second step is to draw a bar graph for the system like the one in
Figure 9, but abbreviated to only show the hardness components of
interest. Figure 10 shows the graph.
Based on the values in Figure 10 (and also calculated in Example 6) and
the carbonic acid concentration calculated previously, we set up Table 5 for
the components removed in the five water softening equations (37–41) and
fill in the first two columns of the table.
The rest of the table can now be completed. This is done row-by-row
by referring to the stoichiometry of the equation for that row. For instance
in the first row, (37) indicates 1 mg/L CaCO3 of lime is required for each
mg/L CaCO3 of CO2(aq) removed and, in turn, this produces 1 mg/L of
CaCO3(s). You can stoichiometrically equate concentrations of different
compounds such as CO2(aq), lime, and calcium carbonate solid, because
they have all been converted to the common basis of mg/L as CaCO3(s). For
(37), no soda ash is needed or Mg(OH)2(s) produced. Likewise, to complete
the Ca-CH row, (38) shows that to remove the 135 mg/L CaCO3 of Ca-CH,
an equal concentration of lime must be added, but the reaction will produce

double that concentration of CaCO3(s). After completing the rows for
equations (37) through (41), the 20 mg/L CaCO3 of excess lime that is
required is added to the lime column, and each column is summed to
quantify the total concentrations required or generated. This shows that the
treatment plant must add 297 mg/L CaCO3 of slaked lime and 188 mg/L
CaCO3 of soda ash to soften the water.
b. The calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide solids that are precipitated during softening are called softening sludges because, in fact, they are
very watery masses rather than solids in the normal sense of the word. A
softening sludge will typically have only about 5 percent solids and about
95 percent water. For this example, 477 mg/L CaCO3 of calcium carbonate
and 123 mg/L CaCO3 of magnesium hydroxide sludge were produced.
Thus, the mass concentration (rather than concentration as CaCO3) of
solids would be

This 24,900 kg ( ' 25 metric tons) is only the solids mass and, based on 5 percent solids in sludge, it will be accompanied by about 500 metric tons of
water. Almost always the sludge will be further processed and thickened to
decrease its water content before disposal. However, even after thickening,
the sludge will be from 50 to 85 percent water. Obviously, sludge handling
and disposal is a major concern in lime-soda ash softening.

312

Water Quality Control

After softening, the water is at a high pH and too corrosive to distribute without adjusting the pH back to near-neutral. Usually, this is done by recarbonation,
where CO2(g) is bubbled into the water. This not only decreases the pH but also adds
carbonate to the water, which may cause some residual calcium hardness to precipitate as calcium carbonate. Precipitative softening is actually a sequence of several of
the unit operations discussed earlier. The lime and soda ash are added and mixed in
a rapid mix tank, the calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide solids form in
what is basically a slowly agitated flocculation basin, the solids are removed in a
sedimentation basin, and, after recarbonation, the water is filtered to remove residual turbidity and particles that form during recarbonation.
The alternative to softening by precipitation uses an ion-exchange process.
The exchange process involves replacement of the unwanted ions in solution with
ions of a different species that are attached to an insoluble resin. The ion-exchange
process can be used to remove nitrate ions, metal ions, and other contaminant ions
as well as the ions responsible for hardness. Laboratory quality deionized water is
obtained in this way, but the processing required to obtain such high-quality water
is too expensive to use in municipal treatment plants.
In the ion-exchange process, hard water flows through a column containing
solid resin beads. The resins were originally made of naturally occurring clays called
zeolites but are now nearly always synthetically produced. In an ion-exchange
unit, the resin removes Ca2 + and Mg2 + ions from the water and replaces them with
sodium ions, which form soluble salts. Using Ca(HCO3)2 as an example, the reaction can be represented as
Ca(HCO3)2 + Na2R 4 CaR + 2NaHCO3

(42)

(HCO3-)

where R represents the solid ion-exchange resin. The alkalinity
remains unchanged. The sodium salts that are formed do not cause hardness, but the dissolved
sodium ions remain in the treated water and may be harmful to individuals with
heart problems.
The hardness removal is essentially 100 percent effective as long as the ionexchange resin has sodium remaining. When the sodium is depleted, the ionexchange bed must be regenerated by removing it from service and backwashing it
with a solution of concentrated NaCl, forming new Na2R. The wastewater produced during regeneration must be properly disposed of because it contains a high
concentration of chloride, sodium, and other cations. The regeneration reaction
involving Ca2 + can be represented as
CaR + 2NaCl 4 Na2R + CaCl2

(43)

The ion-exchange process can be used in wastewater treatment as well as
water treatment. In such cases, the process can enable recovery of valuable chemicals for reuse or harmful ones for disposal. It is, for example, often used to recover
chromic acid from metal finishing waste for reuse in chrome-plating baths. It is even
used for the removal of radioactivity.

being employed in one form or another to address nearly all contaminants in water,
including pathogens, hardness and dissolved solids, organics and disinfectant
byproduct precursors, metals, and suspended particles. Generically, all membranes
can be considered semipermeable physical barriers because they allow the passage of
water and, to a greater or lesser degree, some water constituents, while stopping or
severely restricting the permeation of other water constituents. The purified water is
called the permeate, and the influent water for treatment is called the feed. All membrane processes generate an aqueous wastestream, called the concentrate (or
retentate), which contains the rejected contaminants. Traditionally, membranes have
been classified as microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis,
based roughly on the minimum size of the contaminant that is excluded from passing through the particular membrane (Figure 11). As the size of the contaminant excluded becomes smaller, the membrane is said to become “tighter.”
As the variety of membranes has increased, the traditional classifications have
become blurred, and now, for instance, one manufacturer may list a loose ultrafiltration membrane for the same removal of viruses as another manufacturer’s tight
microfiltration membrane. A more intuitive classification is based on whether the
membrane is designed to reject particles, including pathogens, or dissolved
substances, including salts and hardness. Particulate separation processes include
microfiltration and ultrafiltration, whereas solute (dissolved substance) separation
processes include nanofiltration and reverse osmosis. Most particulate separation
membranes are constructed as hollow fibers with thousands of fibers in a single pressure vessel. The fibers are typically between 0.5 and 2.0 mm outside diameter. The
water may be forced through the fiber wall from the feed on the inside to the permeate space on the outside (an “inside-out” flow) or from feed water on the outside
of the fiber to a permeate channel in the center of the fiber (an “outside-in” flow). The

314

Water Quality Control

particles that accumulate on the feed side of the membrane must be periodically
cleaned away by backwashing the module. In contrast, most solute separation membranes are configured as layered sheets of membranes, which are wrapped in a spiral
wound configuration. The channels between the sheets alternate between high pressure feed, and low pressure permeate channels, and the water is purified as it is forced
through the membrane from the feed to the permeate channel.
Both particle and solute separation membrane performance is quantified by
two primary criteria: contaminant rejection and water recovery. Rejection, R, quantifies the fraction of the target contaminant that is retained in the concentrate as
R = 1 -

CP
CF

(44)

where CP is the concentration of the contaminant in the permeate stream, and CF is
its concentration in the feed stream. Because particle separation membranes may
often reduce the contaminant concentration by many orders of magnitude, the
rejection may also be quantified as a log value,
Rlog = -log(1 - R) = -loga

CP
CF
b = loga b
CF
CP

(45)

It is not uncommon for particle separation membranes used for disinfection to
achieve over 5-log rejection of viruses and cysts, whereas solute separation membranes typically achieve no better than 99 percent rejection of salts and hardness.
Because all membrane processes generate an aqueous wastestream, the recovery, or fraction of the feed flow that becomes permeate flow, is often of critical importance. The recovery, r, is defined as
r =

QP
QF

(46)

where QP is the permeate flow rate, and QF is the feed flow rate.
Recovery for loose, particle separation membranes is typically greater than 95 percent and often as high as 98 percent, whereas solute separation membranes seldom
achieve better than 90 percent recovery. The small, under-the-sink reverse osmosis
units that are now used in many U.S. homes often have recoveries of 50 percent or less!
In the 1960s, desalination of seawater and low-quality, brackish water was
optimistically viewed as an answer to growing shortages of potable fresh water, and
advances in reverse osmosis were considered a key to achieving this goal. The alternative to membrane desalination is thermal distillation, which is based on the fact that
salts do not evaporate with water. Thus, if water can be boiled and the vapor condensed, the vapor will be pure water. About 40 percent of the desalination capacity in
the world is by thermal distillation, although most of the production is concentrated
in oil-rich Middle Eastern nations because thermal processes are relatively energy
intensive (Cooley et al., 2006). In 2005, in the United States, over 90 percent of the
desalination capacity was based on membrane processes (Cooley et al., 2006), and it
is expected that membranes will account for an increasing share of the world desalination capacity as energy costs rise faster than membrane production costs. However,
by 2005, desalination still produced much less than 1 percent of both the world’s and
the U.S. total freshwater consumption. This is not to say that desalination, and membrane desalination in particular, will not continue to see widespread growth and

play an important role in providing safe potable water in many water short areas;
however, it is unlikely that it will provide a large fraction of the world’s total freshwater demand in the near future. Cooley et al. (2006) summarize this situation well
when they write, “The potential benefits of ocean desalination are great, but the economic, cultural, and environmental costs of wide commercialization remain high.”

Wastewater Treatment
Municipal wastewater is typically over 99.9 percent water. The characteristics of the
remaining portion vary somewhat from city to city, with the variation depending
primarily on inputs from industrial facilities that mix with the somewhat predictable
composition of residential flows. Given the almost limitless combinations of chemicals found in wastewater, it is too difficult to list them individually. Instead, they are
often described by a few general categories, as has been done in Table 6.
In Table 6, a distinction is made between total dissolved solids (TDS) and
suspended solids (SS). The sum of the two is total solids (TS). The suspended solids
portion is, by definition, the portion of total solids that can be removed by a
membrane filter (having a pore size of about 1.7 mm). The remainder (TDS) that
cannot be filtered includes dissolved solids, colloidal solids, and very small suspended particles.
Wastewater treatment plants are usually designated as providing primary,
secondary, or advanced treatment, depending on the degree of purification. Primary
treatment plants utilize physical processes, such as screening, skimming, and sedimentation, to remove pollutants that are settleable, floatable, or too large to pass through
simple screening devices. Primary treatment typically removes about 35 percent of the
BOD and 60 percent of the suspended solids. In the early 1970s, the sewage of about
50 million people in the United States was receiving no better treatment than this.
While the most visibly objectionable substances are removed in primary treatment,
and some degree of safety is normally provided by disinfection after primary treatment, the effluent still has enough BOD to cause oxygen depletion problems and
enough nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, to accelerate eutrophication.
The Clean Water Act (CWA), in essence, requires at least secondary treatment
for all publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) by stipulating that such facilities
provide at least 85 percent BOD removal (with possible case-by-case variances that
allow lower percentages for marine discharges). This translates into an effluent

requirement of 30 mg/L for both 5-day BOD and suspended solids (monthly average). In secondary treatment plants, the physical processes that make up primary
treatment are augmented with processes that involve the microbial oxidation of
wastes. Such biological treatment mimics nature by utilizing microorganisms to
oxidize the organics, with the advantage being that the oxidation can be done under
controlled conditions in the treatment plant itself, rather than in the receiving body
of water. When properly designed and operated, secondary treatment plants remove
about 90 percent of the BOD and 90 percent of the suspended solids.
Although the main purpose of primary treatment (in addition to disinfecting
the wastes) is to remove objectionable solids, and the principal goal of secondary
treatment is to remove most of the BOD, neither is effective at removing nutrients,
dissolved material (metals, salts), or biologically resistant (refractory) substances.
For example, typically no more than half of the nitrogen and one-third of the phosphorus are removed during secondary treatment. This means the effluent can still be
a major contributor to eutrophication problems. In circumstances where either the
raw sewage has particular pollutants of concern or the receiving body of water is
especially sensitive, so-called advanced treatment (previously called tertiary treatment) may be required. In many parts of the United States, advanced nutrient removal is now required in POTWs. Advanced treatment processes are varied and
specialized, depending on the nature of the pollutants that must be removed. In
most circumstances, advanced treatment follows primary and secondary treatment,
although in some cases, especially in the treatment of industrial waste, it may completely replace those conventional processes.
An example flow diagram for a wastewater treatment plant that provides
primary and secondary treatment is illustrated in Figure 12.

Water Quality Control

Primary Treatment
As suggested in Figure 12, primary treatment begins with simple screening.
Screening removes large floating objects such as rags, sticks, old shoes, and whatever else is present that might otherwise damage the pumps or clog small pipes.
Screens vary but typically consist of parallel steel bars spaced anywhere from 2 cm
to 7 cm apart, perhaps followed by a wire mesh screen with smaller openings. One
way to avoid the problem of disposal of materials collected on screens is to use a
device called a comminuter, which grinds those coarse materials into small enough
pieces that they can be left right in the wastewater flow.
After screening, the wastewater passes into a grit chamber where it is held for
up to a few minutes. The detention time (the tank volume divided by the flow rate)
is chosen to be long enough to allow sand, grit, and other heavy material to settle
out, but is too short to allow lighter, organic materials to settle. Detention times are
typically 20 to 30 s (seconds). By collecting only these heavier materials, the disposal
problem is simplified because those materials are usually nonoffensive and can be
easily disposed of in a landfill.
From the grit chamber, the sewage passes to a primary settling tank (also
known as a sedimentation basin or a primary clarifier) where the flow’s speed is reduced sufficiently to allow most of the suspended solids to settle out by gravity.
Detention times of approximately 1.5 to 3 hours are typical, resulting in the removal
of from 50 to 65 percent of the suspended solids and 25 to 40 percent of the BOD.
Primary settling tanks are either round or rectangular, and their behavior is similar
to that of the clarifiers described earlier in this chapter for water treatment facilities.
The solids that settle, called primary sludge or raw sludge, are removed for further
processing, as is the grease and scum that floats to the top of the tank. If this is just
a primary treatment plant, the effluent at this point is disinfected (typically by chlorine or UV light) to destroy bacteria and help control odors. Then it is released.
As described for water treatment, sizing of primary settling tanks (clarifiers)
is based primarily on the overflow rate and the detention time. These parameters have
been found to be the key determinants of successful performance. High-rate clarifiers
have been used in Europe for several decades and are now starting to be used in U.S.
POTWs, as the cost and availability of land becomes more restrictive (Tchobanoglous
et al., 2003). By addition of various coagulants and ballast (additives such as sand
that make the settling particles more dense) and specialized settling equipment within
the clarifier, wastewater particles can be made to settle more rapidly, so the same
particle removal efficiency can be achieved at a higher overflow rate. The range of
overflow rates, no, for high-rate clarification is 1,000–3,000 m3 # m - 2 # d - 1, compared to 30–100 m3 # m - 2 # d - 1 for conventional clarification. Example 8 illustrates
how significantly high-rate clarification can decrease the required clarifier size.
EXAMPLE 8 Sizing a Primary Clarifier
A town of 30,000 sends 0.5 m3 of wastewater per person per day to the wastewater treatment plant. A conventional circular primary clarifier would be
designed to have an average detention time of 2.0 hours and an average overflow
rate of 40 m/d, whereas a high-rate clarifier would have an average overflow rate
of 1,500 m/d.

Solution

a. At 0.5 m3/person/d, the daily flow for 30,000 people would be 15,000 m3/d.
The overflow rate, no, is defined by (7), so the clarifier surface area is
Ab =

40 m3 # m-2 # d-1

The tank diameter is therefore

p

The detention time (9), u, is the ratio of volume to flow rate, and the
volume is area times depth, so the clarifier depth is
Qu
15,000 m3/d * 2.0 h
Db = A =
= 3.3 m
b
375 m2 * 24 h/d
As it turns out, this depth is about the minimum that would be considered
good design practice.
b. Repeating (7) for the high-rate clarifier case,
Ab =

Q
15,000 m3 # d-1
=
= 10 m2
no
1,500 m3 # m-2 # d-1

Thus, the high-rate clarifier would use about 3% of the land area as the
conventional clarifier. In reality, the area savings would not be as large as
this, because some additional area would be needed for the coagulant/
ballast dosing equipment and for a possible flocculation tank.
Maximum flow rates over weirs per lineal meter of weir, minimum depths of
tanks, constraints related to hour-to-hour flow variations, as well as seasonal variations, and so forth, complicate the design of an actual clarifier, so Example 8 is
merely a first cut at specifying the tankage needed.

Secondary (Biological) Treatment
The main purpose of secondary treatment is to provide additional BOD and suspended solids removal, beyond what is achievable by simple sedimentation. There
are two commonly used approaches, both of which take advantage of the ability of
microorganisms to convert organic wastes into stabilized, low-energy compounds.
In the first approach, suspended growth treatment, the microorganisms are suspended in and move with the water. In contrast, the microorganisms in attached
growth treatment processes are fixed on a stationary surface, and the water flows
past the microorganisms, much like the water passes by the media in a drinking

319

Water Quality Control

water treatment filter. There are many different configurations and variations of
each approach, and the most common type of each will be discussed later. However,
to understand the functioning of secondary treatment processes, the basics of microbial kinetics must first be understood.

Microbial Kinetics
The rate of consumption of BOD is the primary rate of interest in secondary treatment. The organic matter that microorganisms consume is generically called
substrate, and it is normally measured as mg/L of BOD. Kinetics are also important
in terms of the mass of organisms, which may increase or decrease with time,
depending on the growth conditions and availability of substrate. Rather than try to
quantify the number concentration of the very diverse community of microbes in a
bioreactor, they are normally estimated using a surrogate measure such as mg/L of
volatile suspended solids (VSS) or mg/L volatile solids (VS). The term volatile arises
from the analytic technique used, which measures the difference in mass of solids in
a known volume of water between that weighed after drying at 105°C and after
burning off at 500°C. Although VSS and VS contain more than just the viable mass
of microbes, they are simple to measure and have been found to provide a reasonable first approximation of the microorganism concentration. Thus, the kinetic
analysis of a bioreactor involves, at a minimum, three mass balances, which quantify the flow and changes in water, substrate, and microbe mass. However, these
mass balances are interrelated. The rate of substrate entering and leaving the reactor is affected by the water rate entering and leaving, and the rate of microbial
growth is affected by changes in the mass of substrate available.
During the exponential phase of microbial growth, the increase in the microbial mass growth rate, rg, can be modeled by the first-order rate expression
rg =

dX
= mX
dt

(47)

where X is the concentration of microorganisms (typically mg VSS/L), and m is the
specific biomass growth rate constant (time-1). As you would expect, the growth
rate constant is dependent on the availability of substrate. Monod (1949) reasoned
that when the substrate concentration is zero, then the growth rate constant should
be zero, and when there is substrate in excess, the microbial growth rate should
reach a maximum that is determined by the maximum speed at which microbes can
reproduce. Figure 13 shows this dependence of the growth rate constant on the substrate concentration, S. The Monod equation expresses it mathematically as
m =

mmS
(Ks + S)

(48)

where mm is the maximum specific growth rate (time-1), S is the substrate concentration (typically, mg BOD5 >L), and Ks is the half velocity constant. Ks is defined as the
substrate concentration when the growth rate constant is half of its maximum value
(mm). Based on (47) and (48), the microbial mass growth rate can be expressed:
rg =

Substrate concentration

FIGURE 13 The Monod equation empirically describes the dependence of the biomass
growth rate constant on the substrate concentration.

Not only does the rate of microbial growth depend on the substrate concentration, but also the amount of microbial mass generated should be proportional to the
amount of substrate consumed. In other words, for a particular substrate and set of
growth conditions, a certain proportion of the substrate mass consumed should be
converted into a predictable amount of new microbial cell mass. The proportionality constant is the yield coefficient, Y, and has the units of mg VSS/mg BOD5.
Microbes derive energy for new cell synthesis and normal metabolism by catalyzing
oxidation-reduction reactions. The fraction of the substrate that becomes microbial
mass depends on the particular biochemical transformation that takes place and is
the subject of the study of bioenergetics (McCarty, 1971). For instance, if glucose (a
simple sugar substrate) is microbially oxidized by reducing oxygen (O2) rather than
by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2), about ten times more cell mass is synthesized per
gram of glucose consumed based on values from McCarty (1971, 1975). The yield
coefficient relates the rate of substrate consumption (rsu) under particular conditions
to the rate of microbe growth:
rsu =

-rg
dS
=
dt
Y

(50)

The maximum specific growth rate, mm, is related by the yield coefficient to the
maximum specific substrate utilization constant, k:
k =

mm
Y

(51)

Combining the previous three equations, the substrate utilization rate is expressed as
rsu =

-mmXS
dS
- kXS

=
dt
Y(Ks + S)
(Ks + S)

(52)

We have made one simplification that cannot be overlooked. In (47) and (49),
we assumed that all of the microbes in the population would continue to reproduce.

This is akin to assuming there is a birth rate but no death rate. The death rate for
microbes, rd, should also be a first-order process but now with a negative reaction
term.
rd =

where kd is the endogenous decay (death) rate constant (time-1). The net or observed rate of change of microbe concentration, r¿g, is

(54)

Using (54) and (50) gives a very useful expression:
r¿g = - Yrsu - kdX

(55)

(54) tells us the reaction rate in a mass balance equation on microbe mass is the difference between the rate they are generated (49) and the rate they die (53). Similarly,
(55) states that the reaction rate for microbial growth is proportional to the rate that
substrate is consumed (rsu) minus the rate microbes die (rd). Table 7 provides ranges
and typical values for the microbial kinetic parameters that have been measured in
wastewater treatment bioreactors.

If the microbes in the pond consume the inflowing biodegradable organic matter
according to typical kinetics, determine:

b. The biodegradable organic matter removal efficiency of the pond
c. The concentration of volatile suspended solids leaving the pond
Solution The pond can be modeled as a steady state CSTR because it is wellmixed and, we’ll assume, the stream flow has been at a steady flow rate and composition for a long period.
a. First, set up a mass balance on the microbial mass using the pond as the
control volume. From the variables in Figure 14, we can write
0 = QXo - QXf + Vr¿g
Substituting in (54) and recognizing that Xo = 0, Xf = X, and Sf = S for a
CSTR leads to
0 = - QX + V

This can be solved algebraically for the substrate concentration to give

It is important to note that the effluent substrate concentration, (57), is not
a function of the influent substrate concentration and, interestingly, it was
derived from a microbial mass balance, rather than a substrate mass
balance. Using the default values in Table 7 and u = 200 m3/50 m3/d =

It is worth remembering that the BOD5 in the outflowing creek is underestimated substantially because much of the microbial mass generated could actually be
used as substrate by other predatory microbes and, in fact, cause a significant oxygen demand. The BOD5 removal efficiency calculated is based only on the decrease
in the original quantity of biodegradable organic matter entering the pond and
doesn’t account for the organic matter synthesized in the pond.

Suspended Growth Treatment
The mathematical expressions just described allow us to quantify the rate that microbes grow and consume BOD. These can now be applied to understanding and
designing the various biological reactors that are employed in secondary wastewater
treatment. Most modern plants employ some form of suspended growth bioreactor
in which the microbes are freely suspended in the water as it is treated. The following section describes the two most widely used suspended growth processes, activated sludge and aerated lagoons, and one recently introduced suspended growth
process, membrane bioreactors, which is rapidly gaining acceptance, particularly in
densely populated urban areas.
Activated Sludge. The most commonly employed type of suspended growth
process is activated sludge. There are many variations of the activated sludge
process, but all have two things in common: they depend on injection of extra oxygen into the reactor, and they artificially increase the microbial mass in the reactor
by separating out and returning back to the activated sludge tank a large portion of
the microbial cells in the reactor effluent. Oxygen is injected into the bioreactor by
diffusers, somewhat like the bubblers used in home aquariums. The oxygen maintains aerobic (oxygenated) conditions, which facilitates rapid microbial decomposition of organic matter and agitates the mixture of wastewater and microbial cells.
This promotes thorough mixing of the substrate with the microbes and maintains
the entire mass in suspension. The mixture of aerated water and microbial mass is
called the mixed liquor.

FIGURE 15 Control volume and parameter definitions used for analysis of an activated
sludge wastewater treatment process.

As shown in Figures 12 and 15, the activated sludge process is, at least, two
unit operations: the activated sludge bioreactor and the secondary clarifier. Because
the microbial cells generated in the activated sludge reactor are particles, they can be
separated from the water by sedimentation. This is done in the secondary clarifier.
Much of the cell mass that is settled out in the clarifier is returned to the bioreactor
via the return activated sludge (RAS) line (Figure 15). However, to maintain a steady
state concentration in the bioreactor, a portion must also be wasted through a waste
activated sludge (WAS) line to compensate for the new cell mass being synthesized in
the activated sludge tank. Because more cell mass than water is recycled, the average
cell retention time is longer than the average hydraulic retention time in an activated sludge process. The assumption is normally made that all of the BOD consumption occurs in the bioreactor, so the hydraulic retention time is defined as u = V>Q
(Figure 15). The average cell retention time (which is also known as solids retention
time, SRT, or sludge age), uc, is
uc =

VX
VX
L
QeXe + QwXw
QwXw

(61)

The simplifying approximation shown in (61) is often made based on the assumption that the secondary clarifier is very effective at settling out VSS, so Xe L 0. In
addition to the sludge age, another important, related design and operational
parameter is the food to microbe ratio, F兾M:
F>M =

QS0
VX

(62)

The cell retention time, uc, and the F兾M are related and depend largely on the activated sludge wastage rate from the WAS line (Figure 15). If the F>M is too high
(meaning also that uc is too low) because cells are being wasted too rapidly, then the
BOD removal efficiency will be low. In contrast, if cells are wasted too slowly (low
F兾M, long uc), then the microbes will be starved, and the process will be inefficient
in terms of energy needed to aerate the mixed liquor and recycle microbes from the
secondary clarifier.
Table 8 gives typical values for sludge age and F兾M ratio for POTWs treating
municipal wastewater.

By allowing greater contact between microorganisms and wastewater in a
given volume of space, activated sludge tanks can take up considerably less land
area for equivalent performance compared to the attached growth processes described later. They are also less expensive to construct than trickling filters, have
fewer problems with flies and odors, and can achieve higher rates of BOD removal.
They do, however, require more expertise to operate and more energy for pumps
and blowers, and hence have higher operating costs. Figure 16 shows representative
values of BOD, suspended solids, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus as wastewater passes through primary sedimentation, biological aeration (e.g., activated
sludge treatment), and secondary settling.
Membrane Bioreactors. Since the mid-1990s, microfiltration membranes have
been employed in suspended growth bioreactors to decrease the size of secondary
treatment tankage and improve the suspended solids separation efficiency. These
membrane biological reactors (MBRs) draw water from the mixed liquor into hollow fiber membranes submerged in the activated sludge aeration tank, thus avoiding
the need for a secondary clarifier in the conventional activated sludge process. The
microfiltration fibers have a pore size of about 0.2 mm, so they are very effective in
producing low TSS effluent. (See the section, “Membrane Processes,” earlier in this
chapter for more discussion of membrane separation processes.) Because MBRs
exclude nearly all microbial cells from the secondary effluent, some of the activated

326

Water Quality Control

sludge mixed liquor must be continuously bled off of the aeration tank by a waste
activated sludge line to maintain the desired mixed liquor concentration. The very
efficient removal of bacteria and cysts (but not so much viruses) makes MBRs
attractive in systems where wastewater reuse and reclamation is desired. As you
might expect, avoiding fouling of the membrane fibers is one of the biggest engineering challenges with MBRs. Although different MBR vendors employ different, often
proprietary, processes, commonly fouling control involves a combination of bursts
of bubbles injected immediately below the hollow fibers, frequent backwashing by
inside-out flushes of clean water, and periodic chemical cleaning of the fibers. In addition to fouling problems, MBRs are more expensive both to build and to operate
than most other treatment options, and because they are a new process innovation,
there is little data on how long they will last or how frequently the costly membranes
may need replacement.
Aerated Lagoons and Oxidation Ponds. Oxidation ponds are large, shallow
ponds, typically 1 to 2 m deep, where raw or primary treated sewage is decomposed
by microorganisms. The conditions are similar to those that prevail in a eutrophic
lake. Oxidation ponds can be designed to maintain aerobic conditions throughout,
but more often, the decomposition taking place near the surface is aerobic, whereas
that near the bottom is anaerobic. Such ponds, having a mix of aerobic and anaerobic conditions, are called facultative ponds. In ponds, the oxygen required for
aerobic decomposition is derived from surface aeration and algal photosynthesis;
deeper ponds, called lagoons, are mechanically aerated. A schematic diagram of the
reactions taking place in a facultative pond is given in Figure 17.
Oxidation ponds can be designed to provide complete treatment of raw
sewage, but they require a good deal of space. These ponds have been used extensively in small communities where land constraints are not critical. The amount of
pond surface area required is considerable, with 1 hectare per 240 people (1 acre per
100 people) often being recommended, although in areas with warm climates and

mild winters, such as in the southwestern United States, about half that area is often
used (Viessman and Hammer, 1985).
Ponds are easy to build and manage, they accommodate large fluctuations in
flow, and they can provide treatment that approaches that of more sophisticated
biological systems but at a much lower cost. The effluent, however, may contain
undesirable concentrations of algae, and especially in the winter when less oxygen is
liberated by photosynthesis, they may produce unpleasant odors. Used alone, they
also have the disadvantage that the effluent may not meet the EPA secondary treatment requirement of 30 mg/L of both BOD5 and suspended solids. Their simplicity
and effectiveness in destroying pathogenic organisms, however, make these ponds
especially useful in developing countries.
Oxidation ponds are also used to augment secondary treatment, in which case
they are often called polishing ponds.

Attached Growth Treatment
Although not as common in modern wastewater treatment plants as suspended
growth processes, attached growth processes are still often used both as the sole secondary treatment process and as a pretreatment step before an activated sludge
process. Suspended growth processes are also attractive for application in rural and
underdeveloped areas where simple-to-construct, low-maintenance, and low-energy
secondary treatment is required.
Trickling Filters. Trickling filters were first used in 1893, and they have been
used successfully ever since, but they do cost more to build, are more temperature
sensitive, and remove less BOD than the activated sludge plants that were later
developed. A trickling filter consists of a rotating distribution arm that sprays the
feed wastewater over a circular bed of plastic packing or other coarse materials
(Figure 18). “Fist size” rocks were originally used as packing (and are still used for
simple, low cost operations), but plastic media is now preferred as it is easier to
work with, allows taller structures, and can be engineered to have much greater surface area for microbial growth per volume of filter. Tall trickling filters filled with
plastic media are often called biotowers. The spaces between the packing allow air

to circulate easily so that aerobic conditions can be maintained. Of course, the size
of the openings is such that there is no actual filtering taking place, so the name
trickling filter is somewhat of a misnomer. Instead, the media in the bed is covered
by a layer of biological slime that adsorbs and consumes the wastes trickling through
the bed. This slime consists mainly of bacteria, but it may also include fungi, algae,
protozoa, worms, insect larvae, and snails. The accumulating slime periodically
sloughs off the packing surface and is passed on with the water to the secondary settling tank, where it is removed. Not shown in Figure 18 is a provision for returning
some of the effluent from the filter back into the incoming flow. Such recycling not
only enables more effluent organic removal, but it also provides a way to keep the
biological slimes from drying out and then dying during low flow conditions.
Rotating Biological Contactors. Trickling filters (and biotowers) are examples of devices that rely on microorganisms that grow on the surface of rocks,
plastic, or other media. A variation on this attached growth idea is provided by the
rotating biological contactor (RBC). An RBC consists of a series of closely spaced,
circular, plastic disks, typically 3.6 m in diameter, that are attached to a rotating horizontal shaft. The bottom 40 percent of each disk is submersed in a tank containing
the wastewater to be treated. The biomass film that grows on the surface of the disks
moves into and out of the wastewater as the RBC rotates. While the microorganisms
are submerged in the wastewater, they adsorb organics; while they are rotated out of
the wastewater, they are supplied with needed oxygen. By placing modular RBC
units in series, greater treatment efficiencies than with trickling filters can be
achieved (Figure 19). These devices have been used in the United States only since
1969, and although early units suffered from assorted mechanical problems, they
are now generally accepted. They are easier to operate under varying load conditions
than trickling filters because it is easier to keep the solid medium wet at all times.

Hybrid Suspended/Attached Growth Systems
A large number and variety of secondary wastewater treatment systems, combining
attributes of both suspended and fixed growth biological reactors, have been developed and employed since the mid-1980s. The simplest employ a trickling filter
between the primary clarifier and the activated sludge aeration basin. This can
decrease the cost of and time required for removal of the most easily degraded
organic matter in the primary effluent. In these systems, the trickling filter effluent is

not clarified before it is sent to the activated sludge tank. More innovative and recent hybrid systems have employed either fixed or suspended media submerged in
the activated sludge aeration tank. Microbial biofilms, which grow on the media,
consume the organic matter in the surrounding aerated and agitated fluid. These
systems improve effluent clarification because it is simple to retain the attached cells
in the aeration basin, while providing very high mixed liquor microbial populations
(low F兾M ratios). The interested reader can find details of many of these systems,
including moving-bed biofilm reactors, fluidized bed biological reactors, submerged
fixed-film activated sludge reactors, and submerged rotating biological reactors in
Tchobanoglous et al. (2003).

Sludge Treatment
The processes described thus far have the purpose of removing solids and BOD from
the wastewater before the liquid effluent is released to the environment or reclaimed
for immediate human use such as landscape irrigation. What remains to be disposed
of is a mixture of solids and water, called sludge, which is withdrawn from the bottom
of the primary and secondary clarifiers. The collection, processing, and disposal of
sludge can be the most costly and complex aspect of wastewater treatment.
The quantity of sludge produced may be as high as 2 percent of the original
volume of wastewater, depending somewhat on the treatment process being used.
Because sludge can be as much as 97 percent water, and the cost of disposal will be
related to the volume of sludge being processed, one of the primary goals of sludge
treatment is to separate as much of the water from the solids as possible. The other
goal is to stabilize the solids so that they are no longer objectionable or environmentally damaging.
The traditional method of sludge processing utilizes anaerobic digestion. That
is, it depends on bacteria that thrive in the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic digestion
is slower than aerobic digestion but has the advantage that only a small percentage
of the wastes are converted into new bacterial cells. A typical yield coefficient (Y) for
aerobic degradation is 0.6 mg VSS/mg BOD5, whereas the yield for anaerobic degradation of the same substrate would be about 0.1 mg VSS/mg BOD5. Instead, most of
the organics are converted into carbon dioxide and methane gas. The digestion
process is complex, but can be summarized by the two steps shown in Figure 20. In
the first phase, complex organics, such as fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, are biologically converted into simpler organic materials, mostly organic fatty acids. The
bacteria that perform this conversion are commonly referred to as acid formers.
They are relatively tolerant to changes in temperature and pH, and they grow much
faster than the methane formers (methanogens) that carry out the second stage of
digestion.

Methane-forming bacteria slowly convert organic acids into CO2, CH4, and
other stable end products. These bacteria are very sensitive to temperature, pH,
toxins, and oxygen. If their environmental conditions are not just right, the rate at
which they convert organic acids to methane slows, and organic acids begin to
accumulate, dropping the pH. A positive feedback loop can be established where the
acid formers continue to produce acid while the methane formers, experiencing
lower and lower pH, become more and more inhibited. When this occurs, the digester is said to have gone sour, and massive doses of lime may be required to bring
it back to operational status.
Many treatment plants that incorporate anaerobic digestion for sludge stabilization use a two-stage digester such as in Figure 21. Sludge in the first stage is thoroughly mixed and heated to increase the rate of digestion. Typical detention times
are between 10 and 15 days. The second stage tank is neither heated nor mixed and
is likely to have a floating cover to accommodate the varying amount of gas being
stored. Stratification occurs in the second stage, which allows a certain amount of
separation of liquids (called supernatant) and solids, as well as the accumulation of
gas. The supernatant is returned to the main treatment plant for further BOD removal, and the settled sludge is removed, dewatered, and disposed of. The gas produced in the digester is about 60 percent methane, which is a valuable fuel with
many potential uses within the treatment plant. The methane may be used to heat
the first stage of the digester, and it can fuel an engine/generator set to power pumps,
compressors, and other electrical equipment.
Digested sludge removed from the second stage of the anaerobic digester is still
mostly liquid. The solids have been well digested, so there is little odor. Traditionally, dewatering was accomplished by pumping the sludge onto large sludge drying
beds where evaporation and seepage removed the water. However, vacuum filters,
filter presses, centrifuges, and incinerators are more commonly employed in modern
installations as they require less land and time than drying beds. The digested and
dewatered sludge is potentially useful as a soil conditioner, but most often it is
simply trucked away and disposed of in a landfill.

Water Quality Control

Nutrient Removal
It used to be that anything that followed conventional primary and biological treatment was considered to be advanced treatment. As such, extra stages designed to
remove nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, were considered part of
advanced treatment. Nutrient removal is now so common, however, that the term
“advanced” is used to describe additional steps taken to remove various toxic substances, such as metals and other hazardous wastes. Those treatment technologies
will be described later in this chapter.
Nitrogen Removal. As bacteria decompose waste, nitrogen that was bound up
in complex organic molecules is released as ammonia nitrogen. Subsequent oxidation of ammonia requires oxygen, which, if it occurs in the receiving body of water,
contributes to oxygen depletion problems. In addition, nitrogen is an important
nutrient for algal growth and, as Figure 16 indicates, only about 30 percent is normally removed in a conventional secondary treatment facility. To avoid these oxygendemand and eutrophication problems, treatment plants need to be augmented to
achieve higher rates of nitrogen removal.
Increased nitrogen control utilizes aerobic bacteria to convert ammonia
(NH4+ ) to nitrate (NO3- ), which is nitrification, followed by an anaerobic stage in
which different bacteria convert nitrate to nitrogen gas (N2), which is denitrification. The overall process then is referred to as nitrification/denitrification.
The nitrification step actually occurs in two bacterially driven stages. Ammonia
is converted to nitrite (NO2-) by Nitrosomonas, while Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to
nitrate. The combination of steps can be summarized by

Nitrification does not begin to be important until domestic wastewater is at
least 5 to 8 days old. Thus, if this method of nitrogen control is to be used, the
wastewater must be kept in the treatment plant for a much longer time than would
normally be the case. Detention times of 15 days or more are typically required. If
reaction (63) takes place in the treatment plant rather than in the receiving body of
water, at least the oxygen demand for nitrification is satisfied. The nitrogen, however, remains in the effluent, and if the process were to stop here, that nitrogen could
go on to contribute to unwanted algal growth. To avoid this, a denitrification step is
required.
The second phase of the nitrification/denitrification process is anaerobic

which releases harmless, elemental nitrogen gas. The energy to drive this reaction
comes from the organic matter indicated in (64). Because this denitrification process
occurs after waste treatment, there may not be enough organic material left in the
wastestream to supply the necessary energy. Thus, an additional source of
biodegradable organics, usually methanol (CH3OH), must be provided.
Phosphorus Removal. Only about 30 percent of the phosphorus in municipal
wastewater is removed during conventional primary and biological treatment

332

Water Quality Control

(Figure 16). Because phosphorus is very often the limiting nutrient, its removal from
the wastestream is especially important when eutrophication is a problem.
Phosphorus in wastewater exists in many forms, but all of it ends up as or3thophosphate (H2PO4-, HPO24 , and PO4 ). Removing phosphate is most often
accomplished by adding a coagulant, usually alum [Al2(SO4)3] or lime [Ca(OH)2].
The pertinent reaction involving alum is
Al2(SO4)3 + 2PO34 - : 2AlPO4p + 3SO24

(65)

Alum is sometimes added to the aeration tank when the activated sludge process is
being used, thus eliminating the need for an additional clarifier.

Hazardous Wastes
As infectious diseases such as cholera and typhoid have been brought under control
in the industrialized countries, there has been a shift in attention toward noninfectious human health problems such as cancer and birth defects that are induced by
toxic substances. Dramatic incidents in the late 1970s such as occurred at Love
Canal, New York, where hazardous substances from an abandoned dump site oozed
into backyards and basements, and Times Beach, Missouri, where tens of thousands
of gallons of dioxin-laced oil were carelessly sprayed onto the dusty streets, helped
motivate the following decades of hazardous waste controls.
In response to growing public pressure to do something about hazardous
wastes, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) in 1980 to deal with already contaminated sites,
and in 1980 and 1984, it strengthened the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) that controls new sources of hazardous waste. In essence, CERCLA deals
with problems of the past, while RCRA attempts to prevent future problems. These
two laws have provided the driving force behind almost all efforts at hazardous
waste control.
What is a hazardous waste? Unfortunately, the answer is largely a matter of
definition with various pieces of environmental legislation defining it somewhat differently. In general, the federal government defines hazardous waste as “anything
which, because of its quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical, or infectious
characteristics may cause, or significantly contribute to, an increase in mortality; or
cause an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible, illness; or pose
a substantial present or potential hazard to human health and the environment
when improperly treated, stored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise managed.” At times, a distinction needs to be made between a hazardous substance and
a hazardous waste. A hazardous substance, or material, has some commercial value,
whereas a hazardous waste is a material that has been used, spilled, or is no longer
needed.
More specifically, EPA uses two procedures to define wastes as hazardous.
One is based on a listing of substances and industrial process wastes that have been
designated as hazardous. This list is published in the Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR). The second defines a substance as hazardous if it possesses any of the

333

Water Quality Control

following four characteristic attributes: ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or
toxicity. These attributes are described briefly here:
• Ignitable substances are easily ignited and burn vigorously and persistently.
Examples include volatile liquids, such as solvents, whose vapors ignite at
relatively low temperatures (defined as 60°C or less).
• Corrosive substances include liquids with pH less than 2 or greater than 12.5
and those that are capable of corroding metal containers.
• Reactive substances are unstable under normal conditions. They can cause explosions and/or liberate toxic fumes, gases, and vapors when mixed with water.
• Toxic substances are harmful or fatal when ingested or absorbed. Toxicity
of a waste is determined using an extraction test that has been designed to simulate the expected leaching action that might occur, for example, in a sanitary
landfill. A substance is designated as being toxic if the extract from the test

contains any of a long list of chemicals in concentrations greater than allowed.
EPA changed the extraction test procedure in 1990 from one called the EP
Toxicity Test to the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test.
Note that the term hazardous substance is more all-encompassing than toxic
substance, although the two are often used interchangeably.
While these four characteristic attributes provide guidelines for considering a
substance to be hazardous, EPA maintains an extensive list of specific hazardous
wastes. EPA listed wastes are organized into three categories: source-specific wastes,
generic wastes, and commercial chemical products. Source-specific wastes include
sludges and wastewaters from treatment and production processes in specific industries such as petroleum refining and wood preserving. The list of generic wastes
includes wastes from common manufacturing and industrial processes such as solvents used in degreasing operations. The third list contains specific chemical products such as benzene, creosote, mercury, and various pesticides. All listed wastes are
presumed to be hazardous regardless of their concentrations. Well over 1,000 chemicals are listed by EPA as hazardous, some of which are shown in Table 9.

Hazardous Materials Legislation
Many federal environmental laws regulate hazardous materials in the United States.
Table 10 gives a very brief description of the most important of these, along with the
agency in charge of enforcement. In this section, we will focus on the three acts that
are most crucial to the current management programs for hazardous materials. The
first is the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which authorizes EPA to regulate
new chemicals as they are being developed as well as existing chemicals when there
are new concerns for their toxicity. The second is the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA), which provides guidelines for prudent management of new
and future hazardous substances. The third is the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which deals primarily with
mistakes of the past—inactive and abandoned hazardous waste sites.

Toxic Substances Control Act
The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) gives EPA the authority to gather information on the toxicity of particular chemicals, to assess whether those chemicals
cause unreasonable risks to humans and the environment, and to institute appropriate controls when deemed necessary. TSCA covers the full lifecycle of specific
chemicals, from premanufacturing, to manufacturing, importation, processing,
distribution, use, and disposal.
TSCA gives EPA the authority to compile an inventory of existing chemical
substances that are being manufactured or imported for commercial uses. The inventory contains information on well over 60,000 chemical substances. Entities that
are about to manufacture or import new chemicals that are not in the inventory
must give EPA a 90-day advance notification of their intent to do so. Included in the
notification must be the identity and molecular structure of the chemical; an estimate of the amounts to be manufactured and the proposed uses; the byproducts
resulting from manufacture, processing, use, and disposal of the chemical; and test

data relating to the health and environmental effects of the chemical. Similarly, significant new uses of chemicals that have already been approved for other purposes
must also be approved by EPA. Based on the data submitted, EPA may prohibit the
manufacture or importation until adequate data are developed to show that the
chemical will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. A manufacturer may also be required to recall a substance that is later found
to present an unreasonable risk.
TSCA also contains a provision that requires an exporter to notify EPA when
certain chemicals are going to be exported. EPA in turn notifies the importing
country’s government of the export and provides available information on the
chemicals, but, in general, it does not restrict such exports. However, chemicals that

336

Water Quality Control

are manufactured for export only can be covered by TSCA if EPA finds that international use poses an unreasonable risk within the United States.
Both TSCA and the RCRA (discussed next) regulate the disposal of hazardous
substances. The key distinction between the two is that TSCA deals with individual,
specific chemicals (e.g., PCBs), whereas RCRA generally deals with combinations of
chemicals contained in wastestreams.

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulates the generation,
storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous substances. It is our
single most important law dealing with the management of hazardous waste, and it
is perhaps the most comprehensive piece of legislation that EPA has ever promulgated. Its origins are in the 1965 Solid Waste Disposal Act, which was the first federal law to address the enormous problem of how to safely dispose of household,
municipal, commercial, and industrial refuse. Congress amended that law in 1970
with the passage of the Resource Recovery Act, and finally, RCRA was passed in
1976. Revisions to RCRA were made in 1980 and again in 1984. The 1984 amendments, referred to as the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA), significantly expanded the scope of RCRA, particularly in the area of land disposal.
The portions of RCRA that regulate hazardous wastes are contained in a section designated as Subtitle C. A major section of RCRA, Subtitle D, controls solid
waste disposal, “Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery.”
Transportation, Storage, and Disposal. The key concept in RCRA is that
hazardous substances must be properly managed from the moment they are generated until their ultimate disposal. This step-by-step management is often referred to as
the cradle-to-grave approach, and it has three key elements:
1. A tracking system, in which a manifest document accompanies any waste
that is transported from one location to another
2. A permitting system that helps assure safe operation of facilities that treat,
store, or dispose of hazardous wastes
3. A system of controls and restrictions governing the disposal of hazardous
wastes onto, or into, the land
About 96 percent of U.S. hazardous wastes are treated or disposed of at the site
where they were originally generated (U.S. EPA, 1987a). The remaining 4 percent still
represents a substantial volume of material that is transported from the source to
treatment, storage, or disposal (TSD) facilities. To help eliminate improper handling of
such transported wastes, EPA requires generators to prepare a hazardous waste manifest that must accompany the waste. The manifest identifies the type and quantity of
waste, the generator, the transporter, and the TSD facility to which the waste is being
shipped. One copy of the manifest is sent to EPA when the waste leaves the generator,
and another when the waste arrives at a TSD facility. The generator, who is ultimately
responsible for the waste tracking system, also receives a copy of the manifest after the
waste arrives at the TSD facility. Figure 22 illustrates the manifest system.
Under RCRA, the treatment, storage, and disposal facilities that accept hazardous waste must first obtain permits from EPA. The permitting process has been

established to give EPA power to enforce a number of standards and requirements,
including the power to inspect facilities and to bring civil actions against violators
of any of RCRA’s provisions. To help assure proper management of hazardous
wastes in the longer term, RCRA regulations require that TSD facilities acquire sufficient financial assurance mechanisms to ensure that the facility can be properly

maintained after it ultimately closes, including a provision for 30 years of facility
maintenance, security measures, and groundwater monitoring.
The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. The 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) to RCRA represented a turning point
in the relationship between Congress and EPA. Before HSWA, Congress allowed
considerable discretion to EPA with regard to the implementation of environmental
laws. During the early 1980s, however, it was perceived that EPA had become politicized and was not meeting congressional expectations, especially with regard to
implementation of CERCLA. When EPA decided to allow the disposal of liquid hazardous waste in land disposal facilities, Congress decided EPA had gone too far, and
it was time to return policy control back to Congress, which it did with HSWA.
HSWA has four main provisions. First, it imposed severe restrictions on land
disposal of hazardous waste. Second, it significantly reduced the level below which
the rate of generation of hazardous waste was exempt from RCRA provisions.
Third, it began the regulation of hundreds of thousands of leaking underground
storage tanks (LUST). And fourth, it closed a loophole that had allowed some hazardous waste sites to be exempt from either RCRA or CERCLA regulations.
In the past, about 80 percent of U.S. hazardous wastes were disposed of on
land either by pumping them underground using deep injection wells, burying them
in landfills, or containing them in surface impoundments. The 1984 HSWA to
RCRA significantly restricted disposal of wastes on land. In fact, land disposal is
banned unless EPA determines that for a particular site and type of waste, there will
be no migration of hazardous constituents for as long as the wastes remain hazardous. HSWA has been written in such a way that if EPA does not follow through
with such a determination within a specified period of time, then the land ban is
automatically imposed. This “hammer” provision was specifically intended to keep
EPA from dragging its feet on implementation and is a direct result of the conflict
between Congress and EPA during the Reagan administration.
To the extent that land disposal can continue to be used, new landfills and surface impoundments are required to have double liners, leachate collection systems,
and groundwater monitoring facilities to help assure long-term containment. Given
the ongoing problem of groundwater contamination from landfills, all liquid
hazardous wastes are banned. Further details on land disposal technologies are
described later in this chapter.
Waste Reduction. Clearly, rising economic costs of hazardous waste management are dictating a fresh look at the very origins of the problem itself. Is it really
necessary for us to generate more than one ton of hazardous waste per person per
year to provide the goods and services that we have come to expect? It is almost
always cheaper and simpler to control the amount of pollution generated in the first
place than to attempt to find engineering fixes that deal with it after it has been
created. The 1984 amendments to RCRA recognize this important role of waste
reduction by stating:
The Congress hereby declares it to be the national policy of the United
States that, wherever feasible, the generation of hazardous waste is to be
reduced or eliminated as expeditiously as possible.

FIGURE 23 Hierarchy of priorities in hazardous waste management.

Figure 23 suggests a priority system for ranking various approaches to hazardous waste reduction. The first priority is to find ways to eliminate uses of
hazardous substances altogether. Elimination might be achieved by changing manufacturing processes or by substituting products that can satisfy the same need without creating hazardous wastes (an example would be the substitution of concrete
posts for toxic, creosote-treated wooden posts). The next priority is to reduce the
amounts generated. Again, manufacturing process changes can be important. The
third strategy is to recycle hazardous substances, such as solvents and acids, to maximize their use before treatment and disposal becomes necessary. Finally, hazardous
substances can be treated to reduce their volume and toxicity. Only after all of those
options have been exhausted should disposal be considered.
Eliminating, reducing, and recycling hazardous substances reduces treatment
and disposal costs, and often generators can find it in their own economic best interest to actively seek out these source-reduction opportunities as a way to reduce the
overall cost of doing business. RCRA, in fact, requires generators to certify on their
hazardous waste manifests that they have taken steps to reduce the volume and toxicity of the hazardous waste that they are creating.

The Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liabilities Act
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liabilities Act
(CERCLA) was enacted in 1980 to deal with abandoned hazardous waste sites. It is
more often referred to as the Superfund law as a result of one of its key provisions in
which a $1.6 billion trust fund was created from special crude oil and chemical company taxes. In 1986, CERCLA was reauthorized, and the trust fund was increased
to $8.5 billion with half of the money coming from petroleum and chemical companies, and most of the rest coming from a special corporate environmental tax
augmented by general revenues. The revisions to CERCLA enacted in 1986 are designated as the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA).
CERCLA is an unusual environmental law in that it does not involve the usual
regulations and permitting requirements. Instead, it is focused on identifying hazardous waste sites, preparing cleanup plans, and then forcing those deemed to be
responsible parties (RPs) to pay for the remediation. Under CERCLA, EPA can deal
with both short-term, emergency situations triggered by the actual or potential

release of hazardous substances into the environment, as well as with long-term
problems involving abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites for which
more permanent solutions are required.
Short-term removal actions can be taken at any site where there is an imminent threat to human health or the environment, such as might occur during a spill
or fire, or when wastes that have been illegally disposed of are discovered (“midnight dumping”). In addition to removing and disposing of hazardous substances
and securing the endangered area, EPA may take more extensive actions as necessary, such as providing alternate drinking water supplies to local residents if their
drinking water has been contaminated, or even temporarily relocating residents.
More complex and extensive problems that are not immediately lifethreatening are handled under EPA’s remedial programs, which are outlined in
Figure 24. Central to the Superfund process is the creation of a National Priorities
List (NPL) of sites that are eligible for federally financed remedial activities. The
NPL identifies the worst sites in the nation based on such factors as the quantities
and toxicity of wastes involved, the exposure pathways, the number of people
potentially exposed, and the importance and vulnerability of the underlying groundwater.
After a site is listed, EPA begins a remedial investigation/feasibility study
(RI/FS) to determine appropriate remedial actions for the site. The remedial investigation phase involves gathering information needed to characterize the contamination problem at the site, including environmental and public health risks. The

341

Water Quality Control

feasibility study that follows uses the remedial investigation information to identify,
evaluate, and select cleanup alternatives. These alternative cleanup approaches are
analyzed based on their relative effectiveness and cost. The RI/FS process culminates
with the signing of a record of decision (ROD), in which the remedial action that
has been selected is set forth. After the ROD has been signed, the detailed remedial
design of the selected alternative takes place. For complex sites, the entire process
from listing to the beginning of the actual cleanup itself has often taken five years
or more.
The final remedial action may consist of a number of short-term steps, such
as installation of surface water run-off controls, excavating soil, building belowgrade containment walls, and capping the site. Most remedial actions have involved
pump-and-treat technologies, which have serious limitations and often require
decades of pumping. However, from 1986 to 1999, the percentage of groundwater
Superfund RODs which selected only pump-and-treat remediation, dropped from
92 percent to 30 percent as other remedial strategies became more advanced and
accepted (U.S. EPA, 2002a). The cleanup of a typical NPL site is a slow, complex,
expensive process, which has led some to question whether it is really worth all that
effort.
One of the most important, guiding policies of CERCLA is that those parties
who are responsible for hazardous waste problems will be forced to pay the entire
cost of cleanup. Responsible parties (RPs) may be the historic owners or operators
of the site, any generators who disposed of wastes at the site (whether legally or
not), or even the transporters who brought wastes to the site. The courts have recognized the concept of retroactive, strict, and joint-and-several liability for costs of
cleanup. Retroactive covers problems created before Superfund was enacted; strict
liability refers to the fact that liability does not depend on whether the RPs were
negligent or diligent in their disposal practices; and joint-and-several means, in
essence, that if damages cannot be individually apportioned by the RPs themselves,
then each and every party is subject to liability for the entire cleanup cost. In other
words, no matter when their contribution occurred, no matter how careful they
were, and no matter how little an individual RP may have contributed to the overall
problem, they can, theoretically, be liable for the entire cost of the cleanup. If RPs do
not voluntarily perform the appropriate response actions, EPA can use Superfund
monies to clean up the site. If they do so, then EPA is empowered to collect three
times the cleanup cost from the RPs.
The retroactive, strict, joint-and-several provisions of Superfund have been
heavily criticized. Banks and lending institutions worry that they could be liable for
cleanup costs just because they loaned money to firms that were named as RPs.
Insurance companies are fighting lawsuits when RPs claim they were covered for
cleanup costs under their general liability insurance. Municipalities that have been
named as RPs when their landfills have leaked don’t feel they should be liable for
enormous cleanup costs. To many, it seems unfair to be held responsible for disposal
practices that were perfectly legal in the past, especially when their contributions to
the problem were minimal. And finally, it seems particularly unfair to some that
owners of property are at risk for cleanup costs even though they were not responsible in any way for the contamination.
CERCLA has also been criticized because it requires that the cleanup solution
selected provides a permanent solution to the contamination problem. For some

342

Water Quality Control

sites, it might be argued that temporary measures can cost very little while virtually
eliminating health risks. For example, consider a site located some distance from
residences with contaminated soil but not contaminated groundwater. It can be
argued that capping the site, surrounding it with fences and signs, and monitoring
the soil and groundwater would be a much better use of resources than a permanent
site remediation project. However, it might not be allowed under CERCLA.
Brownfields. In an effort to address some of the liability concerns and fairness
issues of CERCLA, as well as to help revitalize communities affected by contamination, EPA launched its Brownfields Economic Redevelopment Initiative in 1995.
Brownfields are defined to be “abandoned, idled, or under-used industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.” The Initiative is based on the belief that
public fear of contamination and lender concerns for liability are causing companies
to leave brownfields in the urban core and head for greenfields outside the cities. It
is hoped that implementation of EPA’s Brownfields Action Agenda will help reverse
the spiral of unaddressed contamination, declining property values, and increased
unemployment often found in inner-city industrial areas (U.S. EPA, 1996).
Key components of the Brownfields initiative include removing eligible sites
from the Superfund site tracking system, known as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System (CERCLIS).
Initial actions removed 27,000 such sites out of the 40,000 that were being tracked.
Removing sites from CERCLIS is intended to convey assurance that EPA will no
longer pursue Superfund action at these sites. A second, very important component
of the Initiative is a clarification of liability issues that frequently cause potential
buyers and lenders to avoid contaminated properties. For example, EPA will not
take action against owners when hazardous substances enter the property from
aquifers contaminated elsewhere, as long as the landowner did not in any way cause
the problem, and as long as the property owner did not have a contractual arrangement with the polluter.
The Brownfields issue is helping to focus attention on risk-based corrective
actions in which the most feasible remediation technologies are coupled with best
management practices to provide cost-effective cleanup without compromising the
protection of public health, water quality, and the environment.

Hazardous Waste Treatment Technologies
Even with a much more vigorous hazardous waste reduction program, as RCRA
requires, there will still be large quantities of hazardous wastes that will require
treatment and disposal. In the past, there was little treatment, and disposal was
most often on land. In both SARA (Superfund) and the 1984 Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments of RCRA, emphasis is on the development and use of alternative and innovative treatment technologies that result in permanent destruction of
wastes or a reduction in toxicity, mobility, and volume. Land disposal is greatly
restricted under the 1984 RCRA amendments.

343

Water Quality Control

Treatment technologies are often categorized as being chemical, biological,
physical, thermal, or fixation/stabilization. These categories are reasonably well
defined, although there is room for confusion when technologies have overlapping
characteristics:
• Chemical, biological, and physical wastewater treatment processes are currently the most commonly used methods of treating aqueous hazardous waste.
Chemical treatment transforms waste into less hazardous substances using
such techniques as pH neutralization, oxidation or reduction, and precipitation. Biological treatment uses microorganisms to degrade organic compounds
in the wastestream. Physical treatment processes include gravity separation,
phase change systems such as air and steam stripping of volatiles from liquid
wastes, and various filtering operations, including carbon adsorption.
• Thermal destruction processes include incineration, which is increasingly
becoming a preferred option for the treatment of hazardous wastes, and pyrolysis, which is the chemical decomposition of waste brought about by heating
the material in the absence of oxygen.
• Fixation/stabilization techniques involve removal of excess water from a waste
and solidifying the remainder either by mixing it with a stabilizing agent, such
as Portland cement or polymeric substances, or vitrifying it to create a glassy
substance. Solidification is most often used on inorganic sludges.
Choosing an appropriate technology to use in any given situation is obviously
beyond the scope of this text. Not only are there many different kinds of hazardous
wastes, in terms of their chemical makeup, but the treatability of the wastes depends
on their form. A technology suitable for treating PCBs in sludges, for example, may
not be appropriate for treating the same contaminant in dry soil. Table 11 gives a
partial listing of available treatment technologies appropriate for a variety of types
of hazardous wastestreams along with the applicable form of waste (liquid, gaseous,
solids/sludges). For a more complete list, as well as detailed descriptions of each
technology, see Standard Handbook of Hazardous Waste Treatment and Disposal
(Freeman, 1989).

Physical Treatment
The use of the physical treatment processes described following is not limited to
hazardous waste treatment. For instance, sedimentation was also discussed earlier in
this chapter as a treatment method commonly used in both water and wastewater
treatment plants. In fact, all of the physical processes except monitored natural
attenuation are used to some degree in drinking water or wastewater plants.
Sedimentation. The simplest physical treatment systems that separate solids
from liquids take advantage of gravity settling and natural flotation. Special sedimentation tanks and clarification tanks are designed to encourage solids to settle so
they can be collected as a sludge from the bottom of the tank. Some solids will float
naturally to the surface and they can be removed with a skimming device. It is also
possible to encourage flotation by introducing finely divided bubbles into the
wastestream. The bubbles collect particles as they rise, and the combination can be
skimmed from the surface. Separated sludges can then be further concentrated by

evaporation, filtration, or centrifugation. An example of a vacuum filter is shown in
Figure 25.
Adsorption. Physical treatment can also be used to remove small concentrations
of hazardous substances dissolved in water that would never settle out. One of the
most commonly used techniques for removing organics involves the process of
adsorption, which is the physical adhesion of chemicals onto the surface of a solid.
The effectiveness of the adsorbent is directly related to the amount of surface area
available to attract the molecules or particles of contaminant. The most commonly
used adsorbent is a very porous matrix of granular activated carbon (GAC), which
has an enormous surface area (on the order of 1,000 m2/g). A single handful of GAC
has an internal surface area of about 1 acre.

Granular-activated carbon treatment systems usually consist of a series of
large vessels partially filled with adsorbent. Contaminated water enters the top of
each vessel, passes down through the GAC, and is released at the bottom. After a period of time, the carbon filter becomes saturated with adsorbed contaminants and
must be either replaced or regenerated. Regeneration can be an expensive, energyintensive process, usually done off site. During regeneration, the contaminants are
usually burned from the surface of the carbon granules, although in some cases a
solvent is used to remove them. GAC that cannot be regenerated due to its contaminant composition must be properly managed for disposal.
Aeration. For chemicals that are relatively volatile, another physical process,
aeration, can be used to drive the contaminants out of solution. These stripping systems typically use air, although in some circumstances steam is used. In the most
commonly used air stripper, contaminated water trickles downward over the surface
of packing material in a tower, while air is blown upward carrying away the
volatiles with it. Such a packed tower can easily remove over 95 percent of the
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including such frequently encountered ones as
trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethane, benzene, toluene, and other
common organics derived from solvents. Another type of stripper, called an
induced-draft stripper, does not use a blower or packing material. In the induceddraft tower, a carefully engineered series of nozzles sprays contaminated water horizontally through the sides of a chamber. Air passing through the chamber draws off
the volatiles. Induced-draft strippers are cheaper to build and operate, but their performance is much lower than a packed tower.
By combining air stripping with GAC, many volatile and nonvolatile organic
compounds can be removed from water to nondetectable levels. By passing contaminated water first through the air stripper, most of the volatile organics are removed

before reaching the GAC system, which extends the life of the carbon before regeneration or replacement is required.
The volatiles removed in an air stripper are, in some circumstances, released
directly to the atmosphere. When discharge into the atmosphere is unacceptable, a
GAC treatment system can be added to the exhaust air, as shown in Figure 26.
Other Physical Processes. Other physical processes that are sometimes used to
treat hazardous wastes include reverse osmosis, ion exchange, and electrodialysis.
Reverse osmosis devices use pressure to force contaminated water against a semipermeable membrane. The membrane acts as a filter, allowing the water to be pushed
through its pores but restricting the passage of larger molecules that are to be removed. Ion exchange is a process wherein ions to be removed from the wastestream
are exchanged with ions associated with a special exchange resin. Membrane filtration and ion exchange have been discussed earlier in the context of drinking water
and wastewater treatment. In the context of hazardous wastes, ion exchange is often
used to remove toxic metal ions from solution. Electrodialysis uses ion-selective
membranes and an electric field to separate anions and cations in solution. In the
past, electrodialysis was most often used for purifying brackish water, but it is now
finding a role in hazardous waste treatment. Metal salts from plating rinses are
sometimes removed in this way.
Although it is not strictly a physical remediation process, monitored natural
attenuation (MNA) has been increasingly implemented at Superfund sites. MNA
depends on the natural physical, chemical, and biological processes in the subsurface

347

Water Quality Control

to degrade and immobilize the contaminants. It is implemented together with a carefully controlled monitoring program to ensure that natural processes are successfully remediating the site and stopping further environmental damage or human
exposure from occurring. Natural bioremediation by indigenous microbes in the
subsurface is often a key component of successful MNA. Between 1982 and 1999,
Superfund site RODs with specified remedies listed MNA as the only groundwater
remedy selected at 12 percent of the sites and MNA along with pump-and-treat or in
situ bioremediation at an additional 9 percent of the sites (U.S. EPA, 2002a). MNA
can be a cost-effective and environmentally responsible alternative to active cleanup
when it is applied with the same regard to initial site characterization and long-term
oversight as more active approaches.

Chemical Treatment
Chemically treating hazardous waste has the potential advantage of not only converting it to less hazardous forms, but it can also produce useful byproducts in some
circumstances. By encouraging resource recovery, the treatment cost can sometimes
be partially offset by the value of the end products produced.
Neutralization. Many chemical processes can be used to treat hazardous wastes,
and the process decision depends primarily upon the characteristic of the waste. For
example, recall that one of RCRA’s categories of hazardous waste is anything corrosive, that is, having a pH of less than 2 or more than 12.5. Such wastes can be chemically neutralized. Acidic wastewaters are usually neutralized with slaked lime
[Ca(OH)2] in a continuously stirred tank reactor. The rate of addition of lime is controlled with a feedback control system that monitors pH and adjusts the feed rate
accordingly.
Alkaline wastewaters may be neutralized by adding acid directly or by bubbling in gaseous CO2, forming carbonic acid (H2CO3). The advantage of CO2 is
that it is often readily available in the exhaust gas from any combustion process at
the treatment site. Simultaneous neutralization of acid and caustic waste can be
accomplished in the same vessel as is suggested by Figure 27.

348

Water Quality Control

Chemical Precipitation. The ability to adjust pH is important not only for
waste neutralization, but also because it facilitates other chemical processes that
actually remove undesirable substances from the wastestream. For example, a common method for removing heavy metals from a liquid waste is via chemical precipitation, which is pH dependent. By properly adjusting pH, the solubility of toxic
metals can be decreased, leading to formation of a precipitate that can be removed
by settling and filtration.
Frequently, precipitation involves the use of lime, Ca(OH)2, or caustic, NaOH,
to form metal hydroxides. For example, the following reaction suggests the use of
lime to form the hydroxide of a divalent metal (M2 + ):
M2 + + Ca(OH)2 : M(OH)2 + Ca2 +

(66)

Metal hydroxides are relatively insoluble in basic solutions, and, as shown in
Figure 28, they are amphoteric, that is, they have some pH at which their solubility
is a minimum. Because each metal has its own optimum pH, it is tricky to control
precipitation of a mix of different metals in the same waste. For a waste containing
several metals, it may be necessary to use more than one stage of precipitation to
allow different values of pH to control the removal of different metals.
Although hydroxide precipitation using lime is the most common metal
removal process, even lower concentrations of metals in the effluent can be obtained
by precipitating the metals as sulfides. As can be seen in Figure 28, metal sulfides are
considerably less soluble than metal hydroxides. A disadvantage of sulfide precipitation is the potential formation of odorous and toxic hydrogen sulfide gas.
Chemical Reduction-Oxidation. Reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions provide another important chemical treatment alternative for hazardous wastes. When
electrons are removed from an ion, atom, or molecule, the substance is oxidized;
when electrons are added, it is reduced. Both oxidation and reduction occur in the
same reaction, hence the abbreviation redox. One of the most important redox
treatment processes is the reduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr VI) to trivalent
chromium (Cr III) in large electroplating operations. Sulfur dioxide is often used as
the reducing agent, as shown in the following reactions:
SO2 + H2O : H2SO3

(67)

2 CrO3 + 3 H2SO3 : Cr2 (SO4)3 + 3 H2O

(68)

The trivalent chromium formed in reaction (68) is much less toxic and more easily
precipitated than the original hexavalent chromium. Notice the chromium in reaction (68) is reduced from an oxidation state of +6 to +3, and the sulfur is oxidized
from +4 to +6.
Another important redox treatment involves the oxidation of cyanide wastes,
which are also common in the metal finishing industry. In the following reactions,
cyanide is first converted to a less toxic cyanate using alkaline chlorination (pH
above 10); further chlorination oxidizes the cyanate to simple carbon dioxide and
nitrogen gas. Nearly complete destruction of cyanide results.
NaCN + Cl2 + 2 NaOH : NaCNO + 2 NaCl + H2O

Wastes that can be treated via redox oxidation include benzene, phenols, most
organics, cyanide, arsenic, iron, and manganese. Those that can be successfully
treated using reduction treatment include chromium (VI), mercury, lead, silver, chlorinated organics like PCBs, and unsaturated hydrocarbons (U.S. EPA, 1988a).
Ultraviolet Radiation/Oxidation. A promising approach to destruction of
dissolved organic compounds is oxidation, which converts organics into simple
carbon dioxide and water. A number of oxidants are possible, including hydrogen

350

Water Quality Control

peroxide, oxygen, ozone, and potassium permanganate. One of the most potent
oxidizers is the hydroxyl free radical (•OH), which easily initiates the oxidation of
hydrogen-containing organic molecules. The formation of hydroxyl radicals can be
enhanced by exposing an oxidant, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or ozone (O3),
to ultraviolet (UV) light, as the following reactions suggest:
O3 + hn + H2O : H2O2 + O2

(71)

•

H2O2 + hn : 2 OH

(72)

where hn represents a photon of light with frequency n. Low-pressure mercury
vapor lamps produce photons of about the right wavelength (254 nm) needed to
efficiently convert the hydrogen peroxide in (72). The initial oxidization of an
organic molecule using the hydroxyl radical can be represented as
•

OH + HR : H2O + R• : . . . : CO2

(73)

where R• represents a carbon-based radical. The rate of destruction of various chlorinated organics using oxidation by ozone alone is compared with destruction using
ozone and UV light together in Figure 29.

Water Quality Control

Biological Treatment
Virtually all municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United States and a large
number of industrial systems rely on biological treatment processes to decompose
organic wastes. Biological treatment systems use microorganisms, mainly bacteria,
to metabolize organic material, converting it to carbon dioxide, water, and new bacterial cells. Because biological systems rely on living organisms to transform wastes,
considerable care must be exercised to assure conditions are conducive to life.
Microbes need a source of carbon and energy, which they can get from the organics
they consume, as well as nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. They are sensitive to pH and temperature. Some need oxygen.
As living organisms, microbes are susceptible to toxic substances, which at first
glance makes biological treatment of hazardous wastes seem an unlikely choice.
Surprisingly, though, most hazardous organics are amenable to biological treatment
(bioremediation) provided that the proper distribution of organisms can be established
and maintained. For any given organic substance, some organisms may find that substance to be an acceptable food supply, whereas others may find it toxic. Moreover,
organisms that flourish with the substance at one concentration may die when the concentration is increased beyond some critical level. Finally, even though a microbial
population may have been established that can handle a particular kind of organic
waste, it may be destroyed if the characteristics of the waste are changed too rapidly. If
changes are made slowly enough, however, selection pressures may allow the microbial consortium to adjust to the new conditions and thereby remain effective.
Aqueous Waste Treatment. It is convenient to consider biological treatment
of various sorts of wastewaters, including leachates from hazardous waste landfills,
separately from in situ biological treatment of soils and groundwater. When liquid
hazardous wastes can be conveyed to the treatment facility, it is possible to carefully
control the characteristics of the waste that reach the biological portion of the
facility, increasing the likelihood of a successful degradation process.
Biological treatment is often just one step in an overall treatment system. As
suggested in Figure 30, an example system would include a chemical treatment stage

to oxidize and precipitate some of the toxics, followed by physical treatment to separate the resulting solids from the wastestream. The effluent from the physical treatment step may then be conditioned to give it the right pH and nutrient supply
needed by the microorganisms in the biological treatment step.
The biological treatment stage utilizes processes already described for municipal wastewater treatment plants. After biological treatment, further sedimentation
and clarification followed by carbon adsorption can be used to polish the effluent.
Inorganic sludges produced during chemical processing and organic sludges from
the biotreatment stage are separated from the liquid wastestream and treated. These
sludges must be dewatered and disposed of in accordance with RCRA regulations
because they are likely to be hazardous.

Waste Incineration
Waste incineration is being advocated by EPA as its technology of choice for many
types of hazardous wastes. Incineration is particularly effective with organic wastes,
not only in soils but in other solids, gases, liquids, and slurries (thin mixtures of
liquids and solids) and sludges (thick mixtures) as well. Carcinogens, mutagens, and
teratogens as well as pathological wastes can all be completely detoxified in a
properly operated incinerator. Incinerators are not, however, capable of destroying
inorganic compounds, although they can concentrate them in ash, making transportation and disposal more efficient. In addition, metals that volatilize at temperatures below 2,000°F pose a particular problem because, once vaporized, they are
difficult to remove using conventional air pollution control equipment.
The principal measure of an incinerator’s performance is known as the
destruction and removal efficiency (DRE). A DRE of 99.99 percent, for example,
(commonly called “four nines DRE”) means that 1 molecule of an organic compound is released to the air for every 10,000 molecules entering the incinerator.
RCRA requires a minimum DRE of 99.99 percent for most organic compounds, and
a DRE of 99.9999 percent (six nines) for dioxins and dibenzofurans. The Toxic
Substances Control Act regulations cover thermal destruction of PCBs, and although
they are written somewhat differently from RCRA, they in essence require a
99.9999 percent DRE.
As is the case for all combustion processes, the most critical factors that determine combustion completeness are (1) the temperature in the combustion chamber,
(2) the length of time that combustion takes place, (3) the amount of turbulence or
degree of mixing, and (4) the amount of oxygen available for combustion.
Controlling these factors, which is crucial to obtaining the high levels of performance required by law, is made especially difficult in hazardous waste incinerators
because of the variability of the wastes being burned. In addition to combustion
controls, stack gas cleaning systems are a necessary part of the system. Proper operation and maintenance of these complex incineration systems requires highly trained
personnel, diligent and qualified supervisory staff, and an alert governmental agency
to assure compliance with all regulations.
Although there are a number of types of hazardous waste incinerators, only
two principal designs account for most of the existing units in operation: the liquid

injection incinerator and the rotary kiln incinerator. Liquid injection incinerators
are the most common even though they are usable only for gases, liquids, and slurries thin enough to be pumped through an atomizing nozzle. The nozzle emits tiny
droplets of waste that are mixed with air and an auxiliary fuel such as natural gas or
fuel oil. The resulting gaseous mixture is burned at a very high temperature. The
atomizing nozzle used in a liquid injection incinerator must be designed to accommodate the particular characteristics of the expected wastestream, which limits the
types of waste that any given incinerator can treat.
The rotary kiln incinerator is more versatile than the liquid injection type,
being capable of handling gases, liquids, sludges, and solids of all sorts, including
drummed wastes. Figure 31 shows a diagram of such an incinerator. The main unit
consists of a slightly inclined, rotating cylinder perhaps 2 to 5 meters in diameter
and 3 to 10 meters long. Wastes and auxiliary fuel are introduced into the high end
of the kiln, and combustion takes place while the cylinder slowly rotates. The rotation helps increase turbulence, which improves combustion efficiency. Partially combusted waste gases are passed to a secondary combustion chamber for further
oxidation. Rotary kiln incinerators are commercially available as mobile units and
fixed installations.
In spite of numerous controls, hazardous waste incinerators have the potential
to emit amounts of noxious gases that may be unacceptable to neighbors. Emissions
may include unburned organic compounds from the original waste, various
products of incomplete combustion (PICs) formed in the incinerator, odors, carbon
monoxide, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, hydrogen chloride, and particulates. The unburned ash and sludge from the air pollution control devices are considered hazardous wastes and must be treated as such. If they are transported off site, then not
only are there hazardous materials transported into the facility, but there are some

354

leaving as well. The perception of potentially adverse impacts associated with incineration has made the siting of these facilities an extremely difficult task.

Land Disposal
The EPA regulates the land disposal of hazardous wastes under its Land Disposal
Restrictions (LDR) program. About 23 million tons of hazardous waste is land disposed in the United States each year (U.S. EPA, 2001). Land disposal techniques
include landfills, surface impoundments, underground injection wells, and waste
piles. Historically, land disposal has been the most common method of getting rid of
hazardous wastes in this country. Unfortunately, many of these disposal sites have
been poorly engineered and monitored and the results have sometimes been tragic,
as well as very expensive to rectify. They have been used extensively in the past
because they were the most convenient and inexpensive method of disposal. However, remediation at older sites that have leaked toxics into the soil and groundwater
has proven to be tremendously costly, and the originally perceived economic advantage of land disposal is now seen to often have been short-sighted.
As was mentioned earlier, the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments
(HSWA) to RCRA ban unsafe, untreated wastes from land disposal (U.S. EPA,
1991). The HSWA provisions are LDRs, where land disposal includes placement of
hazardous waste in the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Landfills
Surface impoundments
Waste piles
Injection wells
Land treatment facilities
Salt domes or salt bed formations
Underground mines or caves
Concrete vaults or bunkers, intended for disposal purposes

HWSA requires that EPA assess all hazardous wastes to determine whether land
disposal can be used, and if so, under what conditions. Without an EPA determination
on a particular waste, that waste is automatically banned from land disposal. RCRA
goes on to provide new restrictions and standards for those land disposal facilities that
will be allowed to accept hazardous substances, including the following:
• Banning liquids from landfills
• Banning underground injection of hazardous waste within a quarter-mile of a
drinking water well
• Requiring more stringent structural and design conditions for landfills and
surface impoundments, including two or more liners, leachate collection systems above and between the liners, and groundwater monitoring
• Requiring cleanup or corrective action if hazardous waste leaks from a facility
• Requiring information from disposal facilities on pathways of potential
human exposure to hazardous substances

355

Water Quality Control

• Requiring location standards that are protective of human health and the
environment, for example, allowing disposal facilities to be constructed only
in suitable hydrogeologic settings
Landfills. In accordance with these new, more stringent RCRA requirements, the
design and operation of hazardous waste landfills has become much more sophisticated. A hazardous waste landfill is now designed as a modular series of threedimensional (3D) control cells. By incorporating separate cells, it becomes possible
to segregate wastes so that only compatible wastes are disposed of together. Arriving
wastes are placed in an appropriate cell and covered at the end of each working day
with a layer of cover soil.
Beneath the hazardous wastes, there must be a double-liner system to stop the
flow of liquids, called leachate, from entering the soil and groundwater beneath the
site. The upper liner must be a flexible-membrane lining (FML) usually made of
sheets of plastic or rubber. Commonly used plastics include polyvinyl chloride
(PVC), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and chlorinated polyethylene (CPE).
Rubber FMLs include chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSPE) and ethylene propylene
diene monomer (EPDM). Depending on the material chosen for the FML, the thickness is typically anywhere from 0.25 mm (10 mils) to over 2.5 mm (100 mils). The
lower liner is usually an FML, but recompacted clay at least 3 feet thick is also considered acceptable.
Leachate that accumulates above each liner is collected in a series of perforated drainage pipes and pumped to the surface for treatment. To help reduce the
amount of leachate formed by precipitation seeping into the landfill, a low permeability cap is placed over completed cells. When the landfill is finally closed, a cap
that may consist of an FML along with a layer of compacted clay is placed over the
entire top with enough slope to assure drainage away from the wastes.
The landfill must also include monitoring facilities. The groundwater flowing
beneath the site should be tested with monitoring wells placed up-gradient and
down-gradient from the site. There may only need to be one up-gradient well to test
the “natural” quality of the groundwater before it flows under the site, but there
should be at least three or more monitoring wells placed down-gradient to assure
detection of any leakage from the site. In addition, the soil under the site, above the
water table, should be tested using devices called suction lysimeters.
A cross-section of a completed hazardous waste landfill is shown in Figure 32.
Surface Impoundments. Surface impoundments are excavated or diked areas
used to store liquid hazardous wastes. Usually storage is temporary unless the impoundment has been designed to eventually be closed as a landfill. Impoundments
have been popular because they have been cheap and because wastes remain accessible, allowing some treatment to take place during storage. Typical treatment technologies used in surface impoundments include neutralization, precipitation,
settling, and biodegradation.
Historically, surface impoundments have often been poorly constructed and
monitored. In a survey of 180,000 surface impoundments, EPA estimated that prior
to 1980, only about one-fourth were lined, and fewer than 10 percent had monitoring programs (U.S. EPA, 1984). The same survey also found that surface impoundments were usually poorly sited. More than half were located over very thin or very

permeable soils that would allow easy transport of leachate to groundwater. Over
three-fourths of the impoundments were located over very thick and permeable
aquifers that would allow relatively rapid dispersion of contaminants should they
reach the water table. Moreover, about 98 percent of the surface impoundments
were located less than one mile from sources of high-quality drinking water.
As a result of these poor siting, construction, and management practices,
surface impoundments are the principal source of contamination in a large number
of Superfund sites. Current EPA regulations require new surface impoundments,
or expansions to existing impoundments, to have two or more liners, a leachatecollection system, and monitoring programs similar to those required for landfills.
However, the legacy of past practices will undoubtedly take billions of dollars and
decades of time to remediate.
Underground Injection. The most popular way to dispose of liquid hazardous
wastes has been to force them underground through deep injection wells
(Figure 33). About 89 percent of the land disposed hazardous waste and more than
700 million gallons of fluids annually are disposed in underground injection wells
(U.S. EPA, 2002b). To help assure that underground drinking water supplies won’t
become contaminated, since 1984, injection wells used to dispose of hazardous industrial wastes are required to extend below the lowest formation containing underground sources of drinking water. Typical injection depths are more than 700 meters
below the surface. Because the main concern with underground injection is the potential for contaminating underground drinking water supplies, the regulation of
such systems has come under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974.
Unfortunately, a number of hazardous waste injection wells have had leakage
problems, so such wells cannot be considered entirely safe. Regulations covering
construction, operation, and monitoring of injection wells are becoming more stringent, and as is the case for all land disposal options, continued reliance on this technology is being discouraged.

Horizontal shaft paddle wheels are used in a tapered flocculation basin comprised of three
compartments. The power input to the paddles progressively decreases through the basin
with the first compartment paddle driving with 186 W of power, the second compartment
paddle with 30.0 W of power, and the final compartment paddle with 7.50 W of power.

A rapid sand filter has a loading rate of 8.00 m/h, surface dimensions of 10 m * 8 m, an
effective filtration rate of 7.70 m/h, and a production efficiency of 96 percent. A complete

plant are 8.0 * 8.0 m surface area and operate on the following schedule. A filter is
cleaned once in each 24-hour period, and the backwash rate is 10.0 L # m-2 # s-1 for a period of 8 min. It takes an additional 8 min to drain the filter and break up the media with
air injection. Of the total filter cycle time of 24 hours, 15 minutes is used for rinsing the
filter after backwashing. During production, water is applied to the filter at a rate of
5.50 L # m-2 # s-1.

The PureNSafe Company is designing a solar-driven, portable water disinfection system
to be used by the military. The system is simply an inlet tube, a pump, a well-mixed chamber, and an outlet tube. Water is pumped continuously into the chamber where it is irradiated with UV light before exiting through the outlet tube into a collection vessel. The
disinfection rate constant for UV light is 7.80 s-1, and the bacterial count in the water
must be reduced by 99.9 percent. Because the army needs the unit to fit into a backpack,

Introduction
Air pollution is certainly not a new phenomenon. Early references date to the Middle
Ages, when smoke from burning coal was already considered such a serious problem
that in 1307, King Edward I banned its use in lime kilns in London. In more recent
times, though still decades ago, several serious episodes focused attention on the
need to control the quality of the air we breathe. The worst of these occurred in
London, in 1952. A week of intense fog and smoke resulted in over 4,000 excess

deaths that were directly attributed to the pollution. In the United States, the most
alarming episode occurred during a 4-day period in 1948 in Donora, Pennsylvania,
when 20 deaths and almost 6,000 illnesses were linked to air pollution. At the time,
Donora had a population of only 14,000, making this the highest per capita death
rate ever recorded for an air pollution episode.
Those air pollution episodes were the results of exceptionally high concentrations of sulfur oxides and particulate matter, the primary constituents of industrial
smog or sulfurous smog. Sulfurous smog is caused almost entirely by combustion of
fossil fuels, especially coal, in stationary sources such as power plants and smelters.
In contrast, the air pollution problem in many cities is caused by emissions of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and various volatile organic compounds that
swirl around in the atmosphere reacting with each other and with sunlight to form
photochemical smog. Although stationary sources also contribute to photochemical
smog, the problem is most closely associated with motor vehicles. A major effect of
efforts in the United States to control both sulfurous smog and photochemical smog
has been the elimination of those dramatic, peak concentrations of pollution that
were responsible for the air pollution episodes just mentioned. In their place, however, is the more insidious problem of morbidity and mortality increases associated
with long-term exposure to lower concentrations of pollution. The human toll is
much more difficult to document, but estimates place the current excess deaths
caused by air pollution (mostly small particles) at several tens of thousands per year
in the United States alone.
Much of the work on air pollution in the past few decades has centered on a
small set of six substances, called criteria pollutants, that have been identified as
contributors to both sulfurous and photochemical smog problems. The sources,
transport, effects, and methods of controlling these criteria pollutants will be a principal focus of this chapter.
More recently, attention has been shifting toward the characterization and
control of a growing list of especially hazardous air pollutants, many of which we
are exposed to in our homes and workplaces, where we spend roughly 90 percent of
our time. As the preceding quote suggests, modest improvements in indoor air quality can improve public health as much as major reductions in the traditional outdoor sources that have been the focus of most of the scientific and political efforts of
the past 50 years.

Overview of Emissions
There are many sources of the gases and particulate matter that pollute our atmosphere. Substances that are emitted directly into the atmosphere are called primary
pollutants, whereas others that are created by various physical processes and chemical reactions that take place in the atmosphere are called secondary pollutants. For
example, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons emitted when fuels are burned are

368

Air Pollution

primary pollutants, but the ozone that is created when those chemicals react with
each other in the atmosphere is a secondary pollutant.
The sources of primary pollutant emissions can be conveniently categorized by
the processes that create them. Most primary pollutants enter the atmosphere as a
result of combustion, evaporation, or grinding and abrasion. Automobile exhaust
emissions and power plant stack gases are created during combustion; volatile substances such as gasoline, paints, and cleaning fluids enter the atmosphere by evaporation; whereas dust kicked up when land is plowed and asbestos fibers that flake
off of pipe insulation are examples of grinding and abrasion. Of these, combustion
accounts for the great majority of emissions, and the gases and particulate matter
released when fuels are burned have been the focus of most of the technical and legislative pollution control efforts.
To investigate the origins of primary pollutants resulting from combustion, let’s
begin with complete combustion of a pure hydrocarbon fuel such as methane (CH4):
CH4 + 2 O2 : CO2 + 2 H2O

(1)

The products of combustion are simple carbon dioxide and water, neither of which
had been considered an air pollutant until we realized that the accumulation of CO2
in the atmosphere was enhancing Earth’s natural greenhouse effect.
If the temperature of combustion isn’t high enough, or there isn’t enough oxygen available, or if the fuel isn’t given enough time to burn completely, then the fuel
will not be completely oxidized, and some of the carbon will be released as carbon
monoxide (CO) instead of CO2. Also, some of the fuel will not be completely
burned, so there will be emissions of various partially combusted hydrocarbons that
we will represent by (HC). So we can write the following descriptive reaction to represent incomplete combustion of our pure hydrocarbon fuel, methane:
CH4 + O2 : mostly (CO2 + 2 H2O) + traces of [CO + (HC)]

(2)

Of course, most combustion takes place in air, not in a pure oxygen environment, and air is roughly 78 percent N2 and 21 percent O2. When the temperature of
combustion is high enough, some of that nitrogen reacts with the oxygen in air to
form various nitrogen oxides (NOx). Since this NOx is formed when combustion
temperatures are high, it is referred to as thermal NOx.
air (N2 + O2) + Heat : Thermal NOx

(3)

So far, we have assumed the fuel being burned was a pure hydrocarbon such as
methane. In reality, of course, most fuels have a number of other elements in them
such as nitrogen, sulfur, lead (in gasoline), mercury (in coal), and other unburnable
materials called ash. Burning fuel with these “impurities” in them releases additional
NOx (called fuel NOx), oxides of sulfur (SOx), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), more particulate matter, and ash.
Combining the effects of incomplete combustion, combustion in air, and combustion of fuels that are not pure hydrocarbons yields the following qualitative
description of combustion:
Fuel (H, C, S, N, Pb, Hg, ash) + Air (N2 + O2) :
Emissions (CO2, H2O, CO, NOx, SOx, Pb, Hg, particulates) + ash

(4)

369

Air Pollution

Now let’s add a simple representation of the photochemical reactions that produce
ozone (O3) and other constituents of photochemical smog. Hydrocarbons and other
organic compounds that readily vaporize are called volatile organic compounds
(VOCs). VOCs react with NOx in the presence of sunlight to produce photochemical
smog:
VOCs + NOx + Sunlight : Photochemical smog (O3 + etc.)

(5)

To distinguish between the ozone that is formed near the ground by (5) from the ozone
that exists in the stratosphere (next chapter), the designations ground-level ozone and
stratospheric ozone are sometimes used. As we shall see, ground-level ozone is harmful
to our health, whereas stratospheric ozone protects our health by shielding us from ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
Reactions (1) to (5) are greatly simplified, of course, but they do introduce the
principal players in air pollution: CO, NOx, SOx, O3, VOCs, Hg, Pb, and
particulate matter.
One way to approach emissions and controls of air pollutants is to categorize
the sources as being mobile sources or stationary sources. Mobile sources include
highway vehicles (automobiles and trucks), and other modes of transportation,
including railroads, aircraft, farm vehicles, and boats and ships. Stationary sources
are often categorized as stationary fuel combustion, which includes electric power
plants and industrial energy systems; industrial processes, such as metals processing,
petroleum refineries, and other chemical and allied product manufacturing; and
miscellaneous sources. Very roughly speaking, mobile sources are responsible for
most of the CO and almost half of the NOx, whereas stationary sources are responsible for most of the SOx, Hg, particulates, and VOCs, along with a bit more than half
of the NOx. As we shall see, regulatory approaches to controlling emissions, as well as
technologies used to do so, are quite different for mobile and stationary sources.

The Clean Air Act
Initial efforts on the part of the U.S. Congress to address the nation’s air pollution
problem began with the passage of the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955. Although
it provided funding only for research and not control, it was an important milestone
because it opened the door to federal participation in efforts to deal with air pollution. Until that time, it had been thought to be a state and local problem. This was
followed by a series of legislative actions by Congress that included the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1963, 1966, 1970, 1977, and 1990, all of which are sometimes
lumped together and referred to as simply the Clean Air Act (CAA). More recently,
Congress unsuccessfully attempted to modify the CAA with the controversial Clear
Skies Act of 2003, which many analysts say would have weakened the CAA. And, in
2005, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established a new “Clean Air
Mercury Rule” to create a market-based cap-and-trade program to reduce mercury
emissions from power plants. This Rule was challenged, but the courts reaffirmed it
in 2006.
Much of the real structure to the Clean Air Act was established in the 1970
Amendments. In those amendments, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

370

Air Pollution

(U.S. EPA) was required to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS), and states were required to submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) that
would show how they would meet those standards. In addition, the Act required
New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to be established that would limit emissions from certain specific types of industrial plants and from motor vehicles.

Air Quality and Emission Standards
The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to establish both air quality standards (NAAQS)
and emission standards (NSPS), and it is important to keep in mind the fundamental
difference between the two. Ambient air quality standards are acceptable concentrations of pollution in the atmosphere, whereas emission standards are allowable
rates at which pollutants can be released from a source.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards have been established by the EPA at
two levels: primary and secondary. Primary standards are required to be set at levels
that will protect public health and include an “adequate margin of safety,” regardless of whether the standards are economically or technologically achievable.
Primary standards must protect even the most sensitive individuals, including the
elderly and those already suffering from respiratory and cardiopulmonary disorders.
NAAQS are, therefore, conceptually different from Maximum Contaminant Levels
(MCLs) that have been set for drinking water. Recall that the Safe Drinking Water
Act requires the EPA to balance public health benefits with technological and economic feasibility in establishing drinking water MCLs.
Secondary air quality standards are meant to be even more stringent than
primary standards. Secondary standards are established to protect public welfare
(e.g., structures, crops, animals, fabrics, etc.). Given the difficulty in achieving primary standards, secondary standards have played almost no role in air pollution
control policy, and, in fact, they have usually been set at the same levels as primary
standards.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards now exist for six criteria pollutants:
carbon monoxide (CO), lead (Pb), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ground-level ozone (O3),
sulfur dioxide (SO2), and two categories of particulate matter (Table 1). The Clean
Air Act requires that the list of criteria pollutants be reviewed periodically and that
standards be adjusted according to the latest scientific information. Past reviews
have modified both the list of pollutants and their acceptable concentrations. For
example, lead has been added to the list, and the broad category of hydrocarbons
has been dropped. The older standard for a general category of “oxidants” has been
replaced by a more specific ozone standard. And in 2005, the one-hour-averagingtime O3 standard was dropped (in all but a very limited number of regions of the
country), but the eight-hour standard remains. Also, very importantly, the original
particulate standard did not refer to the size of particulates, but as of 1987, it was
modified to include only particles with an aerodynamic diameter of less than, or
equal to, 10 micrometers (PM10). Ten years later, in 1997, an additional fine particles category for particulates smaller than 2.5 microns was added (PM2.5). In 2006,
the short-term PM2.5 standard was cut from 65 to 35mg/m3, and the long-term standard was revoked.
The rules for determining whether a region of the country is in compliance
with NAAQS are rather complicated. For CO and SOx, for example, the standards

cannot be exceeded more than once per calendar year. For most of the others, compliance is based on a running three-year average. It should be noted that the law
allows states to establish standards that are more stringent than the NAAQS, which
California has done.
For the gases in Table 1, the concentrations may be expressed in parts per million by volume (ppm) as well as in mass per unit volume (mg/m3 or mg/m3). The volumetric units (ppm) are preferred since those are independent of pressure and
temperature. The mass-per-volume concentrations assume a temperature of 25°C
and 1 atmosphere of pressure. The following example illustrates the procedure.

EXAMPLE 1 Air Quality Standards as Mass per Unit Volume
Table 1 shows that California’s air quality one-hour standard for NO2 is
0.25 ppm. Express this as a concentration by mass at 25°C and 1 atm pressure.
Solution 1 mol of an ideal gas at 1 atm and 25°C occupies a volume of 24.465
L (24.465 * 10 - 3 m3). The molecular weight of NO2 is
MW = 1 * 14 + 2 * 16 = 46 g/mol

372

Air Pollution

therefore
[NO2] =

0.25 * 10 - 6 m3(NO2)/m3(air) * 46 g/mol
24.465 * 10 - 3 m3/mol

= 470 * 10 - 6 g/m3 = 470 mg/m3
Notice that parts per million by volume (ppm) is a dimensionless volume fraction, independent of temperature and pressure, so it is the preferred measure.

Besides establishing National Ambient Air Quality Standards, the Clean Air
Act also requires the EPA to establish emission standards for mobile sources such as
cars and trucks. The 1970 Amendments to the Clean Air Act gave the auto industry
a five-year deadline to achieve a 90-percent reduction in emissions from new cars.
At the time, it was not even known whether such reductions were technologically
possible, let alone how they could be implemented in such a short period of time.
This “technology-forcing” legislation predictably led to numerous clashes between
Congress and the automobile industry, and the standards were modified and delayed for many years. Later in this chapter, the emission controls that eventually
were implemented will be described in some detail.
The EPA is also required to establish emissions standards for certain large
stationary sources such as fossil-fuel-fired power plants, incinerators, Portland
cement plants, nitric acid plants, petroleum refineries, sewage treatment plants, and
smelters of various sorts. The methods of achieving the emission standards for
stationary sources will be explored later in this chapter.

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977
The goal of the 1970 Amendments was to attain clean air by 1975, as defined by the
NAAQS, with allowable extensions in certain circumstances until 1977. For a number of reasons, only about one-third of the air quality control regions in the nation
were meeting the standards by 1977. This forced Congress to re-address the problem through the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977. Besides extending the deadlines, the 1977 Amendments had to deal with two important questions. First, what
measures should be taken in nonattainment areas that were not meeting the standards? Second, should air quality in regions where the air is cleaner than the standards be allowed to degrade toward the standards, and if so, by how much?
For nonattainment areas, the 1970 Act appeared to prohibit any increase in
emissions whatsoever, which would have eliminated industrial expansion and severely
curtailed local economic growth. To counter this, the EPA adopted a policy of
emission offsets. To receive a construction permit, a major new source of pollution in
a nonattainment area must first find ways to reduce emissions from existing sources.
The reductions, or offsets, must exceed the anticipated emissions from the new
source. The net effect of this offset policy is that progress is made toward meeting air
quality standards in spite of new emission sources being added to the airshed.
Offsets can be obtained in a number of ways. For example, emissions from
existing sources in the area might be reduced by installing better emission controls
on equipment that may, or may not, be owned by the permit seeker. In some cases, a

373

Air Pollution

permit seeker may simply buy out existing emission sources and shut them down.
Emission offsets can be “banked” for future use, or they can be sold or traded to
other companies for whatever the market will bear. In addition to offsets, new
sources in nonattainment areas must use emission controls that yield the Lowest
Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) for the particular process. LAER technology is
based on the most stringent emission rate achieved in practice by similar sources,
regardless of the economic cost or energy impacts.
The 1970 Amendments were not specific about regions that were cleaner than
ambient standards required and in fact appeared to allow air quality to deteriorate
to those standards. The 1977 Amendments settled the issue of whether or not this
would be allowed by establishing the concept of prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) in attainment areas. Attainment areas are put into one of three classes
and the amount of deterioration allowed is determined by the class. In PSD areas,
Best Available Control Technology (BACT) is required on major new sources.
BACT is less stringent than LAER, as it does allow consideration of economic, energy,
and environmental impacts of the technology, but it can be more strict than allowed
by NSPS. In all PSD areas, the allowable increments of air quality degradation are
constrained by the NAAQS. That is, in no circumstance would air quality be
allowed to deteriorate to the point where the area is no longer in compliance with
ambient air quality standards.

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 significantly strengthened the EPA’s efforts
to assure healthful air in the United States and broadened its scope to include control of pollutants that affect a global problem—stratospheric ozone depletion.
Principal changes in the Act included the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Creation of a new Acid Rain Program (Title IV)
New requirements for nonattainment areas (Title I)
Tightened automobile emission standards and new fuel requirements (Title II)
New toxic air pollution controls (Title I)
Phase-out schedule for ozone-depleting substances (Title VI)

The Acid Rain Program. One of the most important shortcomings of the Clean
Air Act before the 1990 Amendments was its inability to deal effectively with acid
rain (or, more correctly, acid deposition). As will be described later, acid deposition
results from emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) that convert to sulfuric acid and
nitrogen oxides (NOx) that become nitric acid. The 1990 Amendments approached
this problem in a new and creative way by creating a market-based “cap-and-trade”
system to control emissions.
The cap-and-trade system is based on a more flexible allowance system, where
one allowance authorizes the owner to emit 1 ton of SO2. Large coal-fired power
plants are not allowed to emit any more tons of SO2 than the number of allowances
they own. If insufficient allowances are owned to cover emissions, the owners are
subject to an excess-emissions penalty. The intent is for these allowances to be
bought and sold or banked in the same way that other commodities are traded. New
sources that have no allowances have to purchase them from existing sources or

374

Air Pollution

from annual EPA auctions. The idea, of course, is that major sources will find the
least-expensive ways to cut their emissions and then sell some of their allowances
to others who can’t reduce their emissions as cheaply. The goal is a least-cost emission limitation that allows sources the flexibility they need to make the most costeffective choices. By ratcheting down the number of allowances that the EPA issues
each year, the cap placed on total emission is intended to result in a 50 percent
reduction in SO2 emissions from 1980 levels by 2010.
The cap-and-trade system went into effect in 1995, so we now have more than
a decade of results to use to evaluate how well it is working. A recent study by
Chestnut and Mills (2005) concludes the program is accomplishing much more than
expected, at far less cost than anticipated. Between 1993 and 2002, the EPA’s Acid
Rain Program resulted in an SO2 emission reduction of over 30 percent, and it is
well on its way to meeting its 2010 goal of cutting emissions in half compared to
1980 emissions.
Success with the SO2 cap-and-trade program led to a similar effort to control
NOx emissions called the NOx Budget Trading Program (NBP). The program became operational in 2003, and early results are promising. In 2005, out of the 2,570
NOx emitters affected under NBP, all but 3 sources were in compliance, and emissions were 11 percent lower than 2004 and 57 percent lower than in 2000 before
implementation of the NBP (U.S. EPA, 2006a).
By switching to lower-sulfur coal (which also contains less mercury) and installing scrubbers, not only have SOx and NOx been reduced, as Title IV intended,
but also highly toxic mercury emissions have been cut as well as ambient levels of
PM2.5 and ozone. The combined annual health and welfare benefits in 2010 of the
Acid Rain Program in the United States and southern Canada are estimated to be
over $120 billion (over 90 percent of which is attributable to projected reductions in
PM2.5), whereas the annual costs of SOx and NOx controls is estimated at only
$3 billion (Chestnut and Mills, 2005). Table 2 summarizes the emission reductions
projected for 2010 attributable to Title IV.
National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP).
Earlier versions of the Clean Air Act established NESHAP, and through it, a small
list of pollutants (asbestos, benzene, beryllium, coke oven emissions, inorganic
arsenic, mercury, radionuclides, and vinyl chloride) were controlled. The 1990
Amendments extend that list to include 189 pollutants listed in the legislation. The
list can be changed by the EPA, and if there are objections to any additions, the
burden of proof is on the petitioner, who must show that the chemical may not

effects. Emission standards for chemicals on the list are based on the Maximum
Achievable Control Technology (MACT).
Ozone Depleting Substances. Finally, Title VI of the 1990 Amendments was
written to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The phase-out was mandated to be at
least as strict as that required by the international treaty known as the Montreal
Protocol.

Progress in Controlling Emissions
and Improving Air Quality
The Clean Air Act has definitely helped reduce emissions of the key criteria pollutants, and the resulting air quality improvements are significant. As Figure 1 indicates, emissions of CO, NOx, SOx, and VOCs have been cut in half compared with
1970 levels, and with the 1995 elimination of lead as an antiknock additive in gasoline, those emissions have dropped 98 percent. PM10 is down significantly, but NOx
remains a more difficult pollutant to control, with emissions down only 17 percent.
Since ozone is a secondary pollutant—that is, it is not actually emitted but rather is
formed by photochemical reactions that take place in the atmosphere—it is not
shown in this emissions figure. Instead, VOCs are used as indicators of the potential
for ozone formation.
Those emission reductions over the past 30 years are even more impressive
when compared with the growth in key factors that would normally be tied to
pollutant emissions. As shown in Figure 2, while an aggregate of these six key pollutants has dropped by half, U.S. population and energy consumption have grown
by about 40 percent, while GDP and vehicle miles traveled have more than doubled.

The NAAQS form the basis for the EPA’s Air Quality Index (AQI), which is
used to report to the public an overall assessment of a given day’s air quality. The
AQI integrates air quality data for five of the criteria pollutants into a single number
that represents the worst daily air quality in an urban area. Descriptive terms ranging from “good” to “hazardous” are assigned to ranges of the AQI, as shown in
Table 3, and messages such as the following may be issued in local weather reports.
An AQI value of 100 indicates that at least one pollutant has just reached its ambient air quality standard on that day. An index of 500 indicates an imminent and
substantial endangerment to public health.
• Good (0–50): No health impacts are expected in this range.
• Moderate (51–100): Unusually sensitive people should consider reducing
prolonged or heavy exertion.
• Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101–150): Active children and adults, and
people with lung disease, such as asthma, should reduce prolonged or heavy
exertion outdoors. The general public is not likely to be affected.
• Unhealthy (151–200): Everyone may begin to experience health effects.
Members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.
• Very Unhealthy (201–300): Air quality in this range triggers a health alert,
meaning everyone may experience more serious health effects.
• Hazardous (301–500): Air quality in this range triggers health warnings of
emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected.

Air Pollution

The number of days that the AQI is above 100 is often used to describe
progress that is being made in air quality. Since almost all such days are triggered by
high levels of ozone, special attention is paid to that criteria pollutant. A special
network of Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMs) has been established in ozone nonattainment areas that report detailed data for ozone and its
precursors. Figure 3 shows that PAMS sites, in general, have not shown much
reduction in the number of days with AQI above 100 in the 1990s; however, during
the same period of time, California saw a reduction of over half.
While the gains shown in Figures 1 to 3 are impressive, roughly half of the U.S.
population lives in counties where at least one NAAQS continues to be exceeded.
The pollutant most responsible for those excessive exposures is ground-level ozone
(Figure 4). Equally disturbing is the fact that 20 percent live in counties where the
more lethal PM2.5 pollution doesn’t meet its air quality standard.

Criteria Pollutants
Given the ongoing focus of the Clean Air Act, most of the monitoring of emissions,
concentrations, and effects of air pollution has been directed toward the six criteria
pollutants: ground-level ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2),
small particulates (PM10 and now PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and lead (Pb).
The original ambient air quality standards for these pollutants were based on extensive documentation assembled and published by the EPA in a multivolume set of Air
Quality Criteria documents, from which the name criteria pollutants originated.

Carbon Monoxide
Over two-thirds of the mass of all the pollutant emissions in the United States is the
colorless, odorless, tasteless, poisonous gas, carbon monoxide (CO). It is produced
when carbonaceous fuels are burned under less than ideal conditions. Incomplete
combustion, yielding CO instead of CO2, results when any of the following four
variables are not kept sufficiently high: (1) oxygen supply, (2) combustion temperature, (3) gas residence time at high temperature, and (4) combustion chamber turbulence. These parameters are generally under much tighter control in stationary
sources such as power plants than in motor vehicles, and CO emissions are correspondingly less. For example, power plants, which are designed and managed for
maximum combustion-efficiency, produce less than 1 percent of all CO emissions in
spite of the fact that they consume about 30 percent of our fossil fuel.
Over 80 percent of total CO emissions are from the transportation sector, and
almost all of the CO in urban areas comes from motor vehicles. Hourly atmospheric
concentrations of CO over our cities often reflect city driving patterns: peaks occur on
weekdays during the morning and late afternoon rush hours, while on weekends there
is typically but one lower peak in the late afternoon. Personal exposure to CO is very
much determined by the proximity of motor vehicle traffic, with some occupational
groups such as cab drivers, police, and parking lot attendants receiving far higher
than average doses. Carbon monoxide emissions from motor vehicles decreased by
41 percent in the past 20 years (1983–2002) despite a doubling in vehicle-miles traveled. The impact of tightening emission controls, coupled with a drop in the fraction
of older, more polluting cars still on the road, is clearly evident.
At levels of CO that occur in urban air, there are apparently no detrimental
effects on materials or plants; those levels can, however, adversely affect human
health. Carbon monoxide is an asphyxiant; it interferes with the blood’s ability to
carry oxygen from the lungs to the body’s organs and tissues. When inhaled, it readily
binds to hemoglobin in the bloodstream to form carboxyhemoglobin (COHb).
Hemoglobin, in fact, has a much greater affinity for carbon monoxide than it does for
oxygen, so that even small amounts of CO can seriously reduce the amount of oxygen
conveyed throughout the body. With the bloodstream carrying less oxygen, brain
function is affected and heart rate increases in an attempt to offset the oxygen deficit.
The usual way to express the amount of carboxyhemoglobin in the blood is as
a percentage of the saturation level, %COHb. The amount of COHb formed in the
blood is related to the CO concentration and the length of time exposed, as suggested in the following.
%COHb = b(1 - egt)[CO]

standard).
Solution

From (6):

%COHb = 0.15%>ppm[1 - exp(0.402/hr * 1 hr)][35 ppm] = 1.7 percent
Physiological effects can be noted at small percentages of COHb, increasing in
severity as the concentration increases. The elderly, the fetus, and individuals who
suffer from cardiovascular disease, particularly those with angina pectoris (a heart
condition characterized by chest pain) or peripheral vascular disease, are the most
sensitive to COHb since the heart must work harder in an attempt to offset the
reduction in oxygen. Studies of patients with angina have shown an earlier-thanusual onset of pain during exercise when levels are as low as 2 percent COHb. In
Example 3, it was calculated that an individual breathing CO at the federal ambient
air quality standard of 35 ppm for one hour would be likely to reach 1.7 percent
COHb. That is very close to the level at which health effects have been noted, and
the federal standard has been criticized as a result. California’s CO standard has
been set lower (20 ppm) in an attempt to assure less than 2 percent COHb.
The reduction of oxygen in the bloodstream also affects the brain’s ability to
perceive and react. At 2.5 percent COHb, studies have shown an impairment in timeinterval discrimination. (Subjects were less able to distinguish the duration of a tone
signal.) Studies have also shown that at 5 percent, psychomotor response times may
be affected, and patients with heart disease experience increased physiological stress.
At 5 to 17 percent, manual dexterity, ability to learn, and performance in complex
sensorimotor tasks such as driving are diminished. At 10 percent, headache is common, and at 30 percent COHb, most people will experience dizziness, headache,
fatigue, and impaired judgment. Concentrations above 60 percent produce loss of
consciousness and death if exposure continues.
Carbon monoxide concentrations near busy roadways frequently range from
5 to 50 ppm, and measurements made on congested highways indicate that drivers
can be exposed to CO concentrations of 100 ppm. Carbon monoxide is an important pollutant in indoor air as well. Cigarette smoke contains more than 400 ppm
CO, and smokers frequently have COHb levels between 5 and 10 percent. Tobacco
smoke in bars and restaurants often raises indoor CO levels to 20 to 30 ppm, which
is close to the one-hr ambient standard (Wadden and Scheff, 1983). Fortunately,
COHb is removed from the bloodstream when clean air is breathed. Healthy subjects clear about half of the CO from their blood in three to four hours, so adverse
effects are usually temporary.

Oxides of Nitrogen
Although 7 oxides of nitrogen are known to occur, NO, NO2, NO3, N2O, N2O3,
N2O4, and N2O5—the only two that are important air pollutants are nitric oxide
(NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). As mentioned earlier, there are two sources of
nitrogen oxides (or NOx) when fossil fuels are burned. Thermal NOx is created when
nitrogen and oxygen in the combustion air are heated to a high enough temperature
(about 1,000 K) to oxidize the nitrogen. Fuel NOx results from the oxidation of
nitrogen compounds that are chemically bound in the fuel molecules themselves.
Different fuels have different amounts of nitrogen in them, with natural gas having
almost none and some coal having as much 3 percent by weight. Both thermal NOx
and fuel NOx can be significant contributors to the total NOx emissions, but fuel
NOx often is the dominant source. In 2003, transportation accounted for 57 percent
of emissions, whereas stationary fuel combustion emitted 37 percent.
About 95 percent of anthropogenic emissions of NOx are in the form of NO,
which is a colorless gas that has no known adverse health effects at concentrations
found in the atmosphere. However, NO readily oxidizes to NO2, and NO2 can irritate the lungs, cause bronchitis and pneumonia, and lower resistance to respiratory
infections. NOx also can react with volatile organic compounds in the presence of
sunlight to form photochemical oxidants that have adverse health consequences
as well.
Nitrogen dioxide has other environmental consequences besides those directly
associated with human health. It reacts with the hydroxyl radical (OH) in the

382

Air Pollution

atmosphere to form nitric acid (HNO3) that corrodes metal surfaces and contributes
to the acid rain problem. It also can cause damage to terrestrial plants, and it is a
significant cause of eutrophication, especially in nitrogen-limited estuaries such as
Chesapeake Bay. Nitrogen dioxide is responsible for the reddish-brown color in the
smog that hovers over cities like Los Angeles.
Reductions in NOx emissions have been harder to come by than reductions in
other criteria pollutants. In fact, emissions increased for several decades after the
original Clean Air Act was passed, due in part to early automobile emission controls
that focused on reducing CO emissions at the expense of increasing NOx. Since
then, better technology and more stringent standards applied to new cars and lightduty trucks are beginning to turn the corner. Emissions of NOx from these vehicles
peaked in 1994 and are now on the decline, but emissions from heavy-duty gasoline
vehicles, diesel trucks, and nonroad vehicles are still increasing (U.S. EPA, 2003).
Increasing transportation-sector emissions have been offset by reductions in emissions from power plants and other stationary sources.
Despite difficulties in controlling NOx emissions, every monitoring location in
the United States meets the NAAQS for NO2, and a large majority of the sites have
concentrations of less than half of the standards.

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
This class of compounds consists of volatile compounds that enter the atmosphere
when solvents, fuels, and other organics evaporate, along with unburned and partially burned hydrocarbons that are emitted from tailpipes and smoke stacks when
fossil fuels are not completely combusted. Regulation of VOCs is based on their role
as precursors to the formation of photochemical smog. As such, the less-reactive
hydrocarbon, methane, is often excluded, and the remainder is referred to as Total
Non-Methane Organic Compounds (TNMOC).
In addition to anthropogenic sources (manmade, excluding wildfires and
prescribed burnings), there are natural sources of reactive hydrocarbons such as oaks,
spruce, eucalyptus, and citrus trees that emit isoprene; and maple, hickory, pine,
spruce, and fir trees that emit monoterpenes. In some regions of the country, mostly in
the east, these biogenic sources can be greater than anthropogenic VOC emissions.
The transportation sector is responsible for almost half of anthropogenic VOC
emissions, and despite rapidly rising miles driven in motor vehicles, emissions
decreased by 39 percent from 1993 to 2003. Reformulated gasoline with lower
volatility coupled with the decline in the percentage of dirtier, older vehicles on the
road account for much of the drop. As emissions from motor vehicles become less
significant, other sources such as gasoline-powered lawnmowers, outboard motors,
barbeque starter fluids, and oil-based paints begin to look much more important
and are beginning to be regulated as well.
Industrial sources account for almost all of the other half of VOC emissions,
with much of that again being caused by vaporization of hydrocarbons. Less than
2 percent of VOCs result from fossil-fuel combustion in power plants and industrial
boilers.
In terms of direct human health effects of VOCs, it is our exposure to a long
list of volatile and toxic compounds inside our buildings that provides our greatest
risk.

383

Air Pollution

Photochemical Smog and Ozone
When NOx, VOCs, and sunlight come together, they can initiate a complex set of
reactions that produce a number of secondary pollutants known as photochemical
oxidants. Ozone (O3) is the most abundant of the photochemical oxidants, and it
is the one for which an ambient air quality standard has been written. Although
it is responsible for many of the undesirable properties of photochemical smog,
from chest constriction and irritation of the mucous membrane in people to the
cracking of rubber products and damage to vegetation, it is not a cause of the
eye irritation that is our most common complaint about smog. Eye irritation is
caused by other components of photochemical smog, principally formaldehyde
(HCHO), peroxybenzoyl nitrate (PBzN), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), and acrolein
(CH2CHCOH).
In the very simplest of terms, we can express the formation of photochemical
smog as
VOCs + NOx + Sunlight : Photochemical smog
(7)
The reaction in (7) only gives us the simplest overview. We will add a few details to
give a sense of the key reactions involved, but a complete analysis is far beyond the
scope of this book.
The NO ¬ NO2 ¬ O3 Photochemical Reaction Sequence. Consider some of
the important reactions involving NOx without the complications associated with
the added hydrocarbons. We can begin with the formation of NO during combustion (for simplicity, we just show the thermal NOx reaction):
N2 + O2 : 2 NO

(8)

The nitric oxide thus emitted can oxidize to NO2:
2 NO + O2 : 2 NO2

(9)

If sunlight is available, a photon with the right amount of energy can decompose
NO2 in a process called photolysis.
NO2 + hn : NO + O

(10)

where hn represents a photon (with wavelength l 6 0.39 mm). The freed atomic
oxygen (O) can then combine with diatomic oxygen (O2) to form ozone (O3):
O + O2 + M : O3 + M

(11)

where M represents a molecule (usually O2 or N2 since they are most abundant in
air) whose presence is necessary to absorb excess energy from the reaction. Without
M, the ozone would have too much energy to be stable, and it would dissociate back
to O and O2.
Ozone can then convert NO back to NO2,
O3 + NO : NO2 + O2

(12)

Notice the general tendency for NO2 to create O3 (10) and (11), whereas NO tends
to destroy O3 (12).
Equations (8) to (12) help explain the sequence of stages through which
atmospheric NO, NO2, and O3 progress on a typical smoggy day. They suggest NO

concentrations would rise as early morning traffic emits its load of NO. Then, as the
morning progresses, we would expect to see a drop in NO and a rise in NO2 as
NO gets converted to NO2. As the sun’s intensity increases toward noon, the rate of
photolysis of NO2 increases; thus, NO2 begins to drop while O3 rises. Ozone is so
effective in its reaction with NO (12) that as long as there is O3 present, NO concentrations do not rise through the rest of the afternoon even though there may be new
emissions.
The nitrogen dioxide photolytic cycle helps provide an explanation for the
sequence NO to NO2 to O3 observable in both laboratory smog chambers and in
cities such as Los Angeles (see Figure 6). A careful analysis of the reactions, however, predicts O3 concentrations that are much lower than those frequently found on
smoggy days. If only the NO2 photolytic cycle is involved, O3 cannot accumulate in
sufficient quantity to explain actual measured data. By introducing certain types of
hydrocarbons into the cycle, however, the balance of production and destruction of
O3 can be upset, which allows more O3 to accumulate, closing the gap between
theoretical and actual levels.
Hydrocarbons and NOx. Expanding the nitrogen dioxide photolytic cycle to include hydrocarbons and other organics helps explain the increase in ozone above
what would be predicted by the NOx cycle alone. It also enables us to account for
some of the other objectionable organic compounds found in photochemical smog.
The chemistry of photochemical smog is exceedingly complex. A multitude of
organic chemicals are introduced to the atmosphere when fuels burn or volatiles
evaporate, and many more are produced in the atmosphere as a result of chemical

385

Air Pollution

reactions. To help describe some of these reactions, let us begin with a very brief explanation of some of the nomenclature and notation used in organic chemistry.
We begin by considering atoms or molecules with an odd number of electrons,
called free radicals. Having an odd number of electrons means that one electron is
not being used as a bonding electron to other atoms. For example, a carbon atom
bonded to three hydrogens has one leftover electron. We can represent that molecule
with the notation CH•3, where the dot suggests the unpaired electron. Free radicals
tend to be very reactive, and they are very important in the study of air pollution.
The alkanes are hydrocarbons in which each carbon forms single bonds with
other atoms. The alkane series is the familiar sequence: methane (CH4), ethane
(C2H6), propane (C3H8), . . . (CnH2n + 2). If one of the hydrogens is removed from
an alkane, the resulting free radical is called an alkyl. The alkyls then form a series
beginning with methyl (CH•3), ethyl (C2H•5), and so on. We could represent an alkyl
with the general expression CnH•2n + 1, but it is more convenient to call it simply R•.
Another basic chemical unit that comes up over and over again in the study of
photochemical smog is a carbonyl, a carbon atom with a double bond joining it to an
oxygen as shown in the following diagram. A carbonyl with one bond shared with
an alkyl, R•, and the other with a hydrogen atom, forms an aldehyde. Aldehydes can
thus be written as RCHO. The simplest aldehyde is formaldehyde (HCHO), which
corresponds to R• being just a single hydrogen atom. A more complex aldehyde is
acrolein, as shown. Both formaldehyde and acrolein are eye-irritating components of
photochemical smog.

Another important key to understanding atmospheric organic chemistry is the
hydroxyl radical OH•, which is formed when atomic oxygen reacts with water:
O + H2O : 2 OH•

(13)

The OH radical is extremely reactive, and its atmospheric concentration is so low
that it has been difficult to detect. Nevertheless, it plays a key role in many reactions, including the oxidations of NO2 to nitric acid and CO to CO2.
OH• + NO2 : HNO3
OH• + CO : CO2 + H•

(14)
(15)

In fact, the hydroxyl radical is responsible for initiating the oxidation of VOCs and
most of the other important atmospheric pollutants. It is therefore crucial to the
natural removal of pollution from the atmosphere.
It was mentioned previously that the NO2 photolytic cycle, by itself, underpredicts the observed concentrations of O3. As that cycle is described in (10) to (12), the
availability of NO2 affects the rate of production of O3, whereas the availability
of NO affects the rate of destruction of O3. The balance of O3 production and
destruction can be upset if there are other reactions that will enhance the rate of
conversion of NO to NO2. Any reactions that will help convert NO to NO2 will

increase O3 concentrations both by reducing the amount of NO available to destroy
O3, and increasing the amount of NO2 available to create O3.
The following three reactions provide one explanation for the way that hydrocarbons can enhance the rate of conversion of NO to NO2 and hence increase O3
concentrations. Starting with a hydrocarbon RH, we have
RH + OH• : R• + H2O
R• + O2 : RO•2
RO•2 + NO : RO• + NO2

(16)
(17)
(18)

These reactions are not complete, although they do show how hydrocarbons can
help convert NO to NO2, and thus increase O3. As written, an already scarce
hydroxyl OH• is required to start the chain, and it appears to be destroyed in the
process. Unless there is some way to rejuvenate that OH•, these reactions could not
continue for long. The following pair of reactions shows one way that not only OH•
is regenerated, but also, in the process, how another NO is converted to NO2. An
aldehyde can also be formed from this pair of reactions:
RO• + O2 : HO•2 + R¿CHO
HO•2

•

+ NO : NO2 + OH

(19)
(20)

where R⬘ is the hydrocarbon that balances (19).
The net effect of reactions (16) through (20) is that one hydrocarbon molecule
converts two molecules of NO to NO2 and produces an aldehyde R⬘CHO. The
removal of NO by these reactions slows the rate at which O3 is removed from the
atmosphere, while the addition of NO2 increases the rate at which it is produced,
which allows higher levels of O3 to accumulate in the air. These are summarized in
Figure 7.

387

Air Pollution

EXAMPLE 3 Ethane to Acetaldehyde
Suppose the hydrocarbon that begins reactions (16) through (20) is ethane
(C2H6). Write the sequence of reactions.
Solution The hydrocarbon RH that appears in (16) is ethane, C2H6, so the
free radical R• is C2H•5. Reaction (16) thus becomes
C2H6 + OH• : C2H•5 + H2O
Reactions 17 to 19 are
C2H•5 + O2 : C2H5O•2
C2H5O•2 + NO : C2H5O• + NO2
C2H5O• + O2 : HO•2 + CH3CHO
Notice that R¿ in reaction 19 is thus CH•3. Finally, (20) is
HO•2 + NO : NO2 + OH•
The CH3CHO produced is an aldehyde called acetaldehyde. As we shall see, it
plays a role in the formation of the eye irritant peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN).
There are other ways that NO can be converted to NO2. Carbon monoxide,
for example, can do it too, in reactions that are similar to those given previously.
Starting with CO and OH•, as in (15)
OH• + CO : CO2 + H•

(15)

The hydrogen atom then quickly combines with O2 to form the hydroperoxyl radical, HO•2:
H• + O2 : HO•2
(21)
Now, going back to (20), NO is converted NO2:
HO•2 + NO : NO2 + OH•

(20)

So we see one way that another of our criteria pollutants, CO, can contribute to the
photochemical smog problem. By increasing the rate at which NO is converted to
NO2, CO aids in the accumulation of O3.
We can also extend these relationships to show the formation of another of the
eye irritants, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN).

The resulting acetylperoxy radical can react with NO2 to create PAN:

Air Pollution

It must be pointed out once again that the preceding reactions are only a very
limited description of the complex chemistry going on each day in the atmosphere
over our cities.
Sources and Effects of Photochemical Oxidants. Since ozone and other
photochemical oxidants are not primary pollutants, there is no direct way to specify
emissions. An annual emissions inventory is kept by the EPA, however, for the precursors to photochemical oxidants, namely NOx and VOCs. When all precursors are
considered, especially if an adjustment is made for the sources’ proximity to cities, the
automobile is the dominant cause of photochemical smog. Conditions in Los Angeles,
for example, are ideal for smog formation: the near total dependence on the automobile for transportation results in high hydrocarbon and NOx emissions; long lasting
atmospheric inversions restrict the vertical dispersion of pollutants; a ring of mountains nearly surrounds the city on three sides, reducing the horizontal dispersion; and
an abundance of sunshine powers the photochemical reactions.
Photochemical smog is known to cause many annoying respiratory effects, such
as coughing, shortness of breath, airway constriction, headache, chest tightness, and
eye, nose, and throat irritation. These symptoms can be especially severe for asthmatics and others with impaired respiratory systems, but even healthy individuals who
engage in strenuous exercise for relatively modest periods of time experience these
symptoms at levels near the ambient air quality standard. Animal studies suggest that
long-term exposures to ozone can lead to permanent scarring of lung tissue, loss of
lung function, and reduced lung elasticity. As shown in Figure 4, 136 million people in
the United States live in areas where ozone levels exceed national standards, far more
than are exposed to any other criteria pollutant. As mentioned earlier, the Clean Air
Act requires the EPA to set air quality standards that protect public health, without regard to cost. Accumulating evidence showed the two-decades-old 0.12 ppm ozone
standard did not adequately protect some individuals, especially children and those
with asthma. In 1997, after considerable public debate, the EPA strengthened the
ozone standard to 0.08 ppm, contending that 1 million fewer incidences of decreased
lung function in children each year could be realized if the standard is finally met.
Ozone has been shown to cause damage to tree foliage and to reduce growth
rates of certain sensitive tree species. Ozone that enters plant leaves through stomatal
openings produces byproducts that interfere with photosynthesis, which reduces crop
yields for many important agricultural crops, such as corn, wheat, soybeans, and
peanuts. Crop damage caused by motor-vehicle ozone alone has been estimated to
cause losses of $2 to $3 billion per year (Murphy et al., 1999).

Particulate Matter
Atmospheric particulate matter consists of any dispersed matter, solid or liquid, in
which the individual aggregates range from molecular clusters of 0.005 micrometers
(mm) diameter to coarse particles up to about 100 mm (roughly the size of a human
hair). As a category of criteria pollutant, particulate matter is extremely diverse and
complex since size and chemical composition, as well as atmospheric concentration,
are important characteristics.
A number of terms are used to categorize particulates, depending on their size
and phase (liquid or solid). The most general term is aerosol, which applies to any
tiny particles, liquid or solid, dispersed in the atmosphere. Solid particles are called

389

Air Pollution

dusts if they are caused by grinding or crushing operations. Solid particles are called
fumes if they are formed when vapors condense. Liquid particles may be called mist,
or more loosely, fog. Smoke and soot are terms used to describe particles composed
primarily of carbon that result from incomplete combustion. Smog is a term that
was derived from smoke and fog, originally referring to particulate matter but now
describing air pollution in general.
Particulate matter (PM) can be emitted directly as carbonaceous soot particles
from incomplete combustion, or it can be formed in the atmosphere, as, for example, when gaseous SO2 and NOx emissions are transformed into liquid droplets of
sulfates (sulfuric acid) and nitrates (nitric acid). In the eastern part of the United
States, with its greater reliance on coal-fired power plants, sulfates (and associated
ammonium) are the most important components of PM, whereas in California
and other areas of the West, carbon (soot) and nitrates dominate.
Size and Chemical Composition. The original NAAQS for particulates did not
take size into account. Larger particles could dominate the mass per unit volume measure but be unimportant in terms of human health risk. In 1987, however, the PM10
standard was introduced, and in 1997 the PM2.5 standard was added. Particles smaller
than 2.5 mm (i.e., PM2.5) are referred to as fine particles, whereas those between
2.5 mm and 10 mm are the coarse fraction of PM10. Coarse particles tend to settle
quickly, so their spatial impact is limited to areas near their source, but fine particles
have longer atmospheric lifetimes and are capable of traveling vast distances. For
example, a well-studied dust storm that originated in the Gobi Desert in Asia on April 6,
2001, traveled eastward over the globe, impacting PM2.5 measurements on the West
Coast of the United States a week later and on the East Coast two weeks later.
Although particles may have very irregular shapes, their size can be described by
an equivalent aerodynamic diameter determined by comparing them with perfect
spheres having the same settling velocity. The particles of most interest have aerodynamic diameters in the range of 0.1 mm to 10 mm (roughly the size of bacteria).
Particles smaller than these undergo random (Brownian) motion and, through coagulation, generally grow to sizes larger than 0.1 mm. Particles larger than 10 mm settle
quickly; a 10 mm particle, for example, has a settling velocity of approximately
20 centimeters per minute.
We can use a fairly simple analysis to calculate the settling velocity of a spherical particle. When such a particle reaches its terminal velocity, the gravitational
force pulling it down is balanced by a drag force that we can estimate. For particles
that are larger than about 1 mm, with density much greater than air, we can use a
simplified version of Stokes’s law to approximate the drag force:

EXAMPLE 4 Settling Velocity of a Spherical Particle
Find the settling velocity of a spherical droplet of water with diameter 2 mm, and
estimate the residence time of such particles if they are uniformly distributed in
the lower 1,000 m of atmosphere and their removal rate is determined by how
fast they settle in still air.

Using (24) with the density of water equal to 106g/m3 gives

n = 1.27 * 10 - 4 m/s
which is about 0.5 m/hr.
We can use a simple box model to estimate the residence time, t, of N particles uniformly distributed in a box of atmosphere with height h (m). We need to
know the rate of removal of particles:
Rate of removal of particles =

In other words, these small particles in the atmosphere don’t settle very quickly,
and an estimate of residence time in terms of months is appropriate.

The black smoke, or soot, we see emitted from diesel engines and smokestacks
consists mostly of solid particles made up of vast numbers of carbon atoms fused
together in benzene rings. Although these particles themselves can irritate lungs,
most often it is large organic molecules that stick to the surfaces of soot (adsorption)
that are responsible for the most serious health effects. Of greatest concern is a class
of benzene-like hydrocarbons called polynuclear (or polycyclic) aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons consist of fused benzene rings, the

simplest of which is napthalene, shown in Figure 8. PAHs are formed when carboncontaining materials are not completely oxidized during combustion. They are released as gases but quickly condense onto particles of soot. Common sources of
PAHs include tobacco smoke, motor vehicle exhaust, the char on charcoal-broiled
food, and smoke from wood and coal combustion. Probably the most dangerous of
these PAHs is a substance called benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), which consists of five fused
rings as shown in Figure 8c. BaP is a Category A human carcinogen known to cause
lung and kidney cancer.
Impacts of Particulates on the Human Respiratory System. The ability
of the human respiratory system to defend itself against particulate matter is, to a
large extent, determined by the size of the particles. To help understand these
defense mechanisms, consider the illustration in Figure 9. The upper respiratory system consists of the nasal cavity and the trachea, and the lower respiratory system
consists of the bronchial tubes and the lungs. Each bronchus divides over and over
again into smaller and smaller branches, terminating with a large number of tiny air
sacs called alveoli.
Large particles that enter the respiratory system can be trapped by the hairs
and lining of the nose. Once captured, they can be driven out by a cough or sneeze.
Smaller particles that make it into the tracheobronchial system can be captured by
mucus, worked back to the throat by tiny hairlike cilia, and removed by swallowing
or spitting. Particles larger than about 10 mm are effectively removed in the upper
respiratory system by these defense mechanisms. Smaller particles, however, are
often able to traverse the many turns and bends in the upper respiratory system
without being captured on the mucus lining. These particles may make it into the
lungs, but depending on their size, they may or may not be deposited there. Some
particles are so small that they tend to follow the air stream into the lungs and then
right back out again. Other submicron-size particles are deposited by Brownian
motion. Roughly between 0.5 mm and 10 mm, particles may be small enough to
reach the lung and large enough to be deposited there by sedimentation. Sedimentation in the lungs is most effective for particles between 2 mm and 4 mm.
Particulates aggravate existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease and
damage lung tissue, and some are carcinogenic. At concentrations near the pre-2006
national ambient standard, increases in the number of hospital visits for upper respiratory infections, cardiac disorders, bronchitis, asthma, pneumonia, and emphysema, and increased mortality rates have been observed. One study estimated

hospital admissions for congestive heart failure (an inability of the heart to pump
out all the blood that returns to it) increased 8 percent for each 100 mg/m3 increase
in PM10 (Raloff, 1995). Evidence that tens of thousands of premature deaths are
caused each year in the United States due to inhaled particular matter led the EPA to
reevaluate its short-term PM2.5 air quality standard in 2006. The new 24-hour standard reduction from 65 to 35 mg/m3 is expected to result in annual reductions of
2,500 to 5,700 premature deaths in people with lung or heart disease, 2,600 cases of
chronic bronchitis and 7,300 cases of acute bronchitis, 5,000 nonfatal heart attacks,
1,630 hospital admissions for cardiovascular or respiratory symptoms, 1,200 emergency room visits, and 350,000 days when people miss work or school. The EPA
estimates the monetary value of these benefits at between $17 billion and $35 billion (U.S. EPA, 2006b).

Air Pollution

Oxides of Sulfur
About 86 percent of the 15 million tons per year of anthropogenic sulfur oxide
emissions are the result of fossil fuel combustion in stationary sources, and most of
that is emitted by coal-fired power plants. Only about 5 percent comes from highway vehicles. The only significant noncombustion sources of sulfur emissions are
associated with petroleum refining, copper smelting, and cement manufacture.
All fossil fuels as they are extracted from the ground contain some sulfur.
Coal, which has the most, typically contains from 1 to 6 percent sulfur. About half
of that is organic sulfur that is chemically bound to the coal. The other half is simply physically trapped in the noncarbon portion of coal, and much of that half can
be removed by pulverizing and washing the coal before combustion. The amount of
sulfur in petroleum tends to be less than a few percent, and if refined, almost all of
that sulfur is removed during processing. Gasoline, for example, has much less than
1 ppm sulfur. Natural gas as it leaves the wellhead contains a considerable amount
of sulfur in the form of highly toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) that must be removed
before the gas can be used. After natural gas is cleaned, however, negligible amounts
of sulfur remain, which makes it a highly desirable replacement fuel for coal.
When these fuels are burned, the sulfur is released mostly as sulfur dioxide
(SO2) but also with small amounts of sulfur trioxide (SO3). Sulfur dioxide, once released, can convert to SO3 in a series of reactions, which, once again, involve a free
radical such as OH•:
SO2 + OH• : HOSO•2
HOSO•2

+ O2 : SO3 +

HO•2

(25)
(26)

The HO•2 radical can then react with NO to return the initial OH• as in (20). Sulfur
trioxide reacts very quickly with H2O to form sulfuric acid, which is the principal
cause of acid rain.
SO3 + H2O : H2SO4

(27)

Sulfuric acid molecules rapidly become particles by either condensing on existing
particles in the air or by merging with water vapor to form H2O ¬ H2SO4 droplets.
Often, a significant fraction of particulate matter in the atmosphere consists of such
sulfate (SO4) aerosols. Sulfate particles in urban air typically have an effective size of
less than 2 mm, with most of them being in the range of 0.2 to 0.9 mm. Their size is
comparable to the wavelengths of visible light, and their presence greatly affects
visibility. Their size also allows deep penetration into the respiratory system.
Acid Deposition. The transformation from SO2 gas to sulfate particles (SO4) is
gradual, taking a matter of days. During that time, sulfur pollution may be deposited back onto the land or into water, either in the form of SO2 or sulfate. In either
form, sulfur pollution can be deposited by removal during precipitation (wet deposition), or by slow, continuous removal processes that occur without precipitation
(dry deposition). Figure 10 suggests the effects of time and distance on the conversion and deposition of sulfur.
Figure 11 shows pH for wet deposition in the United States and Canada.
Natural rainfall would have a pH value between 5 and 5.6, and anything less is
loosely called “acid rain.” About two-thirds of U.S. coal consumption, the source of

most sulfur emissions, is east of the Mississippi, which correlates well with the acidity of rainfall in the eastern half of the country. Unfortunately, large areas of the
eastern United States and Canada with the worst acid rain have lakes that are inherently the most sensitive to acidification.
Projected reductions in power-plant sulfur emissions driven by the Acid Rain
Program (Title IV of the CAA) are projected to have significant impacts on the fraction of U.S. lakes suffering from chronic acidification. Figure 12 shows the results of
one study on the fraction of lakes that are projected to be acidified in 2030 with and
without Title IV.
Health and Welfare Impacts. Sulfur dioxide is highly water soluble, much
more so than any of the other criteria pollutants. As a result, when inhaled, it is
most likely to be absorbed in the moist passages of the upper respiratory tract, the
nose and upper airways, where it does less long-term damage. Other gases, being
less soluble, are more likely to reach the more critical terminal air sacs of the lungs.
When sulfur is entrained in an aerosol, however, the aerodynamic properties of the
particles themselves affect the area of deposition, and it is possible for sulfur oxides
to reach far deeper into the lungs. The combination of particulate matter and sulfur
oxides can then act synergistically, with the effects of both together being much
more detrimental than either of them separately. In fact, in every major air pollution
episode, the combination of sulfur oxides and particulates has been implicated as a
cause of the excess mortality observed.
Sulfur oxides can damage trees, especially when trees are bathed in acid fog or
clouds that tend to have very low pH levels. Acidification also damages plants by

396

Air Pollution

affecting their ability to extract nutrients from the soil. Nutrients are leached from
soils more readily under acidic conditions, and low pH levels allow aluminum to
solubilize, which interferes with the uptake of nutrients. Sulfurous pollutants can
discolor paint, corrode metals, and cause organic fibers to weaken. Airborne
sulfates significantly reduce visibility and discolor the atmosphere. Most of the visibility impairment in the eastern United States is caused by sulfates, whereas in the
western United States, it is more often nitrogen oxides and dust.
Prolonged exposure to sulfates causes serious damage to building marble,
limestone, and mortar, as the carbonates (e.g., limestone, CaCO3) in these materials
are replaced by sulfates. The reaction between limestone and sulfuric acid shows
such a replacement:
CaCO3 + H2SO4 : CaSO4 + CO2 + H2O

(28)

The calcium sulfate (gypsum, CaSO4) produced by this reaction is water soluble and
easily washes away, leaving a pitted, eroded surface. Many of the world’s historic
buildings and statues are rapidly being degraded due to this exposure. It is common
now in such monuments as the Acropolis in Greece, for the original outdoor statuary
to be moved into air-conditioned museums, leaving plaster replicas in their place.

Lead
Most lead emissions in the past were from motor vehicles burning gasoline containing the antiknock additive, tetraethyllead Pb(C2H5)4. The antiknock properties of
tetraethyllead were first discovered by Thomas Midgley and colleagues at the
General Motors Research Laboratory in 1921; by coincidence, in the same laboratory, Midgley also developed the first chlorofluorocarbons (Thomas, 1995). Both
discoveries were considered major advances at the time but later turned out to have
terrible human health and environmental consequences.
In the United States (and just a handful of other developed countries), almost all lead emissions from gasoline have been eliminated so that by 1993, per
capita emissions of lead in the United States were only 3 percent of the world
average (Thomas, 1995). The decrease in the United States was originally motivated by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 that dictated a 90 percent drop
in CO, NOx, and hydrocarbon emissions from automobiles. As will be described
later in this chapter, the auto industry chose to use catalytic converters as their
principal emission control system for those three pollutants. Catalytic converters,
it turns out, are quickly rendered ineffective when exposed to lead, so beginning
in the late 1970s, many cars were designed to only burn unleaded fuels. By the
mid 1990s, after virtually all cars in the United States had catalytic converters,
leaded gasoline was completely phased out. As a result, total U.S. lead emissions
decreased 93 percent between 1982 and 2002 with the major remaining sources
being industrial processes (particularly metal-processing plants) and leaded fuels
used for aviation and nonroad vehicles (Figure 13). Unfortunately, in most of the
rest of the world, leaded gasoline is still the predominant fuel and lead emissions
remain very high.
Lead is emitted into the atmosphere primarily in the form of inorganic particulates. Much of this is removed from the atmosphere by settling in the immediate

vicinity of the source. Airborne lead may affect human populations by direct inhalation, in which case people living nearest to major sources such as highways or metalsprocessing plants are at greatest risk. Despite the elimination of most lead emissions
from motor vehicles, the soil around highways is still heavily contaminated, and it
can become airborne when disturbed. It also can be tracked into homes where it may
end up embedded in carpeting ready to become airborne once again. Wiping your
feet on a doormat is one easy and effective way to help reduce that hazard.
Inhalation of lead can occur indoors as well as outdoors. A major indoor
source of lead is chipped and flaking particles of lead-based paints that were commonly used in the past. Paint containing Pb3(CO3)2(OH)2 was widely used in white
paint, and red paints with Pb3O4 are still used for outdoor protection of metal surfaces. Those substances are no longer allowed for paints used indoors, but they can
be used for exterior surfaces. When those paints chip, peel, or are sanded, lead particles become dusts that are easily ingested or inhaled. Chips of leaded paint are
somewhat sweet and are all too often eaten by children living in older homes.
Although most human exposure to lead is from inhalation, it can also be ingested after airborne lead is deposited onto soil, water, and food crops such as leafy
vegetables and fruits. It also can be ingested when water systems are contaminated.
Lead once was used to make water pipes and was used until recently in solder to join
copper water pipes, but those uses have been banned in new systems in the United
States. Lead can still leach out of those older water systems, especially if the water is
acidic or particularly soft. For such systems, running the water from a tap for a
minute before drinking it is highly recommended.
Lead poisoning can cause aggressive, hostile, and destructive behavioral
changes, as well as learning disabilities, seizures, severe and permanent brain damage, and even death. Measurements in actual communities suggest that an increase
in airborne lead concentration of 1 mg/m3 (the NAAQS is 1.5 mg/m3) results in an
increase of about 1 to 2 mg per deciliter (mg/dL) in human blood levels. Blood levels
of 10 to 15 mg/dL are associated with reduced intelligence and detrimental effects
on growth and development of children, leading the U.S. Public Health Service to
label lead as the greatest environmental health threat to our children (Thomas, 1995;

398

Air Pollution

U.S. PHS, 1991). As lead was phased out of gasoline in the United States, the average concentration of lead in blood dropped from 16 to 3 mg/dL, which makes it one
of the most successful of all environmental achievements.

Toxic Air Pollutants
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require the EPA to speed up efforts to control toxic air pollutants. As defined in the Act, these are pollutants that “are known
to be, or may reasonably be anticipated to be, carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic,
neurotoxic, which cause reproductive dysfunction, or which are acutely or chronically toxic.” There are literally hundreds of such chemicals, including 189 compounds that are listed in the 1990 Amendments. The EPA is charged with setting
emission standards that achieve “the maximum degree of reduction in emissions”
taking into account cost and other nonair-quality factors, and risk-based health
standards that will assure no more than a 1-in-a-million risk for the most exposed
individuals. In light of the years of effort that were needed to deal with the six criteria pollutants, the emission and air-quality standard setting that will be required for
hundreds of additional chemicals is daunting.
Even before the 1990 Amendments were passed, the EPA had initiated
National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) under
Section 112 of the Act, but by 1988, only asbestos, benzene, beryllium, coke-oven
emissions, inorganic arsenic, mercury, radionuclides, and vinyl chloride were regulated. Another important step in the regulation of air toxics was initiated by the
Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) and expanded by the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. Starting in 2000, the EPA began to
focus on persistent bioaccumulative toxic (PBT) chemicals, which are of concern
not only because they are toxic but also because their long life in the environment
allows them to build up, or accumulate, in body tissue. The PBT chemicals include,
for example, dioxin, lead, mercury, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and certain pesticides.
Manufacturing facilities that use any of the now 650-some listed chemicals
must submit annual reports to the EPA on their releases. These releases form a database called the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) that has been in operation since 1987.
The availability of the TRI to the public is intended to discourage use of these chemicals by manufacturers who want to avoid negative publicity. In 1993, reported air
emissions totaled 1.7 billion pounds of toxic chemicals; in 2004, that had dropped
only a few percent, down to 1.55 billion pounds.

Air Pollution in the World’s Megacities
The world’s population is becoming ever more urbanized, causing increasing environmental pressures, not the least of which is deterioration of air quality in many of
the most rapidly growing cities. In 1970, there were only four cities in the world
with populations over 10 million people (Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, and London);
by 1990, there were 12; and by 2000, there were 24 such cities. Fully half of the
world’s population now live in urban areas. The World Health Organization (WHO)

399

Air Pollution

and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) undertook a study of air
quality in 20 megacities (cities with more than 10 million people), with a focus on
the same six criteria pollutants that are regulated in the U.S. Clean Air Act except
that in most cities it is total Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) that is measured
instead of PM10. In many circumstances, the data being gathered are difficult to
obtain and of questionable quality, but a preliminary assessment is beginning to
emerge that shows increasing numbers of people exposed to increasingly unhealthy
concentrations of air contaminants, especially in developing countries.
In most megacities, the principal source of air pollution is motor vehicles. In
almost all cities in the developing world, leaded fuels are still being burned; a high
percentage of the vehicles are diesel-powered trucks and buses with no emission controls; many streets are unpaved; and traffic congestion, which intensifies emissions,
is overwhelming. The resulting concentrations of Pb, CO, NOx, O3, and TSP are
often many times higher than air-quality guidelines defined by WHO. In addition,
many countries have coal-fired power plants and other industrial facilities within
city limits, so levels of SOx, NOx, and particulates are correspondingly high.
Mexico City used to be ranked by WHO as the world’s most polluted city.
Ozone concentrations above 0.10 ppm occur as many as 300 days per year (the U.S.
8-hr standard is 0.09 ppm), and during a 5-day period in November, 1997, each
day’s readings rose above 0.25 ppm. But now, Mexico City has lost that dubious
distinction, with the 10 most polluted cities in the world now being in China.
A study of populations and air quality in 20 megacities showed that high levels of suspended particulate matter (SPM) is the most prevalent air-quality problem
(WHO/UNEP, 1992). Of these 20 cities, 12 have serious problems with particulate
matter, where “serious” is defined to mean WHO air-quality guidelines are exceeded
by more than a factor of two (see Figure 14). Beijing, Mexico City, and Seoul have
serious SPM combined with serious SOx problems, which is a lethal combination
that leads to increased mortality and morbidity. In a number of areas, including
parts of Beijing, Calcutta, Delhi, Shanghai, and Seoul, combustion of coal and biomass fuels for cooking and heating leads to extremely high pollutant concentrations
indoors where many people, women especially, spend most of their time. Indoor air
quality will be described later in this chapter.

Air Pollution

Motor Vehicle Emissions
The transportation sector in the United States accounts for a significant fraction of
all the criteria pollutants except for sulfur oxides. Most of those emissions are from
cars and trucks, which emit those pollutants right in the middle of crowded, urban
populations. In many of the developing countries of the world, the growth rate in
numbers of motor vehicles far outstrips the population growth rate, which is leading
to urban congestion and very unhealthy air quality. China provides a particularly
compelling example, with vehicle growth projected to rise from about 30 million in
2005 to over 180 million by 2030 (Figure 15). Vehicles are the principal cause of
China’s urban air pollution problems, which are estimated to be causing on the

(Energy Foundation, 2005). Moreover, China’s demand for imported oil for all of
those cars and trucks is projected to rise rapidly, with much of that expected to come
from the volatile Middle East. As Figure 15 shows, China’s Persian Gulf oil imports
will soon exceed those of the United States.

Emission Standards
The legislative history of auto emission controls began in California in 1959 with
the adoption of state standards to control exhaust hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon
monoxide (CO). It was supplemented in 1960 by standards to control emissions
resulting from crankcase blowby. These standards, however, were not fully implemented until they were deemed technologically feasible in 1966. Federal standards
for CO and HC began in 1968, and by 1970, the year in which the first major
amendments to the Clean Air Act were enacted, the auto industry had reduced
hydrocarbon emissions by almost three-fourths and carbon monoxide by about
two-thirds. At that time, no controls were required for NOx, and to some extent,
improvements in HC and CO emissions were made at the expense of increased
nitrogen oxide emissions.
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 required that emissions from automobiles be reduced by 90 percent compared to levels already achieved by the 1970

model year. These standards were to be reached by 1975 for CO and HC, and by
1976 for NOx, with a one-year delay allowed if the industry could adequately prove
that the technology was not available to meet them. The 1970 Amendments were
unusual in that they were “technology forcing,” that is, they mandated specific
emission levels before technology was available to meet the standards. The automobile industry successfully argued the case for the one-year delay, in spite of the fact
that the 1973 Honda, with a stratified charge engine, was able to meet the 1975
emission requirements while getting 40 mpg.
Subsequently, in response to the oil embargo of 1973 and concerns for the impact of emission standards on fuel economy, the Federal Energy Supply and
Coordination Act of 1974 rolled the standards back again to 1978–79. Finally, the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 delayed the standards once more, setting the
date for HC and CO compliance at 1981. At the same time, the 1977 Amendments
eased the standard for NOx from 0.4 g/mile to 1 g/mile, calling the 0.4 g/mile a
“research objective” despite the fact that California, which is allowed to set its own
auto emission standards as long as they are more stringent than federal requirements, stayed with the original 0.4 g/mile standard for NOx. The 1990 Amendments
to the Clean Air Act brought national standards to the level of California standards
beginning with the 1996 models, including the 0.4 g/mile NOx standard. Table 4
shows current (2006) Federal Motor Vehicle Emission Standards.
As usual, California leads the way in terms of emission reduction requirements. Table 4 shows California’s Air Resources Board (CARB) requirements for
cars (less than 3,750 lbs) to be designated as Low Emission Vehicles (LEVs), Ultra
Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs), and Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (SULEVs).
Heavier vehicles have similar, but less stringent, emission labeling requirements.
New vehicles sold in California must be at least LEVs. Compared to federal standards for each vehicle weight, an SULEV vehicle has emission reductions of 96 percent for HC, 70 percent for CO, and 95 percent for NOx. California also has an
Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emission Vehicle (AT-PZEV) designation for
vehicles that meet SULEV emission standards but in addition have zero evaporate
emissions and a 15-year/150,000-mile warranty. The fact that quite a number of

vehicles sold in California meet the AT-PZEV designation makes the current federal
standards look rather modest.
Table 4 indicates that vehicle emission regulations are expressed in terms of
grams of pollutant per mile of driving. Since emissions vary considerably as driving
conditions change, it has been necessary to carefully define a “standard” driving
cycle and to base emission regulations on that cycle. In 1996, the original Federal
Test Procedure (FTP) was augmented with a Supplemental Federal Test Procedure
(SFTP) designed to more accurately deal with more aggressive driving behavior
(higher speeds, rapid acceleration, rapid speed fluctuations), impacts of air conditioners, and emissions after the engine is turned off. The two new drive cycles
defined in the SFTP are shown in Figure 16.

CAFE Fuel Economy Standards
The oil embargo of 1973 shifted Congress’ attention from motor vehicle emissions
to motor vehicle fuel efficiency. At the time, cars in the United States averaged
about 14 miles per gallon (mpg). Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards were enacted in 1975, which required fuel efficiency for each manufacturer’s
fleet of new automobiles to average at least 27.5 mpg within a 10-year period. The
FTP drive cycles defined for emissions were used to determine city and highway
fuel efficiencies, which are then weighted 55 percent city and 45 percent highway
to determine an overall fuel efficiency. A separate fuel efficiency standard was
enacted to cover “light trucks.” That standard started at 20.2 mpg and has been
tightened to 22.2 mpg for model-year (MY) 2007 light trucks. Light trucks are
defined, in part, by whether there is additional cargo-carrying capacity above conventional passenger cars, which includes readily detachable rear seats, or additional road clearance (e.g., axle clearance above 18 cm). That means most SUVs
have been considered to be light trucks, subject to just the less-stringent mpg
standard.
Another perverse incentive for SUVs was part of the Energy Tax Act of 1978,
which established a gas-guzzler tax that applies only to passenger cars that get less
than 22.5 mpg. The tax can be sizable; for example, the gas-guzzler tax for passenger cars getting less than 12.5 mpg is about $7,700. Most SUVs, being categorized
as light trucks, are exempt from this tax.
The average CAFE fuel economy of new passenger cars sold in the United
States did rise to the required 27.5 mpg by 1986, but the increasing popularity of
SUVs and pick-up trucks, which now account for more than half of new vehicle
sales, has tipped the scales and overall light-duty vehicle efficiency has dropped from
its peak of 25.9 mpg in 1986–87 to 24 mpg in 2006. The American Council for an
Energy Efficient Economy estimates raising CAFE standards by 5 percent annually
until 2012 and by 3 percent per year thereafter could save 67 billion barrels of oil
over the next 40 years. This is 10 to 20 times greater than the potential oil supply
from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
As most drivers know, the sticker CAFE fuel efficiency rating on their cars
tends to overestimate actual mpg. A 2006 EPA report has generated more realistic fuel efficiency statistics that derate CAFE values by about 15 percent. They
also exclude credits for alternative-fuel capability, which has allowed manufacturers to claim 27.5 mpg for vehicles capable of running on E85 (85 percent ethanol,
15 percent gasoline) even though there have been very few gas stations that offer
this fuel. Using these more realistic estimates for “real world” fuel efficiency, the
average fuel economy for all model year 2006 light-duty vehicles is estimated to
be 21.0 mpg, the same value as achieved in 1994, but 5 percent lower than the
peak value achieved in 1987–88. Figure 17 shows this adjusted fuel economy history.
Criticism of the CAFE program for light trucks resulted in new definitions that
will apply on an optional basis to model year 2008–2010 light trucks and be required for model year 2011 vehicles. Under the new Reformed CAFE standards, the
definition will be based on a measure of vehicle size called “footprint,” which is a
vehicle’s wheelbase multiplied by its track width. Fuel economy standards will then
be based on that footprint, with an overall light truck target of 24.1 mpg.

EXAMPLE 5 Average Fuel Efficiency
Suppose a fuel efficiency test indicates a particular automobile gets 20 mpg in the
city and 29 mpg on the highway. What would its CAFE fuel efficiency be?
If new cars get an average of 27.5 mpg, and new light trucks get 22.2 mpg,
what would be the fleet average if 50 percent of sales are light trucks?
Solution The CAFE efficiency assumes 55 percent urban and 45 percent highway miles. If we want to imagine 1 mile of driving, the fuel efficiency would be
MPG =

1 mile
= 23.2 mpg
0.55 miles
0.45 miles

b

The fleet efficiency for 28 mpg cars and 22.2 mpg light trucks would be
MPG = 0.50 * 27.5 mpg + 0.50 * 22.2 mpg = 24.8 mpg

Fuel efficiency is important for a number of reasons, not the least of which are
national security issues related to our dependence on imported oil (approximately
equal to the energy demands of our highway vehicles). While emissions of the conventional pollutants CO, HC, and NOx are not necessarily directly related to fuel
efficiency, emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) certainly are.

The Conventional Otto Cycle Engine
The most common internal combustion engine is a four-stroke, spark-ignited, piston
engine invented around 1880 by a German engineer, Nicholas Otto. The operation
of an Otto cycle, or four-stroke, engine is described in Figure 18. On the first, or
intake stroke, the descending piston draws in a mixture of fuel and air through the
open intake valve. The compression stroke follows, in which the rising piston

compresses the air/fuel mixture in the cylinder against the now closed intake and
exhaust valves. As the piston approaches the top of the compression stroke, the
spark plug fires, igniting the mixture. In the power stroke, the burning mixture
expands and forces the piston down, which turns the crankshaft and delivers power
to the drive train. In the fourth, or exhaust stroke, the exhaust valve opens and the
rising piston forces combustion products out of the cylinder, through the exhaust
system, and into the air. Diesel engines operate with a similar cycle, but they compress the fuel more during the compression stroke, which makes the gases in the
cylinder so hot that they ignite of their own accord without needing a spark plug.

406

Air Pollution

The single most important factor in determining emissions from a four-stroke,
internal combustion engine is the ratio of air to fuel in the mixture as it enters the
cylinders during the intake stroke. To analyze that mixture ratio and its impact on
emissions, let us begin with the stoichiometry of gasoline combustion. While modern gasolines are blends of various hydrocarbons, an average formulation can be
represented as C7H13. We can write the following to represent its complete combustion in oxygen:
C7H13 + 10.25 O2 : 7 CO2 + 6.5 H2O

(29)

If we want to show complete combustion in air, we can modify this reaction to account
for the fact that about 3.76 moles of N2 accompany every mole of O2 in air. Thus,
10.25 * 3.76 = 38.54 mol of N2 can be placed on each side of the reaction, yielding
C7H13 + 10.25 O2 + 38.54 N2 : 7 CO2 + 6.5 H2O + 38.54 N2

(30)

where any oxidization of nitrogen to nitrogen oxides has been neglected.
EXAMPLE 6 Stoichiometric Air-Fuel Ratio
Determine air-to-fuel ratio required for complete combustion of gasoline.
Solution For each mole of gasoline, 10.25 moles of O2 and 38.54 moles of N2
are required. Using (30), we can determine the masses of each constituent as
1 mol C7H13 = 7 * 12 + 13 * 1 = 97 g
10.25 mol O2 = 10.25 * 2 * 16 = 328 g
38.54 mol N2 = 38.54 * 2 * 14 = 1,079 g
Considering air to be made up of only O2 and N2, the air-fuel ratio needed for
complete oxidation of gasoline is
(328 + 1,079) g
Air
=
= 14.5
Fuel
97 g
This is known as the stoichiometric ratio for gasoline.
If the actual air/fuel mixture has less air than the stoichiometric ratio indicates
is necessary for complete combustion, the mixture is said to be rich. If more air is
provided than is necessary, the mixture is lean. A rich mixture encourages production of CO and unburned HC since there is not enough oxygen for complete combustion. On the other hand, a lean mixture helps reduce CO and HC emissions
unless the mixture becomes so lean that misfiring occurs. Production of NOx is also
affected by the air/fuel ratio. For rich mixtures, the lack of oxygen lowers the combustion temperature, reducing NOx emissions. In the other direction, beyond a certain point, lean mixtures may have so much excess air that the dilution lowers flame
temperatures and also reduces NOx production.
Figure 19 shows the relationship among CO, HC, and NOx emissions, and the
air/fuel ratio. Also shown is an indication of how the air/fuel ratio affects both
power delivered and fuel economy. As can be seen, maximum power is obtained for
a slightly rich mixture, while maximum fuel economy occurs with slightly lean

mixtures. Before catalytic converters became the conventional method of emission
control, most cars were designed to run slightly rich for better power and smoothness. When the first automobile emission limitations were written into law in the
1960s, only CO and HC were controlled, so manufacturers simply redesigned their
engines to run on a less rich mixture. This simple change had the desired effect of
reducing CO and HC, but at the same time NOx emissions increased. Later, when
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 forced emission controls on all three pollutants, it was no longer possible to meet emission limitations by simply modifying the
air/fuel ratio, and automotive engineers turned to the three-way catalytic converter.
The air/fuel ratio is, of course, not the only factor that influences the quantity
of pollutants created during combustion. Other influencing factors include ignition
timing, compression ratio, combustion chamber geometry, and very importantly,
whether the vehicle is idling, accelerating, cruising, or decelerating. In addition, not
all of the pollutants created in the combustion chamber pass directly into the exhaust system. Some find their way around the piston during the power and compression strokes, into the crankcase. This blowby, as it is called, used to be vented
from the crankcase to the atmosphere, but now it is recycled back into the engine air
intake system to give it a second chance at being burned and released in the exhaust
stream. This control method is called positive crankcase ventilation (PCV), and the
main component is a crankcase ventilator valve that adjusts the rate of removal of
blowby gases to match the changing air intake requirements of the engine, making
sure that the desired air/fuel ratio is not upset by these added gases.

Two-Stroke Engines
Two-stroke (or “two-cycle”) engines are similar to conventional four-stroke engines
in that they use a spark to ignite an air/fuel mixture to deliver power to a piston connected to a crankshaft. The key difference is that every other stroke is a power
stroke rather than every fourth stroke as is the case with an Otto cycle engine. As
suggested in Figure 20, the intake and compression strokes are combined into one,
as are the power and exhaust strokes. On the upstroke, the piston compresses an air/
fuel mixture that is about to be ignited while it draws the next cycle’s fuel into the
crankcase. The fuel is fired by a spark plug, driving the piston down. On that downstroke, the air/fuel mixture in the crankcase is forced around the piston into the
combustion chamber, forcing the exhaust gases out the exhaust port. By doubling
the number of power strokes, the two-cycle engine has more power for its size than
a conventional four-stroke engine. It also is simpler because there are no moving
valves. The net is a smaller, lighter, less expensive engine that has been popular for
use in motorcycles, lawnmowers, and outboard motors.
The problem with two-strokes is that they emit much more pollution than
four-stroke engines. As exhaust gases are being pushed out of the combustion chamber, some of the fresh fuel entering the chamber is pushed out as well. Also, twostroke engines need oil to be mixed with the gasoline to lubricate moving parts in
the crankcase, which leads to oily, smelly exhaust fumes as well as engine misfiring.
While these engines constitute only a small fraction of the internal combustion
engines in use, their emissions are disproportionately large. It has been estimated,
for example, that a two-stroke outboard motor emits as much pollution in an hour
as driving a late-model automobile 800 miles. In 1996, the EPA announced new
rules that will virtually eliminate conventional two-stroke outboard motors.

Diesel Engines
At this time, the only real competition to the basic spark-ignition, internal combustion engine for motor vehicles is the diesel. Diesel engines have no carburetor since
fuel is injected directly into the cylinder, and there is no conventional ignition system
with plugs, points, and condenser since the fuel ignites spontaneously during the
compression stroke. Diesels have much higher compression ratios than conventional

409

Air Pollution

(Otto cycle) engines, and since they do not depend on spark ignition, they can run
on very lean mixtures. Thus, they are inherently more fuel efficient. The increased
fuel efficiency of diesels was responsible for their momentary surge in popularity just
after the oil crises of the 1970s. They continue, however, to be popular in Europe.
Since diesels run with very lean mixtures, emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are inherently very low. However, because high compression ratios
create high temperatures, NOx emissions can be relatively high. Moreover, since the
fuel is burned with so much excess oxygen, conventional catalysts that require a
lack of oxygen to chemically reduce NOx are ineffective, and less efficient controls
are used. In addition, diesels emit significant quantities of carbonaceous soot particles, and diesel engine exhaust has been labeled a probable human carcinogen containing over 40 cancer-related substances. Health risks from diesel exhaust are
severe. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) estimates that 70 percent of the
airborne cancer risk in the state is attributable to diesel particulate matter, and
the combination of NOx and PM is responsible each year for an estimated 2,900
premature deaths, 3,600 hospital admissions, 240,000 asthma attacks and respiratory symptoms, and 600,000 lost workdays. Advancing the technology needed for
cleaner burning diesel engines has become a major public health priority.
The historic tradeoff for diesels—high torque and excellent fuel efficiency
versus excessive NOx and PM emissions as well as noise—have led to their on-again,
off-again popularity. In Europe, where gasoline costs twice as much as in the United
States, diesels outsell conventional spark-ignition vehicles. New emission controls
announced in 2006 by several manufacturers suggest they may be on the verge of
another comeback.

Automobile Emission Controls
Vehicular emissions are caused by both combustion and evaporation. During the
exhaust stroke of an internal combustion engine, combustion gases are pushed
through the exhaust manifold and out the tailpipe. In this exhaust system, most of
the control of automobile emissions now occurs. In addition, fuel evaporation from
the gas tank itself, from the engine while it is running, and during refueling at the gas
station, all contribute significant amounts of hydrocarbon vapors to the atmosphere.
Exhaust emission controls have evolved considerably. An early approach to
CO and HC control involved air injection into an enlarged exhaust manifold to encourage continued oxidation after these gases left the combustion chamber. Some
degree of NOx control was achieved by recirculating a portion of the exhaust gas
back into the incoming air/fuel mixture. This relatively inert gas that is added to the
incoming mixture absorbs some of the heat generated during combustion without
affecting the air/fuel ratio. The heat absorbed by the recirculated exhaust gas helps
reduce the combustion temperature and, hence, helps decrease the production of
NOx. Air injection as a method of control is no longer used, and exhaust gas recirculation is becoming less common.
The approach most favored by automobile manufacturers to achieve the emission standards dictated by the Clean Air Act has been the three-way catalytic
converter (“three-way” just means it handles all three pollutants, CO, HC, and
NOx). A three-way converter is able to oxidize hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide
to carbon dioxide, while reducing NOx to N2 all in the same catalyst bed. These
catalytic converters are very effective in controlling emissions, and they have the

410

Air Pollution

advantage of allowing the engine to operate at near stoichiometric conditions where
engine performance and efficiency are greatest. In fact, they must operate within
a very narrow band of air/fuel ratios near the stoichiometric point or else their ability to reduce all three pollutants at once is severely compromised, as shown in
Figure 21a. Maintaining that degree of control has required the development of

precise electronic feedback control systems that monitor the composition of exhaust
gas and feed that information to a microprocessor-controlled carburetor or fuelinjection system as shown in Figure 21b. Often it is a malfunction in this sophisticated control system that turns on your dashboard “engine” light.
Catalysts are quickly destroyed if leaded fuels are burned, resulting in no pollution control at all. In fact, it was the development of catalytic converters that led
to the virtual elimination of tetraethyllead as an octane booster in gasoline. The
enormous human health benefits resulting from reduced lead emissions are directly
attributable to the development of catalytic converters. Lead, as well as other substances, including sulfur, zinc, manganese, silicone, and phosphorus, are said to
“poison” the catalyst, rendering them ineffective by coating the surface of the catalyst, which keeps the exhaust gases from making contact.
Three-way converters are very effective once they are warmed up, but when
they are cold, as well as when there are spurts of sudden acceleration or deceleration, they can release excessive amounts of pollution that may offset much of their
perceived benefits. Those shortcomings are being addressed, and low-emission vehicles now usually have a separate early catalytic converter in the system to reduce
startup emissions by burning off the hydrocarbons from the extra-rich mixture used
in a cold engine. Another problem with catalytic converters is their rate of emission
of nitrous oxide (N2O, also known as laughing gas), which is relatively harmless in
terms of human health, but is a potent greenhouse gas.
The particulate (soot) emissions coupled with the inherently high rate of NOx
production in diesel engines make control of their tailpipe emissions more difficult
than is the case for conventional spark-ignition engines. A two-way oxidation catalyst is commonly used to oxidize CO and HC to CO2 and H2O. These catalysts also
help reduce soot, but since diesel fuel is burned with so much excess oxygen (very
lean), conventional catalysts that require a lack of oxygen to control NOx are ineffective. Control technologies include NOx adsorbers, selective catalytic reduction
(SCR), and diesel particulate filters (DPFs). DPFs are problematic since they can clog
and lose their effectiveness over time.
A promising new approach to diesel engine design is called the homogeneouscharge compression-ignition (HCCI) engine. By carefully controlling the concentration and temperature of fuel and air, the entire mixture begins to burn simultaneously
during compression. HCCI engines provide more complete combustion at lower temperatures, which greatly reduces the formation of NOx, and thereby increases the
likelihood that tailpipe emission controls can achieve U.S. standards.

Cleaner Gasoline
Motor vehicle hydrocarbon emissions are not only the result of inefficient combustion; they are also caused by vaporization of the fuel itself. Vaporization rates are
very dependent on temperature, so evaporation is especially high just after the
engine is turned off, when the fans, cooling systems, and airflow due to vehicle
movement are no longer operative. To help control these evaporative emissions,
automobiles are equipped with vapor-recovery systems, but these are not totally
effective. A complementary approach is to reduce the volatility of the gasoline itself,
but there are tradeoffs. In cold, winter conditions, vehicles are harder to start unless
fuels vaporize readily at low temperatures, but in the summer, that higher volatility

412

Air Pollution

would lead to excessive evaporative emissions. Refineries then must formulate their
fuels differently depending on location and season.
Gasoline can also be reformulated to help reduce tailpipe emissions of CO and
HC by adding oxygenates that encourage more complete combustion. The Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990 have since 1992 required 2 percent oxygen (by
weight) in fuels used in areas that have high levels of CO pollution. The additives
most often used to create these “oxygenated” fuels have been ethanol (C2H5OH)
and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE).

Ethanol

Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE)

MTBE has been the preferred oxygenate because it has a higher octane number and
is not as volatile as ethanol. On the other hand, MTBE is water soluble and does not
biodegrade easily. Unfortunately, leaking underground fuel tanks, as well as fuel
spills, have allowed MTBE to contaminate groundwaters and reservoirs, creating a
potential drinking water hazard. Studies with rats and mice suggest drinking MTBE
may cause gastrointestinal irritation, liver and kidney damage, and nervous system
effects. There is some evidence that inhalation while pumping gasoline can cause
nausea, dizziness, mental confusion, and headaches. The full health effect impacts of
MTBE have not yet been fully assessed. As a result of these concerns, the EPA has
been wrestling with banning MTBE and perhaps removing the 2 percent oxygen requirement in reformulated gasoline that motivated its use in the first place.
California banned use of MTBE as of 2003.
Another controversy over the formulation of gasoline has to do with the
octane enhancers that have replaced tetraethyllead. Until recently, the antiknock
properties of tetraethyllead have been achieved in the United States by increasing the
proportion in gasoline of certain benzene derivatives such as toluene, C6H5CH3,
and xylene, C6H4(CH3)2. Along with benzene, these are collectively known as BTX
(benzene, toluene, xylene). BTX boosts the octane rating of gasoline, but BTX
hydrocarbons are more reactive than normal constituents of gasoline, so they can
increase formation of photochemical smog.

There is another octane enhancer, methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl,
better known as MMT, which was used in the United States until 1977 when health
concerns led to its withdrawal. Combustion products of MMT contain toxic manganese, and the EPA opposed its use until health risks could be evaluated. The manufacturer of MMT argued that it had been used for many years in Canada without
apparent health effects, and in 1995, a Federal appeals court ruled in their favor and
use of MMT began again in the United States in 1996.

Alternative Fuels
A number of alternatives to gasoline are being investigated as possible fuels for the
future. These include ethanol, methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane,
hydrogen, and electricity. The motivation for developing vehicles capable of running
on these fuels is a combination of the potential to reduce air pollution and, perhaps
more importantly, to reduce our demand for petroleum and the negative environmental, nonrenewable resource depletion, and national security issues associated
with its use.
The Alternative Motor Fuel Act of 1988 (AMFA). One of the incentives
provided by Congress in AMFA is a provision that allows manufacturers to earn
“credits” toward meeting their fleet CAFE obligations whenever they sell a vehicle
that has the capability of running on an alternative fuel—whether or not that vehicle ever does so. Several million flexible-fuel (FFV), or dual-fuel, vehicles are on the
road today because of that provision.
The CAFE fuel-efficiency of a flex-fuel vehicle is based on a weighted average
of the fuel efficiency while running on gasoline (or diesel) and the efficiency while
running on the alternative fuel. To provide the motivation for flex-fuel vehicles, the
mpg calculation allows 1 gallon of alternative fuel to be counted as being equivalent
to 0.15 gallons of gasoline. It also assumes 50 percent of the miles driven are powered by the alternative fuel, whether or not such a fuel is ever used (U.S. DOT,
2002). Example 6 shows an example calculation.
EXAMPLE 6 CAFE Fuel Efficiency for a Flex-Fuel Vehicle
A flex-fuel vehicle gets 24 mpg while running on gasoline and 16 mpg while running on pure ethanol (the energy density of ethanol is only about two-thirds that
of gasoline). Find its CAFE fuel efficiency rating.
Solution Using the standard calculation method with 50 percent of the miles
on gasoline and 50 percent on ethanol, with 1 gallon of ethanol counted as
0.15 gallons of gasoline, gives
CAFE mpg =

1 mile
= 39.2 mpg

So, the manufacturer gets to sell a 24 mpg (gasoline) car and count it as a
39.2 mpg vehicle in their fleet of vehicles sold that year, even if the buyer never
uses ethanol fuel.

414

Air Pollution

While the flex-fuel CAFE credits have resulted in slightly lower average fuel
economy for fleets of vehicles certified as meeting the 27.5 mpg standard, the credits do help break the “chicken and egg” problem of which comes first: cars that can
run on alternative fuels, or gas stations that will provide those fuels.
Ethanol. Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), also known as grain alcohol, has long been
used as an oxygenate to reduce CO emissions, in which case the gasoline/ethanol
mixture is usually referred to as gasohol. But it is now being much more widely discussed as a potential fuel to help reduce our dependence on imported oil.
Ethanol can be blended with gasoline with a range of mixture ratios. The two
mixtures common in the United States are E10 (10 percent ethanol, 90 percent gasoline, by volume) and E85 (85 percent ethanol, 15 percent gasoline). Motivated by
AMFA, several million flex-fuel vehicles capable of running on any range of mixtures from pure gasoline all the way to E85, have been part of the U.S. motor vehicle fleet for many years. In fact, Henry Ford’s original Model T’s and later Model A’s
were flex fuel vehicles capable of running on ethanol or gasoline.
The main modifications required to make a gasoline vehicle into an ethanol
flex-fuel vehicle include a sensor that detects the type of fuel being pumped to the
engine, higher flow-rate fuel injectors needed to accommodate the lower energy density of ethanol relative to gasoline, and electronic and software modifications to ensure proper operation of the fuel injection system. In addition, certain modifications
to the materials used in fuel lines, fuel tanks, and fuel pumps are needed. These
modifications are so inexpensive that manufacturers, motivated in part by the CAFE
benefits, often offer their flex-fuel vehicles at no extra cost.
Most owners of these flex-fuel vehicles have no idea that they are ethanol
capable, and even if they did, there are so few gas stations that offer E85 that most
have never tried to use it. To help inform buyers, it has been suggested that flex-fuel
vehicles be equipped with some distinguishing feature, such as a yellow gas cap
(symbolizing the color of corn, from which most U.S. ethanol is made). There will
be certain differences for drivers using E85. For example, the energy density of
E85 is 29 percent less than that of gasoline (Table 5), which suggests E85 would
need to sell for 29 percent less per gallon to be equivalent in energy content. For example, if gasoline costs $3.00 per gallon, E85 would need to cost no more than
0.71 * $3.00 or $2.13 to be cost effective. The vehicle’s driving range on a tank of
E85 would be similarly decreased.

Air Pollution

In Brazil, large amounts of ethanol are fermented from sugarcane, which supplies roughly 40 percent of its nondiesel vehicle fuel. In fact, all gasoline sold in
Brazil now must have at least 20–25 percent ethanol. In the United States, about
90 percent of ethanol comes from corn, but it is also produced using a petroleumbased feedstock, ethylene. While corn and sugarcane have been the traditional
sources of ethanol, there is considerable excitement these days for the potential to
derive ethanol from cellulosic (woody) materials ranging from agricultural waste to
fast-growing perennial grasses such as switchgrass and miscanthus. Cellulosic
ethanol wouldn’t necessarily compete with food crops for agricultural land and its
energy balance ratio (energy derived divided by energy needed in production) would
be much higher than that for corn or sugarcane.
In terms of CO2 emissions, there has been some controversy over whether or
not corn-based ethanol is better than gasoline. Burning biomass fuels has the inherent advantage that the carbon released to the atmosphere is equivalent to the carbon
that was removed during photosynthesis. That simple balance is somewhat offset,
however, by fossil fuels needed to power the farm equipment, manufacture the
chemicals and fertilizers, process and transport the biomass fuel, and so forth.
Similarly, the drilling, pumping, refining, and transporting required to deliver gasoline to your tank also involves a carbon investment that must be accounted for when
comparing gasoline to ethanol. With careful accounting, greenhouse gas emissions
of corn-based ethanol are similar to gasoline, sugarcane is a better source, and cellulosic ethanol promises to be far better than either corn or sugarcane (Farrell et al.,
2006). All three are much less petroleum intensive than gasoline, which is a national
security benefit.
While there are clear carbon advantages to ethanol, those may be offset by the
potential for ethanol to make conventional air pollution worse. A recent study
(Jacobson, 2007) concludes vehicles fueled by E85 would have significantly higher
emissions of organic gases, especially formaldehyde (HCHO) and acetaldehyde
(CH3CHO), which could lead to an increase in ozone-related mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency-room visits, especially in sunny, smoggy areas like Los Angeles.
Methanol. Methanol (CH3OH), also known as wood alcohol, has long been the
fuel of choice in high-performance racing cars. It has a much higher octane rating
than gasoline, which enables engines to be designed with higher compression ratios
for increased power. It burns with a lower flame temperature than does either gasoline or diesel fuel, so NOx emissions are reduced. It burns more completely, as well,
so that HC and CO emissions are also reduced.
Methanol is not without its problems. Its emissions are much higher in
formaldehyde (HCHO), an eye irritant and a suspected carcinogen. The low volatility of pure methanol makes it difficult to start engines in cold conditions, and it is
highly toxic. It burns without a visible flame, which can lead to especially dangerous
conditions in an accident involving fire. Moreover, its energy content is only about
half that of gasoline, so either much larger fuel tanks would be required or the driving range would be considerably reduced.
Some of the problems of pure methanol can be overcome by using a blend of
methanol and gasoline. A mixture of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline
(M85) eliminates the cold start problem and yields a visible flame as well. It also
tastes much worse than pure methanol, which should discourage ingestion. The

416

Air Pollution

blend has an octane rating of 102 (versus 87–92 for gasoline) and a volumetric
energy content of a little more than half that of gasoline. While the increase in combustion efficiency does slightly offset the lower energy density, the driving range for
M85 is still only about 60 percent of that for gasoline. Eventually, if methanol
becomes widely available, it would be possible to take advantage of the increased
octane level with more efficient engines dedicated to M85 use.
With regard to emissions of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, methanol
derived from natural gas produces slightly less CO2 than gasoline. On the other hand,
if methanol is produced from coal, total CO2 emissions released during coal processing and methanol combustion could be double that of gasoline (Moyer, 1989).
Biodiesel. Biodiesel can be created from vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled
restaurant greases. It is a biodegradable, domestic, renewable energy fuel that has
the potential to help reduce the need for petroleum-based transportation fuels as
well as helping farmers by providing a market for excess soybean oil. As a renewable fuel whose production requires little or no fossil fuel, its net CO2 emissions are
only about one-fourth that of standard diesel (U.S. DOE, 2006). The oxygen in
biodiesel enables more complete combustion to take place, and the lower sulfur content reduces sulfate emissions. In fact, biodiesel meets the EPA 2006 regulations for
ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. Compared with conventional diesel, biodiesel substantially reduces emissions of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, sulfates,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. NOx emissions, however,
are increased.
Biodiesel can be blended with conventional diesel in any mixture strength, with
the most common blend B2 (2 percent biodiesel, 98 percent standard diesel) being
popular because of its superior lubricity compared to new ultra-low-sulfur diesel
fuels. Other common blends include B5 and B20. Conventional diesel engines can
run on B20 without any modifications, but higher concentrations may require certain
engine modifications to avoid maintenance or operational problems. A fleet of recycling and garbage trucks in San Jose, CA, are currently running on B100. Biodiesel
has a high Cetane number (good for cold-start fuel ignition) and superior lubricity,
which can help extend engine life. The energy density of B100 (118,170 Btu/gal) is
slightly lower than diesel No. 2 (typically around 129,000 Btu/gal), but in the low
concentrations normally used, that decrease should be unnoticeable. Some reports
that biodiesel may cause problems with certain types of elastomeric materials have
been reported. B100, and similarly high concentrations, may be inappropriate for
cold climates due to potential gelling of the fuel. Winterization packages, such as fuel
heaters, can mitigate this problem, however, as was demonstrated by a successful test
of B100 used in vehicles in Yellowstone National Park.
Biodiesel is produced using a process called transesterification in which the unwanted glycerin in vegetable oil or fat is removed by chemical reactions involving an
alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol, and a catalyst. The catalyst is usually sodium
or potassium hydroxide. The biodiesel end product consists of long chain methyl
esters. Though some have tried it, running straight vegetable oil or recycled grease in
diesel engines can cause multiple engine problems and should be avoided.
Biodiesel can also be used for nontransportation applications, such as boilers
or home heating oil systems. In these applications, sulfur emissions can be dramatically reduced since home heating oil tends to have high sulfur content, and biodiesel

417

Air Pollution

has almost none. B20, for example, can reduce sulfur emissions by almost 20 percent. NOx emissions are reduced by roughly the same fraction (U.S. DOE, 2006).
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). This is already used in fleets of trucks, delivery vans, and buses, especially in Canada and New Zealand. CNG is a very clean
fuel, and very low emissions of reactive hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, particulates, and toxics are possible. NOx emissions can be higher than gasoline-fueled
vehicles, but only because earlier NOx emission-control systems were not as well
developed as those designed for gasoline. Heavy fuel tanks are required to contain
the highly pressurized gas, and at 3,600 pounds per square inch of pressure, it takes
three times as much volume to store an equivalent amount of energy compared with
gasoline. Methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, so
leakage could make methane worse for global warming than gasoline. CNG vehicles
qualify for the alternative-fuels CAFE benefits. For example, a vehicle that gets
25 miles per 100 ft3 of (STP) natural gas has a CAFE rating of over 200 mpg (see
Problem 17).
To counter the problem of finding a CNG fueling station, one manufacturer has
introduced a home refueling appliance called Phill (Figure 22). The wall-mounted
unit has a small compressor that can deliver up to 3,600 psi of natural gas, which allows a CNG vehicle to refuel overnight directly from a home natural gas supply line.
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). LPG (propane) is another fuel that has been
used for vehicle fleets such as school buses, trucks, fork lifts, taxis, and farm vehicles.
Some vehicles have been designed with dual tanks so that either gasoline or LPG can
be burned, but the added flexibility of fuel sources is offset somewhat by the added

space, weight, and complication of such systems. Compared with gasoline, carbon
monoxide emissions are somewhat lower; hydrocarbon emissions are roughly the
same but are less reactive; NOx emissions tend to be higher but could be lower if
appropriate control systems are developed; and carbon dioxide may be lower or
higher depending on whether the LPG is derived from natural gas or petroleum.

Electric-Drive Vehicles
Some of the most promising ways to reduce motor vehicle air pollution are based on
augmenting, or even replacing, internal-combustion engines with electric motors.
By now, everyone is familiar with Hybrid-Electric Vehicles (HEVs), which were
described in the previous edition of this book as “A Car for the Future.” Well, the
future arrived very quickly and HEVs are now quite common. A new generation of
HEVs called Plug-in Hybrid-Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are now being introduced,
and in 2006, Tesla Motors introduced an all-electric roadster with phenomenal performance characteristics, which has reinvigorated electric vehicle (EV) enthusiasts.
Finally, some are optimistic about hydrogen-powered, fuel-cell vehicles as the car of
the future.
Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). HEVs have both an internal combustion
engine (ICE) and an onboard electric power system made up of a generator, electric
motor, and battery storage. Two approaches to the system design are used. In a
serial design, the ICE sends all of its power directly to a generator. The generator
then either charges the batteries or powers an electric motor that drives the wheels.
The engine never directly powers the car. In the more popular parallel design, the
ICE and the electric motor can both supply power to the wheels, switching back and
forth as driving conditions vary.
Figure 23 shows one version of a parallel HEV system under varying operating
conditions. Notice the dual function of the motor/generator. When electric power is
put into a motor/generator, it acts as an electric motor delivering mechanical shaft
power; when shaft power is put in, it acts as a generator delivering electricity. For
very slow-speed driving, the car can run entirely on its batteries. When cruising
along, the ICE and motor/generator (acting as an electric motor) provide power,
with perhaps some shaft power driving a small additional generator to recharge the
batteries. When bursts of power are needed, the battery pack is used to provide additional power to the electric motor. An added advantage of electric drive is the ability to do regenerative braking; that is, when coasting or when the brakes are applied
the electric motor becomes an electric generator that recharges the batteries with the
energy that would normally be dissipated by brake pads. Thus, the energy storage
device is charged partly from the onboard electric power system and partly from regenerative braking.
Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). The traction batteries in a conventional HEV have two purposes. They provide energy for acceleration, and they provide a place to store energy captured during slowing or braking. As such, they act
primarily as an energy buffer, not as a source of energy to power the vehicle very far,
or very fast, on electricity alone. A PHEV, on the other hand, is an HEV with
enough extra battery capacity added to allow the car to be driven a considerable

distance on battery power alone. The intention would be to charge those batteries,
most likely at night and at home, by plugging the car into the utility grid, so that the
next day, the first 30 or so miles would be powered by the batteries, and after that,
the car would operate as a conventional HEV running on gasoline. With typical
driving patterns, probably half or more of the miles driven would be on electricity
instead of gasoline, which could easily result in PHEVs that could travel over
100 miles per gallon of gasoline (plus the electrical input).
To the extent that PHEVs operate as electric vehicles, there would be virtually
no tailpipe emissions, so pollution would shift from the city where vehicles and people are concentrated, to the countryside where power plants tend to be located. Not
only would the location of emissions shift, but the type of emissions would change
as well. If the power plants burn fossil fuels, then HC and CO emissions would be
reduced, NOx could still be a problem, and particulate and SOx emissions could
greatly increase. Photochemical smog problems in the city would be eased, but acid
rain and other industrial smog problems could be exacerbated. Of course, to the
extent that electric power production might shift from fossil fuels, especially coal, to
renewable energy sources or nuclear power, there would be an obvious air quality
advantage even in the countryside. The additional benefit of driving cars on domestic fuels rather than imported oil is also very important (oil is used to generate less
than 2 percent of U.S. electricity).
Assuming PHEVs are charged at night, when roughly half of the nation’s generators are idle (and power is cheap), with proper planning and incentives, a sizeable
fleet could operate without building new power plants. In fact, the only additional
infrastructure needed for a PHEV is an extension cord. Figure 24 shows one scenario that indicates roughly 40 percent of the vehicle-miles in California could be
electric-drive vehicles supplied by plants currently idle at night.

As the following example illustrates, the “fuel” cost for electricity in an efficient PHEV is roughly one-fourth that of gasoline. The current hesitation to embrace
PHEVs is based on a concern for the additional cost of batteries and their likely
longevity. Assuming these will be overcome, PHEVs could well be the quickest and
easiest way to ease our dependence on foreign oil and reduce urban air pollution.
EXAMPLE 7 Cost of Electricity for a PHEV
Suppose a PHEV gets 45 mpg while running on gasoline that costs $3.00/gallon. If
it takes 0.25 kWh to drive 1 mile on electricity, compare the cost of fuel for gasoline and electricity. Assume electricity is purchased at an off-peak rate of 6¢/kWh.

On a per-mile basis, the cost of gasoline is
Gasoline =

$3.00/gal

= 6.67¢/mile

The cost to run on electricity is
Electricity = 0.25 kWh/mi * 6¢/kWh = 1.5¢/mile
Electric Vehicles (EVs). The old image of electric vehicles with golf-cart performance was shattered in 2006 when a small start-up company called Tesla Motors
introduced an all-electric roadster with a 250-mile range that accelerates from 0 to
60 mph in about 4 seconds. Compared to a PHEV, or even a conventional ICE, an EV
is especially simple since the drive-power system consists almost entirely of just a
motor/generator, battery bank, transmission, and power electronics. The extra weight
of the batteries is somewhat offset by weight reductions gained by having such a simple
drive system. The 90 percent efficient, 185-kW (250 hp) motor/generator in the Tesla,

for example, is much smaller, more efficient, and lighter than a conventional highperformance ICE (it weighs only about 70 pounds and is the size of a big watermelon).
Electric vehicles have inherent performance benefits as well as reduced emissions, when compared to conventional ICEs. The torque curve for electric motors is
quite different from that of ICEs (see Figure 25), and it is the shaft-twisting footpounds of torque that determines the ability of a car to accelerate quickly. Electric
motors have their highest torque at zero rpm, and it remains high throughout most
of their motor-speed curves. That means they can accelerate quickly, especially from
a standing start. ICEs, on the other hand, have very little torque at low rpm, and
for peak performance, their rpm has to be maintained within a very narrow range,
which translates to frequent gear changes to maintain optimum torque.
Fuel-Cell Vehicles (FCVs). In the eyes of some, the ideal future vehicle would be
one that converts hydrogen and oxygen in a fuel cell to produce electricity, which
could then power an electric-drive system. The only emissions from the vehicle itself
would be pure water. A number of different fuel cell technologies for both electric
vehicles and stationary applications have been under development for a number of
years. The technology most appropriate for vehicles is called a proton-exchangemembrane (PEM) cell (sometimes called a polymer-electrolyte membrane fuel cell).
As shown in Figure 26, a PEM cell consists of two porous gas diffusion electrodes separated by a thin membrane that allows positive hydrogen ions to pass
through it, while blocking electrons or neutral gases. The catalyst encourages the
entering hydrogen gas to dissociate into protons and electrons. The protons pass
through the electrolyte and the electrons flow through the external circuit delivering
electrical power to the load. The hydrogen ions and electrons recombine in the
cathode, forming water. Each cell produces only about 1>2 volt, so many cells are
connected in series to form a fuel cell stack with sufficient voltage to charge batteries or power the electric motor in the vehicle.
The source of hydrogen for a fuel cell can be any of a number of hydrocarbon
fuels, including natural gas, and even gasoline, or it may be hydrogen gas obtained
by electrolysis of water. In the usual circumstance, natural gas would be stripped of
its hydrogen using steam and a catalyst in a fuel reformer. The remaining CO2 is

released into the atmosphere, so there are greenhouse gas emissions. The second
approach, electrolysis, involves passing an electric current through water to break
apart the H2O molecules, releasing H2 and O2 gases. Essentially no greenhouse gas
emissions would be produced if the electricity for electrolysis comes from a solar,
wind, or nuclear source. The overall efficiency from electricity to hydrogen and back
to electricity generated by the fuel cell is very low, however. As Figure 27 illustrates,
that conversion is only about one-third as efficient as simply charging and discharging batteries in an EV.
Hydrogen can be pressurized and stored as a compressed gas, but even at
8,000 psi, it would take nearly five times the volume to store the same energy as gasoline. At least one manufacturer is trying to develop a -253°C, liquefied hydrogen

423

Air Pollution

storage system. Even as a liquid, the energy density of hydrogen is still only about
one-fourth that of gasoline. Hydrogen can also be stored in the form of metalhydrides in which hydrogen gas is absorbed into the crystalline structure of a metal
such as titanium or magnesium. Metal-hydrides have been used to store hydrogen for
use in experimental fuel-cell-powered buses, but weight and volume issues are still
significant. To store the same energy in metal hydrides as a 15-gallon, 150-pound
gasoline tank would require a 45-gallon tank weighing approximately 600 pounds.
Fuel-cell cars have numerous hurdles to overcome before they can be considered a viable technology. Besides the technical problems of complexity, weight,
range, and acceleration for the vehicle itself, there are questions to be resolved about
where the hydrogen will come from in the first place, as well as how it will be transported and distributed to fueling stations. The “chicken-and-egg” problem of which
comes first, fuel-cell-powered cars or hydrogen fueling stations, is problematic.
Well-to-Wheels Greenhouse Gas Emissions. A “well-to-wheels” analysis of
CO2 emissions starts at the source of fuel and ends with power delivered to the
wheels. For a conventional gasoline-powered car, the analysis is reasonably straightforward. It starts with an estimate of the efficiency with which petroleum in the
ground is extracted, processed into gasoline, and transported to the local gas station
(around 82 percent). Combining that with an assumption that all of the carbon in
gasoline is released as CO2, along with a miles-per-gallon estimate, leads to emissions per mile. For PHEVs, EVs, and FCVs, we need to estimate CO2 emissions
per kWh of electricity, which depends on the mix of fuels and efficiencies for the
source of that power. And we need an estimate of miles per kWh. For PHEVs, which
burn gasoline and run on electricity, we need to assume some ratio of miles driven
on each energy source. In other words, any comparison between vehicle types is very
dependent on the assumptions made.
Figure 28 shows a well-to-wheels analysis in which carbon from electricity is
the average from the U.S. grid (including 96 percent-efficient transmission). For the
PHEV, half of the miles driven are powered by electricity at 0.25 kWh/mile, and half
are powered by gasoline at 45 mpg (a little lower than the 50 mpg HEV to account
for the extra weight of batteries). Other assumptions and key data are shown in the
figure. Compared to the 50 mpg HEV, the PHEV has 9 percent lower carbon, and
the EV is 29 percent lower. It is interesting to note that the fuel-cell vehicle is
responsible for 8 percent more carbon than a conventional 50-mpg car and 52 percent more than the battery-electric vehicle.
The carbon emissions associated with electricity for the PHEV and EV in
Figure 28 are assumed to come from the average U.S. grid. The overall efficiency of
that power is less than one-third, and more than half of that is generated with highcarbon-intensity, coal-fired power plants. If we imagine the power coming from the
newest and best 60 percent-efficient, natural-gas-fired, combined-cycle (NGCC)
plants, and with a 96 percent-efficient grid delivery system, the carbon emissions for
the EV drop to about 76 gCO2/mile, which is one-third that of a 50-mpg HEV (see
Problem 23).
There is another possibility for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants from our automobile fleet. Both PHEVs and EVs could get their
electricity indirectly from the sun using grid-connected photovoltaics (PVs). Under a
scheme called net metering, the owner of a PV array can sell electricity to the grid
whenever more power is being produced than is needed, and buy it back again at

any time. Figure 29 illustrates the concept. As Example 8 suggests, a PV array
roughly the size of the roof of a single-car garage could generate enough electricity
to drive an efficient PHEV or EV over 10,000 miles per year on pollution-free solar
electricity. The economics are interesting as well. As Example 7 demonstrated, electricity used to displace gasoline is worth about $0.25/kWh, which is roughly the
current cost of PV electricity without any subsidies.

EXAMPLE 8 Driving on Sunlight
In “full sun” (defined as 1 kW/m2 of solar radiation), a 15 percent-efficient PV
array can deliver 0.15 kW/m2 of DC power under standard test conditions. After
accounting for dirt, temperature effects, and conversion from DC to AC, about
75 percent of that will be delivered to the grid. For a location with an annual
average insolation (solar radiation) equivalent of 5 hours/day of full sun, how
many kWh per day could be generated? If an EV or PHEV requires 0.25 kWh of
power from the grid to travel 1 mile, how many miles could be driven on the electricity delivered by a 15 m2 (161 ft2) PV array?
Solution

The average daily energy delivered by the PV array would be

PV daily energy = 15 m2 * 0.150 kW/m2 * 0.75 * 5 hr/day
= 8.44 kWh/day
At 0.25 kWh/mile, the vehicle could be driven
Annual miles =

Stationary Sources
Nontransportation fossil-fuel combustion is responsible for 90 percent of the SOx
and almost half of the NOx and PM10 emitted in the United States. Most of that
is released at electric power plants, and most of the power plant emissions result
from the combustion of coal. Both the regulatory and technological approaches to
reducing those emissions are very different from what we just described for motor
vehicles. Although most stationary source emissions are caused by combustion of
fossil fuels, other processes such as evaporation of volatile organic substances,
grinding, and forest fires, can be important as well. Our focus, however, will be on
combustion.
Since most air pollutants are produced during combustion, one of the most important, but most overlooked, approaches to reducing emissions is simply to reduce
the consumption of fossil fuels. There are three broad approaches that can be taken
to reduce fossil fuel consumption: (1) increase the conversion efficiency from fuel to
energy, (2) increase the efficiency with which energy is used, and (3) substitute other,
less polluting, energy sources for fossil fuels. Progress has been made on all three
fronts. The conversion efficiency from fuel to electricity for power plants has improved eight-fold from the 5 percent efficiency of Edison’s original plants a century
ago to nearly 40 percent for a modern coal-fired power plant, and almost 60 percent
for a new natural-gas-fired, combined-cycle (NGCC) power plant. Encouraging
gains have been made in improving the energy efficiency of end uses, and some estimates suggest that improvements in electric motors and motor controls, better lighting systems, more efficient manufacturing processes, and so forth can cut the per
capita electricity demands in half. The third approach is to reduce our reliance on

426

Air Pollution

fossil fuels by increasing power production from solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and nuclear sources.
To the extent that fossil fuels continue to be used, there are three general
approaches that can be used to reduce emissions:
1. Precombustion controls reduce the emission potential of the fuel itself. Examples include switching to fuels with less sulfur or nitrogen content in power
plants. In some cases, fossil-fuels can be physically or chemically treated to
remove some of the sulfur or nitrogen before combustion.
2. Combustion controls reduce emissions by improving the combustion process
itself. Examples include new burners in power plants that reduce NOx emissions, and new fluidized bed boilers that reduce both NOx and SOx.
3. Postcombustion controls capture emissions after they have been formed but
before they are released to the air. On power plants, these may be combinations of particulate collection devices and flue-gas desulfurization techniques, used after combustion but before the exhaust stack.

Coal-Fired Power Plants
Coal-fired power plants generate over half of U.S. electricity. They do so at the lowest cost of any power source (though wind is quickly closing that gap). Moreover,
the United States has a rather abundant coal resource base to supply those power
plants for decades into the future. Those benefits are somewhat offset by the environmental harm caused by coal. Not only are coal plants responsible for emitting
great quantities of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulates, they also emit
twice as much CO2 per kWh generated than new natural-gas-fired plants. Most
early emission controls for coal were designed to reduce particulates using postcombustion equipment such as baghouses and electrostatic precipitators. More recently,
especially as a result of increased awareness of the seriousness of acid rain and the
conversion of gaseous SOx and NOx into sulfate and nitrate particles, attention has
shifted somewhat toward redesigned combustors for NOx reductions and scrubbers
for SOx control.
Before going into any of the details on these and other emission control techniques, it is useful to introduce a typical conventional coal-fired power plant, as shown
in Figure 30. In this plant, coal that has been crushed in a pulverizer is burned to make
steam in a boiler for the turbine-generator system. The steam is then condensed, in this
case using a cooling tower to dissipate waste heat to the atmosphere, and the condensate is then pumped back into the boiler. The flue gas from the boiler is sent to an electrostatic precipitator, which adds a charge to the particulates in the gas stream so that
they can be attracted to electrodes that collect them. Next, a wet scrubber sprays a limestone slurry over the flue gas, precipitating the sulfur and removing it in a sludge of calcium sulfite or calcium sulfate, which then must be treated and disposed of.
All of those emission controls shown in Figure 30 are costly and now account
for close to 40 percent of the construction cost of a new coal-fired power plant. Not
only have emission controls been costly in monetary terms, they also use up about 5
percent of the power generated by the plant, reducing the plant’s overall efficiency.

Precombustion Controls
One of the two precombustion control techniques used on coal-fired power plants
to control sulfur emissions is fuel-switching. As the name suggests, it involves either
substituting low sulfur coal for fuel with higher sulfur content or, perhaps, blending
the two. Fuel switching can reduce SO2 emissions by anywhere from 30 to 90 percent, depending on the sulfur content of the fuel currently being burned. Often, fuel
switching can be a temporary measure taken only during periods of time when
atmospheric conditions are particularly adverse.
The sulfur content of coal is sometimes expressed as a percent, or, quite often,
in terms of mass of SO2 emissions per unit of heat energy delivered. Power plant coal
typically has sulfur content between 0.2 to 5.5 percent (by weight), corresponding to
an uncontrolled SO2 emission rate of about 0.4 to 10 lb/MBtu (0.17 to 4.3 g/MJ).
New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for coal plants restrict emissions to no
more than 1.2 lb/MBtu (0.5 g/MJ). Coal that can meet the NSPS without controls is
sometimes referred to as “compliance” coal, or more loosely, as “low sulfur” coal.
In round numbers, just under half of U.S. coal reserves are in the eastern half of
the United States (principally Illinois, West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and
Ohio), and just over half are in the western United States (Montana, Wyoming,
Colorado, and Texas). While that distribution is nearly even, the location of low
sulfur coal reserves is very unevenly divided. Almost all of our low sulfur coal, about
85 percent, is located in the western states (the only notable exceptions are small
reserves in West Virginia and Kentucky). But two-thirds of our coal consumption and

428

Air Pollution

three-fourths of coal production occurs east of the Mississippi. Increasing reliance on
fuel switching, then, would greatly increase the cost to transport the coal from mine
to power plant. It would also significantly affect the economies of a number of states
if eastern mines decrease production while western ones increase theirs. In addition,
western coal often has different ash, moisture, and energy content, which may require modifications to existing power plants to allow fuel switching. Such costs,
however, are relatively minor compared to the increased cost of low sulfur fuel.
The other precombustion approach currently used to reduce sulfur emissions
is coal cleaning. Sulfur in coal is either bound into organic coal molecules themselves, in which case precleaning would require chemical or biological treatment (at
the research stage now), or it can be in the form of inorganic pyrite (FeS2), which
can readily be separated using physical treatment. Pyrite has a specific gravity that is
3.6 times greater than coal, and that difference allows various coal “washing” steps
to separate the two. Such physical cleaning not only reduces the sulfur content of
coal, but it also reduces the ash content, increases the energy per unit weight of fuel
(which reduces coal transportation and pulverization costs), and creates more uniform coal characteristics that can increase boiler efficiency. These benefits can offset
much of the cost of coal cleaning. It has been estimated that this fairly simple coal
cleaning can reduce sulfur emissions by about 10 percent.

Fluidized-Bed Combustion (FBC)
Fluidized-bed combustion (FBC) is one of the most promising clean coal technologies. In an FBC boiler, crushed coal mixed with limestone is held in suspension
(fluidized) by fast-rising air injected from the bottom of the bed. Sulfur oxides
formed during combustion react with the limestone (CaCO3) to form solid calcium
sulfate (CaSO4), which falls to the bottom of the furnace and is removed. Sulfur
removal rates can be higher than 90 percent.
In an FBC boiler, the hot, fluidized particles are in direct contact with the boiler
tubes. This enables much of the heat to be transferred to the boiler tubes by conduction, which is much more efficient than convection and radiation heat transfer occurring in conventional boilers. The increase in heat transfer efficiency enables the boilers
to operate at around 800°C, which is about half the temperature of conventional boilers and is well below the 1,400°C threshold at which thermal NOx is formed. In addition to efficient SOx and NOx control, FBC boilers are less sensitive to variations in
coal quality. Coal with higher ash content can be burned without fouling heat exchange surfaces since the lower combustion temperature is below the melting point of
ash. In fact, fluidized bed combustors can efficiently burn almost any solid fuel,
including municipal waste, cow manure, and agricultural wastes such as tree bark.
Utility-scale FBC applications are just beginning, the first unit having gone
into operation in 1986. Even though the technology is still being modified and
improved, the fuel flexibility advantages and the inherent control of emissions have
enabled FBC to cross the commercial threshold, and in 2005, most boiler manufacturers offered them as a standard package.

Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle
Another promising technology, called integrated gasification combined cycle
(IGCC), offers the combination of increased combustion efficiency with reduced

global warming impacts.

emissions (Figure 31). In the first stage of an IGCC, a coal-water slurry is brought
into contact with steam to form a fuel gas, or syngas, consisting mostly of carbon
monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2):
C + H2O : CO + H2

(31)

The syngas is cleaned up, removing most of the particulates, mercury, and sulfur,
and then burned in a high-efficiency gas turbine that spins a generator. The air separation unit provides N2 to cool the gas turbine and O2 to increase syngas combustion efficiency. Waste heat from the gas turbine runs a conventional steam cycle,
generating more electricity. Despite energy losses in the gasification process, the
combination of gas turbine and steam turbine offsets those losses, and the overall
efficiency of fuel to electricity can approach 45 percent. This is considerably higher
than the best pulverized coal plants, which are usually less than 40 percent.
IGCC plants are more expensive than pulverized coal, and they have trouble
competing economically with natural-gas-fired combined cycle plants. As of 2006,
there were only four such plants in the world.

IGCC with Carbon Sequestration
Most of the interest in IGCC is based on the potential to control carbon emissions
from coal-fired power plants. By first converting coal to a syngas, it is possible to
design the gas cleaning stage in such a way that the carbon can be extracted before
combustion. By doing so, it may be possible to build “clean coal” power plants that
would be able to take advantage of the relative abundance of coal without contributing so much to global warming.
The key, of course, is finding a way to store all of that carbon, essentially forever. One of the more promising approaches is permanent CO2 storage in geologic
formations such as deep brine aquifers. Such formations consist of highly porous

430

Air Pollution

rock, similar to those containing oil and gas, but without the hydrocarbons that
produced our fossil fuels. Instead, they are filled with water containing high concentrations of salts dissolved out of the surrounding rocks. When these formations are
capped with impermeable rock, they might be viable for CO2 sequestration for the
indefinite future.

Controlling NOx Emissions
Recall that nitrogen oxides are formed partly by the oxidation of nitrogen in the fuel
itself (fuel NOx) and partly by the oxidation of nitrogen in the combustion air
(thermal NOx). Coal-fired power plants, which are responsible for about one-fourth
of total NOx emissions in the United States, emit roughly twice as much fuel NOx as
thermal NOx. Modifications to the combustion processes described next are designed
to reduce both sources of NOx. In one technique called low excess air, the amount of
air made available for combustion is carefully controlled at the minimum amount
required for complete combustion. Low excess air technology can be retrofitted onto
some boilers at a modest cost, yielding from 15 to 50 percent lower NOx emissions.
There is a new, second-generation low NOx burner technology that promises
even greater NOx removal efficiencies, and it can be retrofitted onto more existing
furnaces. Low NOx burners employ a staged combustion process that delays mixing
the fuel and air in the boiler. In the first stage of combustion, the fuel starts burning
in an air-starved environment, causing the fuel-bound nitrogen to be released as
nitrogen gas, N2, rather than NOx. The following stage introduces more air to allow
complete combustion of the fuel to take place. Potential NOx reductions of 45 to
60 percent seem likely. Another combustion modification incorporates a staged
burner for NOx control combined with limestone injection for SO2 control. This
limestone injection multistage burner (LIMB) technology is still under development
but looks promising.
While improved fuel-combustion technologies are now the primary method of
controlling emissions, new postcombustion controls may augment or replace lowNOx burners. One such technology, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), is already
widely used in Europe and Japan but has only recently been applied to high-sulfurcontent U.S. coal. With the SCR process, ammonia (NH3) is injected into boiler flue
gas, and the mix is passed through a catalyst bed in which the NOx and NH3 react
to form nitrogen and water vapor. The primary reactions are
4 NO + 4 NH3 + O2 : 4 N2 + 6 H2O

(32)

2 NO2 + 4 NH3 + O2 : 3 N2 + 6 H2O

(33)

It has been estimated that SCR for 90 percent NOx removal could add $66/kW
(1996 dollars) to the capital cost of a 250-MW coal-fired power plant, which translates to a 30-year, levelized extra cost of about 0.3¢/kWh (U.S. DOE and Southern
Company, 1997).

Flue Gas Desulfurization (Scrubbers)
Flue-gas desulfurization (FSD) technologies can be categorized as being either wet or
dry depending on the phase in which the main reactions occur, and either throwaway or regenerative, depending on whether or not the sulfur from the flue gas is

431

Air Pollution

discarded or recovered in a usable form. Most scrubbers operating in the United
States use wet, throwaway processes.
In most wet scrubbers, finely pulverized limestone (CaCO3) is mixed with water
to create a slurry that is sprayed into the flue gases. The flue gas SO2 is absorbed by
the slurry, producing a calcium sulfite (CaSO3) or a calcium sulfate (CaSO4) precipitate. The precipitate is removed from the scrubber as a sludge. Though the chemical
reactions between SO2 and limestone involve a number of steps, an overall relationship resulting in the production of inert calcium sulfite dihydrate is
CaCO3 + SO2 + 2 H2O : CaSO3 # 2 H2O + CO2

(34)

About 90 percent of the SO2 can be captured from the flue gas using limestone in
wet scrubbers.
Wet scrubbers sometimes use lime (CaO) instead of limestone in the slurry,
and the following overall reaction applies:
CaO + SO2 + 2 H2O : CaSO3 # 2 H2O

(35)

Lime slurries can achieve greater SO2 removal efficiencies, up to 95 percent.
However, lime is more expensive than limestone, so it is not widely used. Dry scrubbers must use lime, and that increased cost is one reason for their relative lack
of use.
Although wet scrubbers can capture very high fractions of flue gas SO2, they
have been accepted by the utilities with some reluctance. They are expensive, costing on the order of $200 million for a large power plant. If they are installed on
older plants, with less remaining lifetime, their capital costs must be amortized
over a shorter period of time, and annual revenue requirements increase accordingly. Scrubbers also reduce the net energy delivered to the transmission lines. The
energy to run scrubber pumps, fans, and flue gas reheat systems requires close to
5 percent of the total power produced by the plant. Scrubbers are also subject to
corrosion, scaling, and plugging problems, which may reduce overall power plant
reliability.
Scrubbers also use large amounts of water and create similarly large volumes
of sludge that has the consistency of toothpaste. A large, 1,000-MW plant burning
3-percent sulfur coal can produces enough sludge each year to cover a square mile of
land to a depth of over one foot (Shepard, 1988). Sludge treatment often involves
oxidation of calcium sulfite to calcium sulfate, which precipitates easier thickening
and vacuum filtration. Calcium sulfate (gypsum) can be reused in the construction
industry.

Particulate Control
A number of gas-cleaning devices can be used to remove particulates. The most
appropriate device for a given source will depend on such factors as particle size,
concentration, corrosivity, toxicity, volumetric flow rate, required collection efficiency, allowable pressure drops, and costs.
Cyclone Collectors. For relatively large particles, the most commonly used
control device is the centrifugal, or cyclone, collector. As shown in Figure 32,

particle-laden gas enters tangentially near the top of the cyclone. As the gas spins in
the cylindrical shell, centrifugal forces cause the particles to collide with the outer
walls, and then gravity causes them to slide down into a hopper at the bottom. The
spiraling gases then exit the collector from the top. Efficiencies of cyclones can be
above 90 percent for particles larger than 5 mm, but that efficiency drops off rapidly
for the small particle sizes that are of greatest concern for human health. While they
are not efficient enough to meet emission standards, they are relatively inexpensive
and maintenance free, which makes them ideal as precleaners for more expensive and
critical final control devices, such as baghouses and electrostatic precipitators.
Electrostatic Precipitators. To collect really small particles, most utility power
plants use electrostatic precipitators. Figure 33 shows one configuration for an
electrostatic precipitator consisting of vertical wires placed between parallel collector plates. The plates are grounded, and the wires are charged up to a very high
(negative) voltage of perhaps 100,000 V. The intense electric field created near the
wires causes a corona discharge, ionizing gas molecules in the air stream. The negative ions and free electrons thus created move toward the grounded plates, and

Air Pollution

along the way, some attach themselves to passing particulate matter. The particles
now carry a charge, which causes them to move under the influence of the electric
field to a grounded collecting surface. They are removed from the collection
electrode either by gravitational forces, by rapping, or by flushing the collecting
plate with liquids. Actual electrostatic precipitators, such as the one shown in
Figure 34, may have hundreds of parallel plates, with total collection areas
measured in the tens of thousands of square meters.
Electrostatic precipitators can easily remove more than 98 percent of the
particles passing through them, including particles of submicron size. Some have
efficiencies even greater than 99.9 percent. They can handle large flue-gas flow rates
with little pressure drop, and they have relatively low operation and maintenance
costs. They are quite versatile, operating on both solid and liquid particles. Precipitators are very efficient, but they are expensive and take a lot of space. Area requirements increases nonlinearly with collection efficiency, in accordance with the
following relationship, known as the Deutsch-Anderson equation:
h = 1 - e - wA>Q

(36)

where h is the fractional collection efficiency, A is the total area of collection plates,
Q is the volumetric flow rate of gas through the precipitator, and w is a parameter
known as the effective drift velocity. The effective drift velocity is the terminal speed
at which particles approach the collection plate under the influence of the electric
field. It is determined from either pilot studies or previous experience with similar
units. Any consistent set of units can be used for these quantities.
EXAMPLE 9 Electrostatic Precipitator Area
An electrostatic precipitator with 6,000 m2 of collector plate area is 97 percent
efficient in treating 200 m3/s of flue gas from a 200-MW power plant. How large
would the plate area have to be to increase the efficiency to 98 percent and to
99 percent?
Solution

Rearranging (36) to solve for the drift velocity, w, gives
w = -

That is about the area of two football fields! As these calculations suggest, the
additional collector area required to achieve incremental improvements in
collection efficiency goes up rapidly. To increase from 97 to 98 percent required
690 m2 of added area, whereas the next 1 percent increment requires 1,190 m2.

435

Air Pollution

Baghouses. The major competition that electrostatic precipitators have for efficient collection of small particles is fabric filtration. Dust-bearing gases are passed
through fabric filter bags, which are suspended upside-down in a large chamber,
called a baghouse, as shown in Figure 35. A baghouse may contain thousands of
bags, which are often distributed among several compartments. This allows individual compartments to be cleaned while others remain in operation.
Part of the filtration is accomplished by the fabric itself, but a more significant
part of the filtration is caused by the dust that accumulates on the inside of the bags.
Efficiencies approach 100 percent removal of particles as small as 1 mm; substantial
quantities of particles as small as 0.01 mm are also removed. They have certain disadvantages, however. As is the case for precipitators, baghouses are large and expensive.
They can be harmed by corrosive chemicals in the flue gases, and they cannot operate
in moist environments. There is also some potential for fires or explosions if the dust
is combustible. The popularity of baghouse filters is rising, however, and they now
rival precipitators in total industrial sales.

Combined Heat and Power Systems
The traditional approach to controlling emissions from stationary sources has been
focused on technologies applied to conventional, large, centralized power stations.
For these plants, only about one-third of the input energy ends up as electricity,
which is then shipped to customers who may be located hundreds of miles away.
The other two-thirds of the input energy ends up as low temperature waste heat that
can’t very easily be delivered to customers who, not surprisingly, don’t want to live
very close to one of these giant power plants. If, instead, power plants were smaller
and cleaner, customers could imagine having them located on their side of the electric meter, in which case the waste heat might be captured and used for space heating, space cooling, and/or process heat for industrial processes. Less fuel would need
to be burned, which could translate into lower emissions.
A number of technologies can be used for these combined heat-and-power
(CHP) systems, including fuel cells, microturbines, Stirling engines, and new, highefficiency reciprocating engines. For a number of reasons, fuel cells are the most
interesting. They are quiet, emit almost no pollution, are modular so they can be
small enough to power a laptop computer or large enough to provide utility-scale
power, and have the potential to be more efficient than electricity generated by
burning fuels. Given these benign characteristics, fuel cells can be sited in locations
where no conventional power plant would be allowed, in which case the waste heat
from the fuel cell can often be used for on-site needs. By doing on-site cogeneration
of heat and electricity, the overall efficiency of fuel cells can climb toward 80 or
85 percent.
Figure 36 shows the three key processes in a complete fuel-cell system, including a reformer that strips hydrogen from natural gas, the fuel-cell stack itself, and a
power conditioner to convert the fuel cell’s DC power into AC. For hightemperature fuel cells, such as solid-oxide (SOFC) and perhaps molten-carbonate
cells (MCFC), the reforming can be done internally without a separate fuel processor. Solid polymer PEM cells have electrical efficiencies around 35 to 40 percent,
whereas SOFC and MCFC systems can exceed 50 percent electrical efficiency.
To get a sense of the efficiency improvements that CHP systems offer,
Figure 37 shows an example in which a unit with 35 percent electrical efficiency and

Air Pollution and Meteorology
Obviously, air quality at a given site can vary tremendously from day to day even
though emissions may remain relatively constant. The determining factors have to
do with the weather: how strong are the winds, in what direction are they blowing,
what is the temperature profile, how much sunlight is available, and how long has it
been since the last strong winds or precipitation were able to clear the air? Air quality is dependent on the dynamics of the atmosphere, the study of which is called
meteorology.

Adiabatic Lapse Rate
The ease with which pollutants can disperse vertically into the atmosphere is largely
determined by the rate of change of air temperature with altitude. For some temperature profiles, the air is stable, that is, air at a given altitude has physical forces
acting on it that make it want to remain at that elevation. Stable air discourages
the dispersion and dilution of pollutants. For other temperature profiles, the air is
unstable. In this case, rapid vertical mixing takes place that encourages pollutant
dispersal and increases air quality. Obviously, vertical stability of the atmosphere is
an important factor that helps determine the ability of the atmosphere to dilute
emissions; hence, it is crucial to air quality.
Let us investigate the relationship between atmospheric stability and temperature. It is useful to imagine a “parcel” of air being made up of a number of air
molecules with an imaginary boundary around them. If this parcel of air moves

438

Air Pollution

upward in the atmosphere, it will experience less pressure, causing it to expand and
cool. On the other hand, if it moves downward, more pressure will compress the air,
and its temperature will increase. This heating or cooling of a gas as it is compressed
or expanded should be a familiar concept. Pumping up a bicycle tire, for example,
warms the valve on the tire; releasing the contents of a pressurized spray can allows
the contents to expand and cool, cooling your finger on the button as well.
As a starting point, we need a relationship for the rate of change of temperature
of a parcel of air as it moves up or down in the atmosphere. As it moves, we can imagine its temperature, pressure, and volume changing, and we might imagine its surroundings adding or subtracting energy from the parcel. If we make small changes in
these quantities, and apply both the ideal gas law and the first law of thermodynamics,
it is relatively straightforward to derive the following expression (see Problem 28):
dQ = Cp dT - V dP

(37)

where
dQ = heat added to the parcel per unit mass (J/kg)
Cp = specific heat of air at constant pressure; that is, the amount of heat
required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of air by 1°C while holding its
pressure constant (= 1,005 J/kg-K)
dT = incremental temperature change (K)
V = volume per unit mass (m3/kg)
dP = incremental pressure change in the parcel (Pa)
Let us make the quite accurate assumption that as the parcel moves, there is no
heat transferred across its boundary; that is, this process is adiabatic. This means
that dQ = 0, so we can rearrange (37) as
V
dT
=
dP
Cp

(38)

Equation (38) gives us an indication of how atmospheric temperature would change
with air pressure, but what we are really interested in is how it changes with altitude. To do that, we need to know how pressure and altitude are related.
Consider a static column of air with cross-section A, as shown in Figure 38. A
horizontal slice of air in that column of thickness dz and density r will have mass

rA dz. If the pressure at the top of the slice due to the weight of air above it is
P(z + dz), then the pressure at the bottom of the slice, P(z), will be P(z + dz) plus
the added weight per unit area of the slice itself:
P(z) = P(z + dz) +

(39)

where g is the gravitational constant. We can write the incremental pressure, dP, for
an incremental change in elevation, dz, as:
dP = P(z + dz) - P(z) = -gr dz

Expressing the rate of change in temperature with altitude as a product and substituting in (38) and (40) gives

However, since V is volume per unit mass, and r is mass per unit volume, the product Vr = 1, and (41) simplifies to

The negative sign indicates that temperature decreases with increasing altitude.

This is a very important result. When its sign is changed to keep things simple,

(44)

Equation 44 tells us that moving a parcel of dry air up or down will cause its
temperature to change by 9.76°C/km, or roughly 10°C/km. This temperature profile
will be used as a reference against which actual ambient air temperature gradients
will be compared. As we shall see, if the actual air temperature decreases faster with
increasing elevation than the adiabatic lapse rate, the air will be unstable and rapid
mixing and dilution of pollutants will occur. Conversely, if the actual air temperature drops more slowly than the adiabatic lapse rate, the air will be stable and air
pollutants will concentrate.
Equation (44) was derived assuming our parcel of air could be treated as an
ideal gas that could be moved about in the atmosphere without any heat transfer between it and its surroundings. Both assumptions are very good. It was also assumed
that the air was dry, but this may or may not be such a good assumption. If air has
some water vapor in it, Cp changes slightly from the value assumed but not enough
to warrant a correction. On the other hand, if enough water vapor is present that
condensation occurs when the parcel is raised and cooled, latent heat will be
released. The added heat means a saturated air parcel will not cool as rapidly as a
dry one. Unlike the dry adiabatic rate, the saturated adiabatic lapse rate (≠s) is not

a constant since the amount of moisture that air can hold before condensation begins is a function of temperature. A reasonable average value of the moist adiabatic
lapse rate in the troposphere is about 6°C/km. Figure 39 shows the dry and saturated adiabatic rates.
EXAMPLE 10 Air Conditioning for a High-Altitude Aircraft?
An aircraft flying at an altitude of 9 km (30,000 ft) draws in fresh air at - 40°C
for cabin ventilation. If that fresh air is compressed to the pressure at sea level,
would the air need to be heated or cooled to be delivered to the cabin at 20°C?
Solution As the air is compressed, it warms up. As it warms up, it is even easier for the air to hold whatever moisture it may have had, so there is no condensation to worry about, and the dry adiabatic lapse rate can be used. At 10°C per
km, compression will raise the air temperature by 10 * 9 = 90°C, making it
-40 + 90°C = 50°C (122°F). It needs to be air conditioned!

Atmospheric Stability
Our interest in lapse rates is based on the need to understand atmospheric stability
since it is such a crucial factor in the atmosphere’s ability to dilute pollution. There
are a number of factors, such as windspeeds, sunlight, and geographical features,
that cause the actual ambient lapse rate (≠) in the real atmosphere to differ from the
1°C/100 m dry adiabatic lapse rate just calculated. Differences between the ambient
lapse rate and the adiabatic lapse rate determine the stability of the atmosphere.
Consider a parcel of air at some given altitude. It has the same temperature and
pressure as the air surrounding it. Our test for atmospheric stability will be based on
the following mental experiment. If we imagine raising the parcel of air slightly, it will
experience less atmospheric pressure, so it will expand. Because it will have done

441

Air Pollution

work on its environment (by expanding), the internal energy in the parcel will be
reduced, so its temperature will drop. Assuming the parcel is raised fast enough to be
able to ignore any heat transfer between the surrounding air and the parcel, the cooling will follow the adiabatic lapse rate. After raising the parcel, note its temperature,
and compare it with the temperature of the surrounding air. If the parcel, at this higher
elevation, is now colder than its surroundings, it will be denser than the surrounding
air and will want to sink back down again. That is, whatever it was that caused the
parcel to start to move upward will immediately be opposed by conditions that make
the parcel want to go back down again. The atmosphere is said to be stable.
If, however, raising the parcel causes its temperature to be greater than the surrounding air, it will be less dense than the surrounding air and will experience buoyancy forces that will encourage it to keep moving upward. The original motion
upward will be reinforced, and the parcel will continue to climb. This is an unstable
atmosphere.
Consider Figure 40a, which shows an ambient temperature profile for air that
cools more rapidly with altitude than the dry adiabatic lapse rate. In this case, the
ambient air temperature is said to be superadiabatic. Imagine a 20°C parcel of air at
1 km to be just like the air surrounding it. If that parcel is raised to 2 km, it will cool
adiabatically to 10°C. The 10°C parcel of air at 2 km is now warmer than the surrounding air (0°C in the figure), so it is less dense, more buoyant, and wants to keep
rising (“warm air rises”). In other words, shoving the parcel of air up some in a superadiabatic atmosphere creates forces that want to keep it moving upward.
Conversely, a parcel of air at 1 km that is nudged downward becomes colder than
the surrounding air, and so it keeps sinking. It doesn’t matter whether the parcel of
air is nudged up or down; in either case, it keeps on going, and the atmosphere is
said to be unstable.

so it sinks back down (stable).

442

Air Pollution

In Figure 40b, the ambient temperature profile is drawn for the subadiabatic
case in which the ambient temperature cools less rapidly than the adiabatic lapse
rate. If we once again imagine a parcel of air at 1 km and 20°C that is, for one reason
or another, nudged upward, it will find itself colder than the surrounding air. At its
new elevation, it experiences the same pressure as the air around it, but it is colder, so
it will be denser and will sink back down. Conversely, a parcel starting at 1 km and
20°C that starts moving downward will get warmer, and less dense than its surroundings, so buoyancy forces will push it back up again. In other words, anything
that starts a parcel of air moving up or down will cause the parcel to experience
forces that will want it to return to its original altitude. The subadiabatic atmospheric profile is therefore stable.
If the ambient lapse rate is equal to the adiabatic lapse rate, moving the parcel
upward or downward results in its temperature changing by the same amount as its
surroundings. In any new position, it experiences no forces that either make it continue its motion or make it want to return to its original elevation. The parcel likes
where it was, and it likes its new position too. Such an atmospheric is said to be
neutrally stable.
Figure 40 was drawn for a dry atmosphere; that is, as a parcel moves upward,
the air remains unsaturated, there is no condensation of moisture, and it cools at
10°C/km. If condensation does occur, the adiabatic lapse rate drops to around
6°C/km and that slope determines the condition of neutral stability. Figure 41
shows a summary of how lapse rates determine atmospheric stability. If the ambient
lapse rate shows cooling at a faster rate than the dry adiabatic lapse rate, the atmosphere is absolutely unstable. The air will always want to move to some new altitude
so vertical dispersion of pollution is enhanced. For ambient temperatures that cool
less rapidly than the saturated adiabatic lapse rate, the atmosphere is absolutely
stable. That air wants to stay where it is. For ambient lapse rates between the dry
and wet adiabatic lapse rates, the atmosphere may be stable or it may be unstable;

443

Air Pollution

we can’t tell without knowing the actual ambient temperature profile and the actual
adiabatic profile. That region is labeled as having conditional stability.
An extreme case of a subadiabatic lapse rate is one in which ambient temperatures increase with altitude. Such temperature inversions yield a very stable air mass
and pollution tends to stay trapped there. The heating caused by absorption of
incoming solar energy by oxygen and ozone in the upper atmosphere creates a
stratospheric temperature inversion. That inversion causes the stratosphere to be extremely stable, often trapping pollutants for many years.

Temperature Inversions
Temperature inversions represent the extreme case of atmospheric stability, creating
a virtual lid on the upward movement of pollution. There are several causes of inversions, but the two that are the most important from an air quality standpoint are
radiation inversions and subsidence inversions. Radiation inversions are caused by
nocturnal cooling of the Earth’s surface, especially on clear winter nights. The second, subsidence inversions, are the result of the compressive heating of descending
air masses in high pressure zones. There are other, less important, causes of inversions such as frontal inversions. A frontal inversion is created when a cold air mass
passes under a warm air mass, but these are short lived and tend to be accompanied
by precipitation that cleanses the air. There are also inversions associated with geographical features of the landscape. Warm air passing over a cold body of water, for
example, creates an inversion. There are also inversions in valleys when cold air
rolls down the canyons at night under warmer air that might exist aloft.
Radiation Inversions. The surface of the Earth cools down at night by radiating
energy toward space. On a cloudy night, the Earth’s radiation tends to be absorbed
by water vapor, which in turn reradiates some of that energy back to the ground. On
a clear night, however, the surface more readily radiates energy to space, and thus
ground cooling occurs much more rapidly. As the ground cools, the temperature of
the air in contact with the ground also drops. As is often the case on clear winter
nights, the temperature of this air just above the ground becomes colder than the air
above it, creating an inversion.
Radiation inversions begin to form at about dusk. As the evening progresses,
the inversion extends to a higher and higher elevation, reaching perhaps a few hundred meters before the morning sun warms the ground again, breaking up the inversion. Figure 42 shows the development of a radiation inversion through the night,
followed by the erosion of the inversion that takes place the next day.
Radiation inversions occur close to the ground, mostly during the winter, and
lasts for only a matter of hours. They often begin at about the time traffic builds up
in the early evening, which traps auto exhaust at ground level and causes elevated
concentrations of pollution for commuters. Without sunlight, photochemical reactions can’t take place, so the biggest problem is usually the accumulation of carbon
monoxide (CO). In the morning, as the sun warms the ground and the inversion
begins to break up, pollutants that have been trapped in the stable air mass are suddenly brought back to Earth in a process known as fumigation. Fumigation can
cause short-lived, high concentrations of pollution at ground level.

FIGURE 42 Development of a radiation inversion (a), and the subsequent erosion of the
inversion (b). The times are representative only. The breakup of the inversion in the morning
leads to a process called fumigation during which pollution at ground level can rapidly increase.

Radiation inversions are important in another context besides air pollution.
Fruit growers in places like California have long known that their crops are in greatest danger of frost damage on winter nights when the skies are clear and a radiation
inversion sets in. Since the air even a few meters up is warmer than the air at crop
level, one way to help protect sensitive crops on such nights is simply to mix the air
with large motor-driven fans.
Subsidence Inversions. While radiation inversions are mostly a short-lived,
ground-level, wintertime phenomenon, the other important cause of inversions, subsidence, creates quite the opposite characteristics. Subsidence inversions may last for
months on end, occur at higher elevations, and are more common in summer than
winter.
Subsidence inversions are associated with high-pressure weather systems,
known as anticyclones. Air in the middle of a high pressure zone is descending,
while on the edges, it is rising. Air near the ground moves outward from the center,
while air aloft moves toward the center from the edges. The result is a massive vertical circulation system. As air in the center of the system falls, it experiences greater
pressure and is compressed and heated. If its temperature at elevation z1 is T1, then
as it falls to elevation z2, it will be heated adiabatically to T2 = T1 + ≠d (z1 - z2), as
shown in Figure 43. As is often the case, this compressive heating warms the
descending air to a higher temperature than the air below, whose temperature is
dictated primarily by conditions on the ground.
Since subsiding air gets warmer as it descends, it is better able to hold whatever water vapor it may have without condensing. Unless there are sources of new
moisture, its relative humidity drops, and there is little chance that clouds will form.
The result is that high-pressure zones create clear, dry weather with lots of sunshine
during the day and clear skies at night. Clear skies during the day allow solar warming of the Earth’s surface, which often creates superadiabatic conditions under the
inversion. The result of subsidence and surface warming is an inversion located anywhere from several hundred meters above the surface to several thousand meters,
that lasts as long as the high-pressure weather system persists. At night, the surface
can cool quickly by radiation, which may result in a radiation inversion located
under the subsidence inversion, as shown in Figure 44.

under the subsidence inversion when nights are clear, especially in winter (c).

Some anticyclones and their accompanying subsidence inversions drift across
the continents (west to east in northern midlatitudes) so that at any given spot they
may appear to come and go with some frequency. On the other hand, other anticyclones are semipermanent in nature and can cause subsidence inversions to last for
months at a time. These semipermanent highs are the result of the general atmospheric circulation patterns shown in Figure 45.
At the equinox, the equator is directly under the sun, and the air there will be
heated, become buoyant, and rise. As that air approaches the top of the troposphere
(roughly 10 to 12 km), it begins to turn, some heading north and some south. An
eighteenth century meteorologist, George Hadley, postulated that the air would continue to the poles before descending. In actuality, it descends at a latitude of about
30° and then returns to the equator, forming what is known as a Hadley cell. In similar fashion, though not as distinct, there are other cells, linked as in a chain,
between 30° and 60° latitude, and between 60° and the poles. The descending air at

High-pressure zones are common around 30° latitude producing clear skies

30° creates a persistent high-pressure zone with corresponding lack of clouds
or rainfall that is a contributing factor to the creation of the world’s great deserts.
The deserts of southern California, the southwestern United States, the Sahara, the
Chilean desert, the Kalahari in South Africa, and the great deserts in Australia, are
all located at roughly 30° latitude for this reason. Conversely, rising air near
the equator and near 60° latitude tends to be moist after passing over oceans. As it
cools, the moisture condenses, causing clouds and rainfall. For this reason, some of
the wettest regions of the world are in those bands of latitude.
The air that moves along the surface of the Earth to close a Hadley cell is
affected by Coriolis forces, causing it to curve toward the west if it is moving toward
the equator or toward the east if it is moving toward the poles. The resulting winds
between roughly 30° and 60° are known as the westerlies, and between the 30° and
the equator they are the trade winds. Near the equator, there is little wind since the
air is mostly rising. That band is called the equatorial doldrums. Similarly, the surface
air is relatively calm around 30° latitude, forming a band called the horse latitudes.
(Apparently early explorers were sometimes forced to lighten the load by throwing
horses overboard to avoid being becalmed as they sailed to the New World.)
All of these important bands of latitudes, the doldrums, horse latitudes, highpressure and low-pressure zones, move up and down the globe as the seasons
change. Figure 45 shows global circulation patterns at an equinox, when the sun is
directly over the equator. In Northern Hemisphere summer, the sun moves

447

Air Pollution

northward, as do the persistent high- and low-pressure zones associated with these
bands. There is, for example, a massive high-pressure zone off the coast of
California that moves into place over Los Angeles (latitude 34°) and San Francisco
(latitude 38°) in the spring, that remains there until late fall. That is the principal
reason for California’s sunny climate, as well as its smog. Clear skies assure plenty
of sunlight to power photochemical reactions, the lack of rainfall eliminates that
atmospheric cleansing mechanism, and prolonged subsidence inversions concentrate
the pollutants. In the case of Los Angeles, there is also a ring of mountains around
the city that tends to keep winds from blowing the smog away. In the Northern
Hemisphere winter, the sun is directly overhead somewhere in the Southern
Hemisphere, and the bands move southward.
The global circulation patterns of Figure 45 are, of course, idealized. The interactions between sea and land, the effects of storms and other periodic disturbances, and geographical features such as high mountain ranges all make this model
useful only on a macroscale. Even a simplified global model, however, helps explain
a number of significant features of the world’s climate and some aspects of regional
air pollution problems.

Atmospheric Stability and Mixing Depth
Atmospheric stability is important because it determines the ability of pollutants to
disperse vertically into the atmosphere. We already know that layers of the atmosphere have stability characteristics that depend on their local lapse rate in comparison with adiabatic lapse rates. That picture is incomplete, however, and we must
introduce another conceptual experiment before we can be sure of the consequences
of local lapse rates.
Consider the temperature profile in Figure 46a and, for the moment, assume
that the air is dry so we don’t have to worry about the difference between dry and
saturated lapse rates. If we look only at the lapse rates, the layer of air from ground
up to 0.5 km is superadiabatic, and should be labeled “unstable”; the layer from 0.5
to 1.5 km is subadiabatic and labeled “stable”; and the layer above 1.5 km has a
lapse rate equal to the dry adiabatic lapse rate 10°C/km and labeled “neutral.” Call
these “local” stability classifications.
Now consider three parcels of air, labeled 1, 2, and 3, in Figure 46b. If for some
reason one of these parcels starts to move up or down, its temperature will change by
10°C/km. After imagining that the parcel has moved, compare its temperature with
the temperature of the surrounding air at the new altitude. If the parcel is warmer, it
will be buoyant and will rise; if it is colder than the surrounding air, it will be denser
and will sink. With this in mind, consider parcel 1. If for some reason parcel 1 starts
to move slightly upward, it will cool at the dry adiabatic lapse rate of 10°C/km, making it warmer than the surrounding air, so the parcel will continue rising on its own.
If parcel 2 starts to rise, however, it will find itself colder than the surrounding air, so
it will sink back to where it started from. If it sinks below its initial level, it will be
colder than surrounding air and will continue to sink. If parcel 3 starts down, it will
be warmer than the surrounding air and will rise back to where it was.
So, how far up will parcel 1 go? It will keep rising as long as it is warmer than
the surrounding air. As shown in 46c, it will rise to 1 km and then stop. If it went
higher than 1 km, it would find itself colder than its surroundings and would sink

back to 1 km. In other words, air from ground-level to 1 km will actually experience
turbulent mixing despite the “stable” lapse rate above 0.5 km.
The process illustrated in Figure 46 helps provide a sense of the ability of the
atmosphere to provide dilution of air pollutants. By projecting the ground temperature upwards at the dry adiabatic lapse rate until it crosses the actual ambient
temperature profile, a region of turbulent mixing is identified. The altitude of the
top of that mixed layer is called the mixing depth (or, sometimes, the mixing
height).
The product of mixing depth and average windspeed within the mixing depth
is sometimes used as an indicator of the atmosphere’s dispersive capability. This
product is known as the ventilation coefficient (m2/s). Values of ventilation coefficient less than about 6,000 m2/s are considered indicative of high air pollution
potential (Portelli and Lewis, 1987).

Smokestack Plumes and Adiabatic Lapse Rates
The atmospheric temperature profile affects the dispersion of pollutants from a
smokestack, as shown in Figure 47. If a smokestack were to emit pollutants into a
neutrally stable atmosphere, we might expect the plume to be relatively symmetrical, as shown in Figure 47a. The term used to describe this plume is coning. In
Figure 47b, the atmosphere is very unstable, and there is rapid vertical air movement, both up and down, producing a looping plume. In Figure 47c, a fanning
plume results when a stable atmosphere greatly restricts the dispersion of the plume

in the vertical direction, although it still spreads horizontally. In Figure 47d, when a
stack is under an inversion layer, emissions move downward much more easily than
upward. The resulting fumigation can lead to greatly elevated downwind, groundlevel concentrations.
When the stack is above an inversion layer, as in Figure 47e, mixing in the upward direction is uninhibited, but downward motion is greatly restricted by the inversion’s stable air. Such lofting helps keep the pollution high above the ground,
reducing exposure to people living downwind. In fact, a common approach to air
pollution control in the past has been to build taller and taller stacks to emit pollutants above inversions. An unfortunate consequence of this approach, however, has
been that pollutants released from tall stacks are able to travel great distances and
may cause unexpected effects, such as acid deposition, hundreds of miles from the
source.

11

The Point Source Gaussian Plume Model
The Clean Air Act specifies new source emission standards, and it specifies ambient
air quality standards. The connecting link between the two is the atmosphere. How
do pollutants behave once they have been emitted, and how may we predict their
concentrations in the atmosphere? How can the limitations imposed by a Prevention
of Significant Deterioration policy be shown to be satisfied for new sources in an
attainment area? How can we predict the improvement in air quality that must be
achieved when new sources are proposed for a nonattainment area? To help answer
questions like these, computer models that use such information as predicted emissions, smokestack heights, wind data, atmospheric temperature profiles, ambient
temperatures, solar insolation, and local terrain features have been developed and
will be discussed in this section.
At the heart of almost every computer program that attempts to relate emissions to air quality is the assumption that the time-averaged pollutant concentration
downwind from a source can be modeled using a normal, or Gaussian, distribution
curve. The basic Gaussian dispersion model applies to a single point source such as a
smokestack, but it can be modified to account for line sources (such as emissions
from motor vehicles along a highway), or area sources (these can be modeled as a
large number of point sources).
To begin, consider just a single point source such as that shown in Figure 48.
The coordinate system has been set up to show a cross-section of the plume, with z
representing the vertical direction and x the distance directly downwind from the
source. If we were to observe the plume at any particular instant, it might have some
irregular shape, such as the outline of the looping plume shown. A few minutes later,
however, the plume might have an entirely different boundary. If we were to set up a
camera and leave the shutter open for a while, we could imagine getting a photograph of a time-averaged plume envelope such as that shown in the figure.
Since stack emissions have some initial upward velocity and buoyancy, it might
be some distance downwind before the plume envelope might begin to look symmetrical about a centerline. The centerline would be somewhat above the actual

stack height. The highest concentration of pollution would be along this centerline,
with decreasing concentrations as the distance from this centerline increases. The
Gaussian plume model assumes that the pollutant concentration follows a normal
distribution about this centerline in both the vertical plane, as shown in the figure,
and in the horizontal direction, not shown. It also treats emissions as if they came
from a virtual point source along the plume centerline, at an effective stack height H.
The Gaussian point-source dispersion equation relates average, steady-state
pollutant concentrations to the source strength, windspeed, effective stack height,
and atmospheric conditions. Its form can be derived from basic considerations
involving gaseous diffusion in three-dimensional space. The derivation, however,
is beyond the scope of this book (see, for example, Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998). It is
important to note the following assumptions that are incorporated into the
analysis:
• The rate of emissions from the source is constant.
• The windspeed is constant both in time and with elevation.
• The pollutant is conservative; that is, it is not lost by decay, chemical reaction,
or deposition. When it hits the ground, none is absorbed, and all is reflected.
• The terrain is relatively flat, open country.
The three-dimensional coordinate system established in Figure 49 has the stack
at the origin, with distance directly downwind given by x, distance off the downwind
axis specified by y, and elevation given by z. Since our concern is going to be only with
receptors (people and ecosystems) at ground-level, the form of the Gaussian plume
equation given here is less general than it can be, and applies only for z = 0:

sz = vertical dispersion coefficient (standard deviation), m
Before we get into the details of (45), several features are worth noting.
Ground-level pollution concentration is directly proportional to the source strength
Q, so it is easy to determine how much source reduction is necessary to achieve a
desired decrease in downwind concentration. The units of Q, by the way, have been
given in micrograms so concentrations will be in the usual micrograms per cubic
meter (mg/m3). The ground-level pollution decreases when taller stacks are used,
although the relationship is not linear. Also note that there is no explicit relationship
between emission rate, Q, and downwind distance, x. The downwind distance will
be brought into the equation when sx and sy are evaluated.
Equation (45) suggests that downwind concentration appears to be inversely
proportional to the windspeed, which is what might be expected intuitively. In
actuality, the inverse relationship is slightly modified by the dependence of plume
rise ¢h on windspeed. Higher windspeeds reduce the effective height of the stack H,
which keeps ground-level pollution from dropping quite as much as a simple inverse
relationship would imply.

453

Air Pollution

Finally, and most important, although the Gaussian plume equation is based
on both theory and actual measured data, it is still, at best, a crude model.
Predictions based on the model should be assumed to be accurate to within perhaps
;50 percent. In spite of that uncertainty, however, it is still very useful since it has
almost universal acceptance, is easy to use, and allows comparison between the
estimates made by different modelers in varying situations.

Windspeed Changes with Elevation
The windspeed to be used in (42), uH, is the windspeed at the effective stack height.
Usually windspeed is measured with an anemometer that is set up at a height of 10
meters above the ground, so we need some way to relate windspeed at the
anemometer height with windspeed at the effective stack height. The following
power law expression is frequently used for elevations less than a few hundred meters above the ground:

terrain such as flat fields, or near bodies of water, the values of p given in Table 6
should be multiplied by 0.6. The stability class indicators in the table will be further clarified in Table 7, when we compute the characteristics of smokestack

The Gaussian Dispersion Coefficients
The two dispersion coefficients in (45), sy and sz, need explanation. These are really
just the standard deviations of the horizontal and vertical Gaussian distributions, respectively (about 68 percent of the area under a Gaussian curve is within ;1s of the
mean value). Smaller values for a dispersion coefficient mean the Gaussian curve is narrower, with a higher peak, and larger values mean the opposite. The further downwind
we go from the source, the larger these coefficients become. This causes the Gaussian
curves to spread further and further. These coefficients are not only a function of downwind distance, but they also depend, in a complex way, on atmospheric stability.
The most common procedure for estimating the dispersion coefficients was
introduced by Pasquill (1961), modified by Gifford (1961), and adopted by the
U.S. Public Health Service (Turner, 1970); it is presented here as Figure 50. The
parameters A through F in Figure 50 represent stability classifications based on

qualitative descriptions of prevailing environmental conditions. Table 7 describes
these parameters. For example, a clear summer day, with the sun higher than 60°
above the horizon, having windspeeds less than 2 m/s (at an elevation of 10 m), creates a very unstable atmosphere with stability classification A. The opposite extreme
is classification F, which is labeled stable and corresponds to a clear night (less than
3>8 of the sky covered by clouds), with winds less than 3 m/s.
The graphical presentation of dispersion coefficients in Figure 50 is inconvenient when doing calculations with a computer. A reasonable fit to those graphs can
be obtained using the following equations (Martin, 1976):
sy = a x0.894

sz = cxd + f

and
where the constants a, c, d, and f are given in Table 8 for each stability classification.
The downwind distance x must be expressed in kilometers to yield sy and sz in meters. For convenience, a few values for the dispersion coefficients calculated using

The following example illustrates the use of the Gaussian plume equation.
EXAMPLE 12 A Power Plant Plume
A 40 percent-efficient, 1,000 MW (106 kW) coal-fired power plant emits SO2 at
the legally allowable rate of 0.6 lb SO2 per million Btu of heat into the plant. The
stack has an effective height of 300 m. An anemometer on a 10-m pole measures
2.5 m/s of wind, and it is a cloudy summer day. Predict the ground-level concentration of SO2 4 km directly downwind.
Solution We know the output power of the plant, 106 kW, but emission
standards are written in terms of input power. Using the conversion 3,412 Btu =
1 kWh, the input power is
Input power =

For the anemometer windspeed and solar conditions given, Table 7 indicates that
the appropriate stability classification is C. Note that Table 7 uses the windspeed
as measured at the standard 10-m anemometer height. The windspeed in the
Gaussian plume equation, however, requires that we estimate the wind at the effective stack height. We did that in Example 11 and found it to be 4.9 m/s at 300
meters.
At 4 km downwind, Table 9 indicates the dispersion coefficients are
sy = 359 m and sz = 216 m. Plugging these into (49) gives
C(4, 0) =

6.47 * 108 mg/s
p * 4.9 m/s * 359 m * 216 m

expc

-(300)2

d = 206 mg/m3

Using 24.465 * 10-3 m3/mol (at 1 atm, 25°C) along with the molecular weight
of SO2 (32 + 2 * 16 = 64 g/mol), we can convert units to the more commonly
used ppm:
C =

458

206 * 10-6 g/m3 * 24.465 * 10-3 m3/mol
46 g/mol

= 0.109 * 10-6 = 0.109 ppm

Air Pollution

So the power plant in Example 12 would add 0.11 ppm to whatever SO2 level
is already there from other sources. For perspective, let us compare these emissions
to ambient air-quality standards. Table 1 indicates that the annual average SO2 concentration must be less than 0.03 ppm, which means this power plant by itself
would cause pollution to greatly exceed that standard if these atmospheric conditions prevailed over the full year. The 24-hour SO2 standard is 0.14 ppm, so under
the conditions stated, this plant would not violate that standard, but it would make
it difficult to allow any other sources in the area.
Example 12 opens the door to many interesting questions. How does the concentration vary as distance downwind changes? What would be the effect of changes
in windspeed or stability classification? How would we utilize statistical data on
windspeed, wind direction, and atmospheric conditions to be sure that all air-quality standards will be met? If they will not be met, what are the alternatives? Some examples come to mind. We might raise the stack height (adding to the acid deposition
problem); we might increase the efficiency of the scrubber to clean flue gases, or we
might recommend using coal with a lower sulfur content. Perhaps energy conservation efforts might reduce the size of the power plant required to meet
projected needs. Clearly, to do a proper siting analysis for a new source, such as the
power plant in Example 12, would require a complex study. Though we will not
carry out such calculations here, we do have the crucial starting point for such a
study—namely the Gaussian plume model.

Peak Downwind Concentration
Plotting (49) by hand is tedious, especially if we want to do a sensitivity analysis to
see how the results change with changing stack heights and atmospheric conditions.
It is much easier to work this out with a computer, and it is especially simple if a
spreadsheet program with graphics capability is used. Using Example 12 as a base
case, the effect of changes in effective stack height on downwind concentration has
been plotted in Figure 51a. The effect of changing stability class, while keeping stack
height constant at 300 m, is shown in Figure 51b.
The downwind concentration of pollution is sensitive to changes in effective
stack height, as can be seen in Figure 51a. Raising the effective stack height from
250 to 300 m reduces the peak concentration by more than half. That ability of tall
stacks to cut ground-level pollution significantly has led to some tremendously tall
stacks. In fact, the tallest stack in the world is for a smelter in Subdury, Ontario, and
it is as tall as the Empire State Building in New York (380 m). The effective stack
height would be even higher.
The impact of changing stability classification shown in Figure 51b is perhaps
unexpected. The highest peak downwind concentration occurs when the
atmosphere is very unstable rather than stable. The turbulence in an unstable
atmosphere brings the looping plume to Earth very quickly, resulting in high peak
values near the stack. Downwind, however, concentrations drop off very quickly.
Having a high peak concentration near the stack may be a satisfactory situation as
long as any populations or ecosystems that might be damaged by the pollution are
more than a few kilometers away.
The stable atmosphere shown in Figure 51b, on the other hand, causes a relatively low peak concentration. The diagram of a fanning plume in Figure 47c
may help you to understand that conclusion. The plume fans out horizontally, but

not much reaches the ground until the plume is some distance downwind. As shown
in Figure 51b, the stable atmosphere is worse than the unstable atmospheres beyond
about 14 km. It should be noted, however, that the concentrations shown in Figure 51
do not account for the fact that effective stack height depends on the stability classification. If that complication is included, the high peaks shown for unstable atmospheres are reduced modestly.
An obvious question is how can the peak downwind concentration be predicted from (49)? Unfortunately, it is not possible to derive a mathematical
solution. One way to predict the peak is to simply plot curves of the sort shown in
Figure 51 using a computer. With the ready availability of PCs and spreadsheet programs, that has become an easy enough way to deal with the problem. For hand calculations, however, this approach would be far too tedious. Turner (1970) has
derived curves that use the stability classification and effective stack height as
parameters to find the distance downwind to the maximum concentration (xmax).

Air Pollution

The same process yields a normalized concentration (CuH >Q)max, from which the
maximum concentration can be found using the following:
Cmax =

(50)

The curves are presented in Figure 52, and the following example illustrates their use.

EXAMPLE 13 Peak Downwind Concentration
For the 1,000 MW, coal-fired power plant of Example 12, use Figure 52 to determine the distance downwind to reach the maximum SO2 concentration. Then
find that concentration.
Solution The stability classification is C, and the effective stack height is 300 m.
From Figure 52, the distance downwind, xmax, is about 4 km (which agrees with
Figure 51). Note the scales on Figure 52 are logarithmic, so be careful when reading values.
Reading across from the point on the figure corresponding to stability
class C and effective stack height H = 300 m, (CuH >Q) max looks to be about
1.5 * 10-6 m-2.

Plume Rise
So far, we have dealt only with effective stack height H in the calculations. The difference between the actual stack height h and the effective height H is called the
plume rise ¢h. Plume rise is caused by a combination of factors, the most important
ones being the buoyancy and momentum of the exhaust gases, and the stability of
the atmosphere itself. Buoyancy results when exhaust gases are hotter than the
ambient air, or when the molecular weight of the exhaust is lower than that of air
(or a combination of both factors). Momentum is caused by the mass and velocity of
the gases as they leave the stack.
A number of techniques have been proposed in the literature for dealing with
plume rise, and they tend to yield very different results. The EPA recommends a
model based on work by Briggs (1972), and so we will use it. Plume rise depends on
momentum and buoyancy. The buoyancy assumed in this analysis is due to the temperature of the stack gases being higher than the surrounding ambient, but one
could also include differences in molecular weight of the exhaust gas versus air.
The following plume rise equation can be used for stable conditions (stability
categories E and F):

EXAMPLE 14 Plume Rise
A large power plant has a 250-m stack with inside radius 2 m. The exit velocity
of the stack gases is estimated at 15 m/s, at a temperature of 140°C (413 K).
Ambient temperature is 25°C (298 K), and winds at stack height are estimated to
be 5 m/s. Estimate the effective height of the stack if (a) the atmosphere is stable
with temperature increasing at the rate of 2°C/km, and (b) the atmosphere is
slightly unstable, class C.

Downwind Concentration Under a Temperature Inversion
The Gaussian plume equation, as presented thus far, applies to an atmosphere in
which the temperature profile is a simple straight line. If, as is often the case, there is
an inversion above the effective stack height, then the basic Gaussian equation must
be modified to account for the fact that the vertical dispersion of pollutants is
limited by the inversion.
If the pollutants are assumed to reflect off the inversion layer, just as they were
assumed to reflect off the ground in the basic Gaussian equation, then an estimate
of the concentration at any point downwind would require an analysis of these multiple reflections. That complexity can be avoided if we are willing to restrict our
predictions of plume concentration to distances far enough downwind that the summation of these multiple reflections converges into a closed form solution. Beyond
that distance, the air is considered to be completely mixed under the inversion, with
uniform concentrations from ground level to the bottom of the inversion layer.
Turner (1970) suggests the following modified Gaussian equation to estimate
ground-level concentrations downwind under an inversion. It is derived based on
the assumption that the downwind distance from the source is at least twice the distance to where the plume first interacts with the inversion layer:
C(x, 0) =

where
L = elevation of the bottom of the inversion layer (m)
XL = the distance downwind where the plume first encounters the inversion
layer
Notice that (55) is applicable only for distances x Ú 2XL (see Figure 53). That
distance, XL, occurs at the point where the vertical dispersion coefficient, sz, is
equal to
sz = 0.47(L - H) at x = XL
(56)
After sz is found from (56), the distance XL can be estimated using Figure 50b, or
using (48) and Table 7.

Air Pollution

For distances x … XL, the standard Gaussian plume equation (42) can be used
to estimate downwind concentrations. For XL Ú 2XL, (55) applies. For distances
between XL and 2XL, concentrations can be estimated by interpolating between the
values computed for x = XL and x = 2XL.
EXAMPLE 15 Concentration Under an Inversion Aloft
Consider a stack with effective height 100 m, emitting SO2 at the rate of
2 * 108 mg/s. Windspeed at 10 m is 5.5 m/s, and at 100 m, it is 10 m/s. It is a
clear summer day with the sun nearly overhead and an inversion layer starting at
300 m. Estimate the ground-level SO2 concentration at a distance downwind
twice that where reflection begins to occur from the inversion.
Solution

Equation (56) gives sz at the distance XL,
sz = 0.47(L - H) = 0.47 * (300 - 100) = 94 m

To find XL, we can use Figure 50b, but first we need the stability classification
below the inversion. From Table 7, a clear summer day with 5.5 m/s windspeed
corresponds to stability class C. We need to find XL in order to find sY in (55).
Entering Figure 50b on the vertical axis at sz = 94 m, then going across to the
class C line and dropping down to the horizontal axis, leads to a very rough
estimate for XL of about 1,600 m.
To find the concentration at x = 2XL = 2 * 1,600 m = 3,200 m, we need
to estimate sy at that point. Using Figure 47a at x = 3,200 m and class C, we can
estimate sy to be about 300 m (we could have used Eq. 47 with Table 8). Using
(55), the concentration directly downwind at ground-level is

A Line-Source Dispersion Model
In some circumstances, it is appropriate to model sources distributed along a line as
if they formed a continuously emitting, infinite line source. Examples of line sources
that might be modeled this way include motor vehicles traveling along a straight section of highway, agricultural burning along the edge of a field, or a line of industrial
sources on the banks of a river. For simplicity, we will consider only the case of an
infinite-length source at ground-level, with winds blowing perpendicular to the line
as shown in Figure 54.
Under these specialized circumstances, the ground-level concentration of pollution at perpendicular distance x from the line source can be described by the following:
C(x) =

2q
22p szu

where
q = emission rate per unit of distance along the line (g/m-s).

EXAMPLE 16 CO Near a Freeway
The federal emission standards for CO from new vehicles is 3.4 g/mile. Suppose a
highway has 10 vehicles per second passing a given spot, each emitting 3.4 g/mile
of CO. If the wind is perpendicular to the highway and blowing at 5 mph
(2.2 m/s) on an overcast day, estimate the ground-level CO concentration 100 m
from the freeway.
Solution

We need to estimate the CO emission rate per meter of freeway,

q = 10 vehicles/s * 3.4 g/veh-mile * 1 mile/1,609 m = 0.021 g/s-m
and we need the vertical dispersion coefficient sz. Since this is an overcast day,
the footnotes of Table 7 indicate we should use stability class D. Checking Table 9
for sz doesn’t help since it doesn’t give values for such short distances. So, with
(48) and values of c, d, and f from Table 8, we can compute sz:
sz = cxd + f = 33.2(0.1)0.725 - 1.7 = 4.6 m
Substituting these values into (57) gives
C(0.1 km) =

2 * 0.021 g/m # s * 103 mg/g

2q
22p szu

=

(2p)1>2 * 4.6 m * 2.2 m/s

= 1.7 mg/m3

The eight-hour CO air quality standard is 10 mg/m3, so this estimate is well
below the standard.

Area-Source Models
For distributed sources, a number of approaches can be taken to estimate pollutant
concentrations. If there are a modest number of point sources, it is reasonable to use
the point-source Gaussian plume equation for each source to predict its individual

contribution. Then, by superposition, find the total concentration at a given
location by summing the individual contributions. Multiple use of the Gaussian
line-source equation is another approach. By dividing an area into a series of parallel strips and then treating each strip as a line source, the total concentration on any
strip can be estimated.
A much simpler, more intuitive approach can be taken to estimate pollutant
concentrations over an area (such as a city) by using the box model concepts introduced in Section 1.3. Consider the airshed over an urban area to be represented by a
rectangular box, such as is shown in Figure 55, with base dimensions L and W and
height H. The box is oriented so that wind, with speed u, is normal to one side of the
box. The height of the box is determined by atmospheric conditions, and we could
consider it to be just the mixing depth. Emissions per unit area will be represented
by qs (g/m2-s).
Consider the air blowing into the box on the upwind side to have pollutant
concentration Cin, and, for simplicity, assume that no pollution is lost from the box
along the sides parallel to the wind or from the top. We will also assume that the
pollutants are rapidly and completely mixed in the box, creating a uniform average
concentration C. Finally, we will treat the pollutants as if they are conservative, that
is, they do not react, decay, or fall out of the air stream. All of these restrictions can
be modified in more sophisticated versions of a box model.
Working with pollutant mass, the amount of pollution in the box is the volume
of the box times the concentration, LWHC. The rate at which air is entering and
leaving the box is the area of either end times the windspeed, WHu, so the rate at
which pollution is entering the box is WHuCin. The rate that it leaves the box is
WHuC. If we assume the pollutant is conservative, then we can then write the following mass balance for the box:

The steady-state solution to (58) can be obtained by simply setting dC>dt = 0

(59)

which looks reasonable. If the air entering the box is clean, the steady-state concentration is proportional to the emission rate and inversely proportional to the ventilation coefficient (the product of mixing depth and windspeed). If it is not clean, we
just add the effect of the incoming concentration. We can also solve (58) to obtain
the time-dependent increase in pollution above the city. Letting C(0) be the concentration in the airshed above the city (the box) at time t = 0, the solution becomes
C(t) = a

C(t) =

(61)

When t = L>u, the exponential function becomes e-1 and the concentration reaches
about 63 percent of its final value. That value of time has various names. It is called
the time constant, the ventilation time, the residence time, or the e-folding time.

EXAMPLE 17 Evening Rush Hour Traffic
Suppose within a square city, 15 km on a side, there are 200,000 cars on the road,
each being driven 30 km between 4 PM and 6 PM, and each emitting 3 g/km of
CO. It is a clear winter evening with a radiation inversion that restricts mixing to
20 m. The wind is bringing clean air at a steady rate of 1.0 m/s along an edge of
the city. Use a box model to estimate the CO concentration at 6 PM if there was
no CO in the air at 4 PM, and the only source of CO is cars. Assume that CO is
conservative and that there is complete and instantaneous mixing in the box.
Solution

The emissions per m2, qs, would be

qs =

200,000 cars * 30 km/car * 3 g/km

which is considerably below both the 1-hr NAAQS for CO of 40 mg/m3 and the
eight-hour standard of 10 mg/m3. Any CO that was already in the air at 4 PM would,
of course, increase this estimate. The time constant, L>u = 15,000 m>(1 m/s) =
15,000 s = 4.2 hours, suggests that in these 2 hours, the concentration is well
below what it would become if these conditions were to continue.

Indoor Air Quality
This chapter began with the rather startling assertion that, in terms of human exposure to respirable particulate matter, a 2 percent reduction in emissions of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) would be equivalent to eliminating all the coal-fired
power plants in the United States (Smith, 1993b). The key, of course, goes back to
the theme of Chapter 5 that health effects are the result of exposure, not emissions.
We are exposed to chemicals and particulates in the air we breathe, and the air we
breathe is mostly inside of buildings where we spend almost all of our time.
Some of the indoor pollutants are the same ones that we are now familiar with
from our study of ambient air quality. For example, combustion that takes place inside of homes and other buildings to cook, heat water, and provide space heating and
cooling can produce elevated levels of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and other respirable particulates. Cigarette smoke emits carbon monoxide,
benzene, acrolein, and other aldehydes, and particulates, as well as about 4,000
other chemicals. Some photocopying machines emit ozone. Building materials such
as particleboard, plywood, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation, various adhesives,
and other building materials emit formaldehyde. Chipped and peeling paint containing lead becomes airborne toxic dust. A long list of volatile organic compounds are
emitted from household cleaning products, paints, carpeting, and a variety of other
chemicals we use in our homes.
Some pollutants are somewhat unique to the indoor environment, such as asbestos used for fireproofing and insulation, radon gas that seeps out of the soil and
collects in houses, and biological pollutants such as bacteria, molds, animal dander,
dust mites, pollen, and viruses. One indoor bacterium, Legionella, has caused both
Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever. Many pollutants, such as cigarette smoke or
radon gas, if they are emitted outdoors, have adequate dilution air so people tend
not to be exposed to hazardous levels of contamination. Indoors, however, these
pollutants can be concentrated, leading all too often to harmful exposure levels.
Air pollution in homes is largely under our control, but in offices and other
workplaces, we depend on the builder’s choice of materials used in construction and

the proper design and maintenance of building air filtration and ventilation systems.
It is not at all unusual these days for occupants of new and remodeled buildings to
experience a bewildering array of symptoms that characterize what is now called
sick-building syndrome. Sneezing or coughing; watery eyes; headaches; eye, nose,
and throat irritation; dry or itchy skin; nausea and dizziness; fatigue; difficulty in
concentrating; and general malaise arise without any clearly identifiable causes.
Studies suggest that nearly 25 percent of U.S. office workers perceive air quality
problems in their work environments, and 20 percent believe their work is impaired
by reactions to indoor pollution (Kreiss, 1990). The importance of this field of study
has finally been recognized, and a considerable body of research is underway (Ott,
Steinemann, and Wallace, 2006).
Table 10 summarizes some of the sources and exposure guidelines for a number of pollutants that are commonly found in indoor environments.

Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS)
One category of indoor air pollution stands out from all others, and that is tobacco
smoke. It is estimated that about 26 percent of the U.S. adult population are smokers
who consume more than 500 billion cigarettes annually. Tobacco smoke contains

471

Air Pollution

more than 4,000 chemicals, including more than 40 that are known to cause cancer
in humans or animals, and many are strong respiratory irritants. Smoking is thought
to be responsible for between 80 and 90 percent of the lung cancer deaths in the
United States. The combined death rate from lung cancer, emphyzema, and cardiovascular disease attributable to smoking is over one-half million per year. Unfortunately, it is not only smokers who suffer the ill effects of tobacco.
First, let’s consider some terminology. Smokers inhale what is referred to as
mainstream smoke. Sidestream smoke, emitted from smoldering cigarettes, mixed
with smoke exhaled by smokers is known as environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) or
secondhand smoke. Breathing air with ETS is called involuntary or passive smoking.
In early 1993, the EPA released a report (Respiratory Health Effects of Passive
Smoking: Lung Cancer and Other Disorders) that concluded that ETS causes lung
cancer in adult nonsmokers and has serious effects on the respiratory system of children. ETS has been listed as a Group A, known human carcinogen. The EPA concludes that secondhand smoke is causing an estimated 3,000 lung cancer deaths
annually in the United States as well as 150,000 to 300,000 cases of pneumonia or
bronchitis among children under 18 months of age each year. It worsens the condition of up to 1 million asthmatic children. Smokers have nearly 10 times as much of
the carcinogen, benzene, in their blood as nonsmokers, and a pregnant smoker undoubtedly passes benzene to her developing fetus. That correlates with the fact that
children of smokers die of leukemia at several times the rate of children of nonsmokers. An even more recent study concludes that the incidence rate of sudden
infant death syndrome increases as exposure to tobacco smoke increases.

Asbestos
Another somewhat special indoor air-quality problem can be caused by asbestoscontaining materials. Asbestos used to be a common building material found in
structural fireproofing, heating-system insulation, floor and ceiling tiles, and roofing
felts and shingles. It has also been used in consumer products such as fireplace
gloves, ironing board covers, and certain hair dryers.
As some asbestos-containing materials age, or if they are physically damaged
in some way during their use, microscopic fibers may be dispersed into the indoor
air environment. Inhalation of these fibers can lead to a number of life-threatening
diseases, including asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. Asbestos fibers have
long been known to be human carcinogens; in fact, asbestos was one of the first substances categorized as a hazardous air pollutant under Section 112 of the Clean Air
Act. It was identified by the EPA as a hazardous pollutant in 1971, and in 1973, the
Asbestos National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP)
were initiated. An especially deadly combination is asbestos exposure along with
tobacco smoking, which elevates the lung cancer risk by approximately fivefold.
There are two broad categories of asbestos-containing materials: friable and
nonfriable. Friable materials are those that can be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced
to powder by hand pressure. Obviously, these are the most dangerous since asbestos
fibers are easily released into the environment. Nonfriable materials, such as vinyl
asbestos floor tiles and asphalt roofing products, do not usually require special handling even during demolition and renovation of buildings. Friable substances, on the
other hand, are subject to NESHAP during such work. Since disturbing asbestos

472

Air Pollution

that is in good condition may create more of a risk than simply sealing it in place, it
is often best not to attempt to remove asbestos-containing materials in a building
unless there is known to be a problem or major construction work is to ensue.

Radon
One of the most publicized indoor air pollution problems is caused by the accumulation of radon gas in some homes in some parts of the country. Radon gas and its
radioactive daughters are known carcinogens and may be the second leading cause
of lung cancer, after smoking.
Radon is a radioactive gas that is part of a natural decay chain beginning with
uranium and ending with lead. A simplified description of the sequence, along with
half-lives and alpha, gamma, and beta radiation emitted, is shown in Figure 56.
Radon gas formed in pore spaces between mineral grains in soil can work its way to
the surface where it can enter buildings through the floor. Radon itself is inert, but its
short-lived decay products—polonium, lead, and bismuth—are chemically active
and easily become attached to inhaled particles that can lodge in the lungs. In fact, it
is the alpha-emitting polonium, formed as radon decays, that causes the greatest lung
damage.
Radon can also be emitted from some earth-derived building materials such as
brick, concrete, and tiles. It can be captured in groundwater, to be released when

that water is aerated, for example, during showers (the radon risk in water is from
inhalation of the released gas, not from drinking the water itself). Radon has also
been detected in some natural gas supplies, so modest amounts may be released during cooking. By far, the most important source of radon, however, is through soils
under homes.
The units of measurement used in describing radon are somewhat unusual and
are summarized in Table 11. The decay rate of 1 gram of radium, 3.7 * 1010 disintegrations per second, is the origin of the Curie. A more intuitive unit is the
Becquerel, which corresponds to 1 radioactive decay per second. The working-levelmonth (WLM) is based on the exposure a miner received working 173 hours per
month. Indoor concentrations of radon have traditionally been expressed in
picocuries per liter of air (pCi/L). It is estimated that the average house in the United
States has 1.25 pCi/L, and around 6 million homes (6 percent of the total) have levels above 4 pCi/L, which is the EPA’s level of concern. Retrofitting those 6 million
U.S. homes with radon control measures could cost on the order of $50 billion.
Early estimates of the lung cancer risk associated with inhalation of radon and
its progeny were based in large part on epidemiologic studies of uranium miners
who had been exposed to high radon levels and for whom the incidence rate of lung
cancer was much higher than that of the general population. Translating data from
miners, however, to risks in residences introduces large uncertainties. Working miners, for example, would be expected to have higher breathing rates than people resting at home, they would be exposed to much greater concentrations of particulate
matter along with the radon, and they have much higher exposure to radon.
A number of recent studies have found evidence of elevated lung cancer rates
at the comparatively low radon levels found in homes. A 1994 Swedish report
showed progressively higher lung cancer rates as home radon exposure increased.
At exposure levels of 3.8 to 10.8 picocuries per liter (pCi/L), lung cancer risks
increased 30 percent over those who lived in homes with less than 1.4 pCi/L. Above
10.8 pCi/L, the incidence rate was 80 percent higher. The National Academy of
Science’s Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) VI Report in 1999 concluded that radon causes between 15,000 and 22,000 lung-cancer deaths per year in
the United States, with most of those being among smokers (NRC, 1999). Two confirming studies in the United States and in Europe in 2005 led the U.S. Surgeon
General to issue an indoor radon national health advisory.
Much of the danger associated with radon is caused by radon daughters that
attach themselves to small particulate matter that is inhaled deep into the lungs. The

combination of cigarette smoke and radon is, as a result, an especially deadly combination. According to data summarized in Table 12, only about 3 percent of the
radon mortality rate is estimated to occur among individuals who have never
smoked. If these data are true in general, well over 90 percent of the lung-cancer risk
associated with radon could be controlled by eliminating smoking without any
change in radon concentrations (Nazaroff and Teichman, 1990).
Homes built over radon-rich, high-permeability soils are most vulnerable to
elevated radon levels. The emanation rate from soil seems to range from about
0.1 pCi/m2-s to over 100 pCi/m2-s, with a value of 1 pCi/m2-s being fairly typical.
This large variation in emission rates is the principal cause of variations in indoor
radon concentrations measured across the country. When emission rates are low, as
is the case for most of the United States, homes can be tightly constructed for energy
efficiency without concern for elevated levels of radon. In areas where soil radon
emissions are high, tight building construction techniques can elevate indoor radon
concentrations. Smokers, of course, would be most affected.
The EPA, the U.S. Geological Survey, and Lawrence Berkeley National Labs
have attempted to evaluate the radon potential across the United States, which has
led to the development of radon maps such as the one shown in Figure 57. Such
maps help identify regions in which testing of existing homes for radon, as well as
recommendations for preventative radon control measures in new construction, are
most highly recommended. The usual threshold for action is 4 pCi/L. Since significant variations in radon are often found between one neighborhood and another
within the same city, decisions about remediation measures are best made after thorough testing of individual homes.
Available techniques to help reduce indoor radon concentrations depend
somewhat on what type of floor construction has been employed. Many houses in
the United States are built over basements that may or may not be heated; other
homes, especially in the west United States, are built over crawl spaces or on concrete slabs. Occupied basements present the greatest risk since the wall and floor
areas exposed to the soil are large, while the usual ventilation rate in basements is
low. With every type of construction, mitigation begins with efforts to seal any and
all cracks and openings between the floor and the soil beneath. For houses with
basements or crawl spaces, increased ventilation of those areas, either by natural or
mechanical means, can be very effective. If the basement is heated, a heat recovery

ventilator may be called for to increase ventilation without wasting excessive
amounts of energy. One of the most widely used radon reduction techniques uses
subslab suction as shown in Figure 58. Radon exhaust pipes pass through the floor
into the aggregate below. Fans suck the radon gas out of the aggregate and exhaust
it into the air above the house.

Exposure Assessment
Toxic chemicals affect human health when people are exposed to them. Perhaps it is
because this simple notion is so obvious that its importance is so often overlooked.
To be exposed to pollutants, they have to be in the air we breathe, the water we
drink, or the food we eat, so it makes sense to approach health risk assessment by
evaluating those pathways. Such an approach, called the total exposure assessment
methodology (TEAM), was launched by the EPA’s Office of Research and Development in 1979, and considerable data on actual exposures have now been collected
(Ott, Steinemann, and Wallace, 2006).
From the perspective of air pollution, the starting point for a total environmental assessment is to determine the amount of time spent indoors, in vehicles, and
outdoors. Large-scale field studies based on carefully kept diaries suggests that
Americans are inside of buildings 89 percent of the time, in vehicles 6 percent, and
are outdoors 74 minutes per day, or 5 percent of the time (Figure 59). Perhaps surprisingly, Californians, who might think they are outdoors much more than national
averages would suggest, are only slightly different, 6 percent outdoors rather than 5
(Jenkins, 1992). Also shown in Figure 59 are estimates of the time spent indoors in
less developed countries (LDCs). As countries develop, a greater fraction of their
populations live in urban areas and spend more time indoors.

The importance of the amount of time spent indoors is dramatized by studies
of human exposure to a number of especially important air pollutants. These TEAM
studies depend on actual exposure measurements made with personal air quality
monitors that accompany participants during their normal daily activities. Exposure
measurements are supplemented with blood gas analyses to verify the actual uptake
of pollutants. One such study (Smith, 1993b) estimates that per capita emissions
of particulates from coal-fired power plants in the United States are about 1.6 kg/
person, whereas emissions of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are roughly
0.050 kg/person. That is, coal plant particulate emissions are about 30 times higher
than ETS emissions. But coal plant emissions are released into a large reservoir, the

atmosphere, whereas almost all ETS particulates are released indoors, where there is
less dilution and where people spend most of their time. In terms of particulate
matter inhaled, it has been estimated that human exposure to ETS is 60 times the
exposure from coal-fired power plants even though ETS constitutes only 3 percent
of emissions. These data, summarized in Figure 60, suggest that major reductions in
coal plant emissions would have far lower overall effect on public health than what
could be realized with modest reductions in ETS.
Similar conclusions can be reached for the Class-A human carcinogen, benzene. Combustion of gasoline accounts for 82 percent of benzene emissions in the
United States, whereas industrial sources account for most of the rest, 14 percent.
Cigarette smoke is responsible for only 0.1 percent of all benzene emissions, but on
the average, 40 percent of all benzene exposure is direct inhalation by smokers, and
5 percent is exposure to ETS. In comparison, all industrial sources combined are
responsible for less benzene exposure (3 percent) than passive smoking (5 percent).
Figure 61 shows these data (Wallace, 1995).
Even in communities located next to industrial facilities, indoor exposure
dominates. One such study focused on the large petroleum storage and loading
facility at the Alyeska Marine Terminal located just 3 miles from a residential community in Valdez, Alaska. The Marine Terminal accounted for 11 percent of benzene exposure, whereas personal activities such as smoking, driving, consumer
products used in homes, and gasoline vapors in attached garages accounted for the
remaining 89 percent (Yokum, Murray, and Mikkelsen, 1991). Another major study
in northern New Jersey, which has one of the greatest concentrations of oil refineries and chemical plants in the nation, measured exposure to 25 different VOCs. No
difference in exposure was seen between residents near the plants and farther away
(Wallace, 1995).
Cigarettes emit not only benzene but a host of other toxic chemicals including
styrene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, formaldehyde, and 1,3-butadiene. Newly
dry-cleaned clothes emit tetrachloroethylene for days after putting them into your
closet. Moth repellents and spray room air fresheners emit p-dichlorobenzene,
which causes cancer in rats and mice. Hot showers, clothes, and dishwashing are
major sources of airborne chloroform, another carcinogen. Cooking adds polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to indoor air. Pesticides stored in garages and

homes are major sources of many other carcinogens found indoors. Pesticides that
are used outdoors, and lead particles that settled onto the soil, are tracked into
homes on dirt from shoes. All told, TEAM studies of human exposure to 33 VOCs
and pesticides in the United States show that indoor exposures account for about
85 percent of total cancer risk from these chemicals (Figure 62).
Clearly, if we want to reduce the hazards of air pollution, the place to start is
at home. Simple things like using a floor mat, or removing shoes at the entrance, can
reduce the amount of outside pollution that is brought into a home on our shoes.

479

Air Pollution

Dry-cleaning clothes less often, or at least airing them out for a day or two before
putting them in your closet will help. Exhaust fans over ranges can reduce particulate and PAH exposure, and bathroom fans can help clear out chloroform from
chlorinated shower water. Be sure carbon monoxide and other combustion products
formed in water heaters and space heaters are properly vented, and certainly don’t
try to heat a house with a charcoal grill or an unvented kerosene heater. Be sure
paints, cleaning fluids, and other sources of VOCs are sealed properly before storage, and provide plenty of ventilation when you use them. And, if you smoke, do so
outside if at all possible. Simple, no-cost measures such as these can significantly
reduce your exposure to toxic air pollutants.
In the less-developed countries of the world, indoor exposure to hazardous air
pollutants is much more severe. Traditional methods of cooking often involve
“dirty” fuels such as coal, wood, animal dung, charcoal, and kerosene, which are
often burned in homes or cooking huts without chimneys or proper ventilation.
Women and their infant children are often exposed to extremely high concentrations
of particulates and other products of combustion for lengthy periods of time. One
result is elevated levels of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children that a number of studies correlate with indoor exposure to smoke. Acute respiratory infections,
such as pneumonia, are the main cause of childhood deaths worldwide, killing
approximately 4.3 million children per year. That is 30 percent more deaths than are
caused by the number two killer, diarrhea. A number of studies show two to six
times the incidence rate of ARI among children living in homes where cooking is
done on an open biomass stove, compared to those using more modern fuels, such
as LPG, with chimneys. Similar elevated incidence rates for lung cancer have been
observed in urban homes in China that burn coal for cooking or heating compared
with homes that use natural gas (Smith, 1993a). The enormity of the indoor air
quality problem in developing countries is truly staggering.

Infiltration, Ventilation, and Air Quality
Just as with outdoor air, the amount of air available to dilute pollutants is an
important indicator of likely contaminant concentrations. Indoor air can be exchanged with outdoor air by any combination of three mechanisms: infiltration,
natural ventilation, and forced ventilation. Infiltration is the term used to describe
the natural air exchange that occurs between a building and its environment when
doors and windows are closed. That is, it is leakage that occurs through various
cracks and holes that exist in the building envelope. Natural ventilation is the air
exchange that occurs when windows or doors are purposely opened to increase air
circulation, whereas forced ventilation occurs when mechanical air-handling
systems induce air exchange using fans or blowers.
Large amounts of energy are lost when conditioned air (heated or cooled) that
leaks out of buildings is replaced by outside air that must be mechanically heated or
cooled to maintain desired interior temperatures. It is not uncommon, for example,
for one-third of a home’s space heating and cooling energy requirements to be caused
by unwanted leakage of air, that is, infiltration. Nationwide, about 10 percent of
total U.S. energy consumption is accounted for by infiltration, which translates into
tens of billions of dollars worth of wasted energy each year. Since infiltration is quite

480

Air Pollution

easily, and cheaply, controlled, it is not surprising that tightening buildings has
become a popular way to help save energy. Unfortunately, in the process of saving
energy, we may exacerbate indoor air quality problems unless we simultaneously
reduce the sources of pollution.
Air leaks in and out of buildings through numerous cracks and openings in the
building envelope. The obvious cracks around windows and doors are the usual
ones we try to plug with caulk and weatherstripping, but there are many less obvious, but potentially more important, leakage areas such as those created when
plumbing, ducts, and electrical wiring penetrate walls, ceilings, and floors; fireplaces
without dampers; ceiling holes created around recessed light fixtures, attic access
hatches, and any other bypasses created between heated spaces and the attic; gaps
where foundations are connected to walls; exhaust vents in bathrooms and kitchens;
and, perhaps most importantly, leaky ductwork in homes with forced-air heating
systems. Figure 63 shows some of these infiltration sites.
Infiltration is driven by pressure differences between the inside of the building
and the outdoor air. These pressure differences can be caused by wind or by insideto-outside temperature differences. Wind blowing against a building creates higher
pressure on one side of the building than the other, inducing infiltration through
cracks and other openings in the walls. Temperature induced infiltration (usually
referred to as the stack effect) is influenced less by holes in the walls than by various
openings in the floors and ceilings. In the winter, warm air in a building wants to
rise, exiting through breaks in the ceiling and drawing in colder air through floor
openings. Thus, infiltration rates are influenced not only by how fast the wind is
blowing and how great the temperature difference is between inside and outside but

Air Pollution

also by the locations of the leaks in the building envelope. Greater leakage areas in
the floor and ceiling encourage stack-driven infiltration, whereas leakage areas in
vertical surfaces encourage wind-driven infiltration.
Moreover, while it is usually assumed that increasing the infiltration rate will
enhance indoor air quality, that may not be the case in one important circumstance:
for radon that is emitted from the soil under a building. For radon, wind-driven infiltration helps reduce indoor concentrations by allowing radon-free fresh air to blow
into the building. Stack-driven infiltration, which draws air through the floor, may
actually encourage new radon to enter the building, negating the cleaning that infiltration usually causes. Figure 64 illustrates these important differences.
Infiltration rates may be expressed in units such as m3/hr or cubic feet per
minute (cfm), but more often the units are given in air changes per hour (ach). The
air exchange rate in ach is simply the number of times per hour that a volume of air
equal to the volume of space in the house is exchanged with outside air. Typical
average infiltration rates in American homes range from about 0.5 ach to 1 ach, with
newer houses being more likely to have rates at the lower end of the scale while older
homes are closer to the top end. Some very poorly built houses have rates as high as

3–4 ach. Carefully constructed new homes today can quite easily be built to achieve
infiltration rates that are as low as 0.1 ach by using continuous plastic sheet “vapor
barriers” in the walls, along with careful application of foam sealants and caulks to
seal cracks and holes. At such low infiltration rates, moisture and pollutant build-up
can be serious enough to require extra ventilation, and the trick is to get that ventilation without throwing away the heat that the outgoing stale air contains.
One way to get extra ventilation with minimal heat loss is with a mechanical
heat-recovery ventilator (HRV), in which the warm, outgoing stale air transfers
much of its heat to the cold, fresh air being drawn into the house. Another, simpler
and cheaper approach is to provide mechanical ventilation systems that can be used
intermittently in the immediate vicinity of concentrated sources of pollutants.
Exhaust fans in bathrooms and range hoods over gas stoves, for example, can
greatly reduce indoor pollution, and by using them only as necessary, heat losses can
be modest.

An Indoor Air Quality Model
It is quite straightforward to apply the box model concepts developed earlier to the
problem of indoor air quality. The simple model we will use treats the building as a
single, well-mixed box, with sources and sinks for the pollutants in question. If necessary, the simple model can be expanded to include several boxes, each characterized by uniform pollutant concentrations. A two-box model, for example, is
sometimes used for radon estimates, where one box is used to model radon concentrations within the living space of a dwelling, and the other models the air space
beneath the house.
Consider the simple, one-box model of a building shown in Figure 65. There
are sources of pollution within the building that can be characterized by various
emission rates. In addition, ambient air entering the building may bring new sources
of pollution, which adds to whatever may be generated inside. Those pollutants may
be removed from the building by infiltration or ventilation, or they may be nonconservative and decay with time. In addition, if there is a mechanical air-cleaning system, some pollutants may be removed as indoor air is passed through the cleaning
system and returned. To help keep the model simple, we will ignore such mechanical
filtration.

Some of the pollutants that we might want to model, such as CO and NO, can

significant reactivities, and thus K = 0. Equation (64) simplifies considerably for
the basic condition where there is no ambient concentration of the pollutant

EXAMPLE 18 A Portable Kerosene Heater
An unvented, portable, radiant heater, fueled with kerosene is tested under controlled laboratory conditions. After running the heater for two hours in a test
chamber with a 46.0 m3 volume and an infiltration rate of 0.25 ach, the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) reaches 20 ppm. Initial CO in the lab is 0, and
the ambient CO level is negligible throughout the run. Treating CO as a conservative pollutant, find the rate at which the heater emits CO. If the heater were to
be used in a small home to heat 120 m3 of space having 0.4 ach, predict the
steady-state concentration.

Air Pollution

Portable kerosene heaters, such as the one introduced in Example 18, became
quite popular soon after the energy crises of the 1970s, and they continue to be used
indoors, especially in developing countries, despite warning labels. There are two
types of kerosene heaters: radiant heaters, which heat objects in a direct line-of-sight
by radiation heat transfer, and convective heaters that warm up the air, which, in
turn, heats objects in the room by convection. Radiant heaters operate at lower temperatures so their NOx emissions are reduced, but their CO emissions are higher
than the hotter running convective types. Both types of kerosene heaters have high
enough emission rates to cause concern if used in enclosed spaces such as a home or
trailer.
The following example shows how we can estimate the radon concentration in
a home using this simple indoor air pollution model.

EXAMPLE 19 Indoor Radon Concentration
Suppose the soil under a single-story house emits 1.0 pCi/m2-s of radon gas. As a
worst case, assume that all of this gas finds its way through the floor and into the
house. The house has 250 m2 of floor space, an average ceiling height of 2.6 m,
and an air change rate of 0.9 ach. Estimate the steady-state concentration of
radon in the house, assuming the ambient concentration is negligible.
Solution We can find the steady-state concentration using (62) with Ca = 0.
The decay rate of radon is given in Table 14 as K = 7.6 * 10 - 3/hr, which we
could have calculated using (3.8) along with radon’s 3.8-day half-life:
C( q ) =

(S>V)

=

1 pCi/m2s * 3,600 s/hr * 250 m2

b

= 1.5 * 103 pCi/m3 = 1.5 pCi/L
which is fairly typical for homes in the United States.

The specific gravity of the oxygenate ethanol (CH3CH2OH) is 0.791, whereas for pure

The CAFE credit that is provided for natural-gas-powered vehicles is similar to that for

Suppose a 50-mpg hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) is retrofitted with extra batteries, making
it a plug-in hybrid (PHEV). The batteries give the PHEV a 30-mile/day range on electricity, with a grid-to-wheels efficiency of 0.25 kWh/mile. After those 30 miles, the extra
weight of batteries means the car only gets 45 mpg when running on gasoline. The PHEV
is driven 50 round-trip miles per day back and forth to work, 5 days per week. On weekends, it is driven 25 miles per day for errands.
(a) At $3.50 per gallon of gasoline and $0.08/kWh for electricity, what is the cost of fuel
expressed as a ¢/mile average? Compare it to the original HEV.
(b) If the car hadn’t been converted, what would be the annual cost of fuel and how
much would be saved per year by making this a PHEV?
(c) If the conversion costs $3,000, what is the simple payback period for this investment?
How many miles do the batteries have to last to make this worthwhile?

Suppose the 0.25 kWh/mi EV and PHEV in Figure 28 get their electricity from a 60 percentefficient natural-gas-fired combined-cycle (NGCC) power plant delivering electricity
through a 96 percent-efficient grid. Natural gas emits 14.4 gC/MJ and 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ.
(a) Find the gCO2/mile for this EV.
(b) Find the gCO2/mile for this PHEV.
Los Angeles has an average solar radiation equivalent to 5.5 hours per day of full sun hitting a

Assume a 75 percent conversion factor from rated-PV power to AC power delivered to the grid.
Consider a 50 percent-efficient solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) used in a combined heat-andpower (CHP) system. The SOFC converts 50 percent of its natural gas fuel energy into
electricity and 20 percent into useful heat. Compare its overall energy efficiency with a
separate system that provides the same heat and power with 30 percent-efficient grid electricity and an 80 percent efficient boiler.
Compare the carbon emissions for a natural-gas-fired combined heat-and-power (CHP)

that the average heat content of the coal is 10,000 Btu/lb. What must have been the average efficiency (heat to electricity) of these coal plants? How much particulate matter
would have been released if all of the plants met the New Source Performance Standards
that limit particulate emissions to 0.03 lb per 106 Btu of heat?
In this chapter, the following expression was used in the derivation of the dry adiabatic
lapse rate: dQ = Cp dT - V dP (Eq. 37). Derive that expression starting with a statement of the first law of thermodynamics: dQ = dU + dW, where dU = Cv dT is the
change in internal energy when an amount of heat, dQ, is added to the gas, raising its
temperature by dT and causing it to expand and do work dW = P dV. Cv is the specific
heat at constant volume. Then use the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where n is moles (a constant) and R is the gas constant, along with the definition of the derivative of a product,
d(PV) = P dV + V dP, to find another expression for dQ. Finally, using the definition
Cp = (dQ>dT) with the pressure held constant, show that Cp = Cv + nR, and you’re
about there.

A point source Gaussian plume model for a power plant uses 50 m as the effective

ground-level concentration.
A coal-fired power plant with effective stack height of 100 m emits 1.2 g/s of SO2 per
megawatt of power delivered. If winds are assumed to be 4 m/s at that height and just
over 3 m/s at 10 m, how big could the plant be (MW) without having the ground level
SO2 exceed 365 mg/m3? (First decide which stability classification leads to the worst
conditions.)
A 35 percent-efficient coal-fired power plant with effective height of 100 m emits SO2 at

The world’s tallest stack is on a copper smelter in Sudbury, Ontario. It stands 380 m high
and has an inner diameter at the top of 15.2 m. If 130°C gases exit the stack at 20 m/s
while the ambient temperature is 10°C and the winds at stack height are 8 m/s, use the
Briggs model to estimate the effective stack height. Assume a slightly unstable atmosphere, class C.
Repeat Problem 38 for a stable, isothermal atmosphere (no temperature change with
altitude).
A power plant has a 100-m stack with an inside radius of 1 m. The exhaust gases leave the
stack with an exit velocity of 10 m/s at a temperature of 120°C. Ambient temperature is
6°C, winds at the effective stack height are estimated to be 5 m/s, surface windspeed is
3 m/s, and it is a cloudy summer day. Estimate the effective height of this stack.
A 200-MW power plant has a 100-m stack with radius 2.5 m, flue gas exit velocity
13.5 m/s, and gas exit temperature 145°C. Ambient temperature is 15°C, windspeed at
the stack is 5 m/s, and the atmosphere is stable, class E, with a lapse rate of 5°C/km. If it
emits 300 g/s of SO2, estimate the concentration at ground level at a distance of 16 km
directly downwind.
A source emits 20 g/s of some pollutant from a stack with effective height 50 m in winds
that average 5 m/s. On a single graph, sketch the downwind concentration for stability
classifications A, C, and F, using Figure 52 to identify the peak concentration and
distance.
A source emits 20 g/s of some pollutant in winds that average 5 m/s, on a class C day. Use
Figure 52 to find the peak concentrations for effective stack heights of 50, 100, and
200 m. Note whether the concentration is roughly proportional to (1>H2), as Problem 37
suggests.
A paper plant is being proposed for a location 1 km upwind from a town. It will emit
40 g/s of hydrogen sulfide, which has an odor threshold of about 0.1 mg/m3. Winds at
the stack may vary from 4 to 10 m/s blowing toward the town. What minimum stack
height should be used to assure concentrations are nor more than 0.1 times the odor
threshold at the near edge of town on a class B day? To be conservative, the stack will be
designed assuming no plume rise. If the town extends beyond the 1-km distance, will any
buildings experience higher concentrations than a residence at the boundary under these
conditions?
A stack with effective height of 45 m emits SO2 at the rate of 150 g/s. Winds are estimated

A freeway has 10,000 vehicles per hour passing a house 200 m away. Each car emits an

Consider an area-source box model for air pollution above a peninsula of land (see
Figure P49). The length of the box is 15 km, its width is 80 km, and a radiation inversion

(c) If the windspeed is 0, use (58) to derive a relationship between CO and time and use
it to find the CO over the peninsula at 6 PM.
Consider a box model for an air shed over a city 1 * 105 m on a side, with a mixing
depth of 1,200 m. Winds with no SO2 blow at 4 m/s against one side of the box. SO2 is
emitted in the box at the rate of 20 kg/s. If SO2 is considered to be conservative, estimate
the steady-state concentration in the air shed.
With the same air shed and ambient conditions as given in Problem 50, assume that the
emissions occur only on weekdays. If emissions stop at 5 PM on Friday, estimate the SO2
concentration at midnight. If they start again on Monday at 8 AM, what would the concentration be by 5 PM.

Consider use of a tracer gas to determine the air exchange rate in a room. By injecting a
stable gas into the room and then monitoring the decay in concentration with time, we
can estimate I (ach). The governing equation is
C = C0e - nt

Global Atmospheric Change

1 Introduction
The preceding four quotes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) demonstrate a cautious evolution in the degree of certainty expressed by
climate scientists about the role played by human activities in causing the past halfcentury’s rapid rise in global average temperature. The Time magazine cover story
in April 2006, with the provocative title “Be Worried. Be Very Worried” well captured the growing awareness among the general public that dealing with global
warming is perhaps the most important environmental challenge of the twenty-first
century.
While the atmosphere is made up almost entirely of nitrogen and oxygen,
other gases and particles existing in very small concentrations determine to a large
extent the habitability of our planet. In this chapter, we will focus on several of these
other gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4),
and ozone (O3), as well as a category of man-made gases called halocarbons that includes chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), methylchloroform (CH3CCl3),
and halons. The two problems of greenhouse effect enhancement, leading to global
climate change, and stratospheric ozone depletion, which increases our exposure to
life-threatening ultraviolet radiation, are linked to changes in these trace gases and
are the subject of this chapter.
The problems of global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion are linked
by their shared dependence on minute changes in our global atmosphere, and they
are, by their very nature, problems whose solutions require international cooperation. The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to (1) assess available scientific information on climate change, (2) assess the environmental and
socioeconomic impacts of climate change, and (3) formulate appropriate response
strategies (IPPC, 1995). The IPCC provided the technical documentation that
led to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),
which was signed by 150 nations, including the United States, at the UN
Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The
UNFCCC is a climate treaty that laid the groundwork for nations to stabilize
greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. It took effect on March 21, 1994, after
50 countries ratified the treaty. The subsequent Kyoto Protocol had its origins in
UNFCCC.
Another effort by WMO and UNEP to organize the scientific community
around the issue of stratospheric ozone depletion led to the signing of the Montreal
Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer in 1987. The Montreal
Protocol, and subsequent Amendments framed in London (1990), Copenhagen
(1992), and Vienna (1995), has been extraordinarily important both in terms of its
success in reducing emissions of ozone depleting substances and its clear demonstration that nations can come together to address global environmental problems.
Much of this chapter is based on the multivolume scientific assessment reports
on climate change and ozone depletion that have been written as part of the WMO
and UNEP efforts.

Global Atmospheric Change

2 The Atmosphere of Earth
When the Earth was formed, some 4.6 billion years ago, it probably had an atmosphere made up of helium and compounds of hydrogen such as molecular hydrogen, methane, and ammonia. That early atmosphere is thought to have escaped
into space, after which our current atmosphere slowly began to form. Through
volcanic activity, gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and various compounds of nitrogen and sulfur were released over time. Molecular oxygen (O2)
eventually began to form both as a result of photodissociation of water vapor and
by photosynthesis by plants that were evolving underwater where life was protected from the sun’s intense, biologically damaging ultraviolet radiation. As atmospheric oxygen levels gradually increased, more and more ozone (O3) was formed
in the atmosphere. It is thought that the absorption of incoming ultraviolet radiation by that ozone provided the protection necessary for life to begin to emerge
onto the land.
Table 1 shows the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere as it exists now,
expressed in volumetric fractions. The values given are for “clean,” dry, air and
don’t include the relatively small but extremely important amounts of water vapor
and particulate matter. While most of the values in the table are essentially unchanging, that is not the case for the principal greenhouse gases carbon dioxide
CO2, methane CH4, and nitrous oxide N2O, which are rising.
It is convenient to think of the atmosphere as being divided into various horizontal layers, each characterized by the slope of its temperature profile. Starting at
the Earth’s surface, these layers are called the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere,
and thermosphere. The troposphere and mesosphere are characterized by decreasing
temperatures with altitude, while the stratosphere and thermosphere show increasing temperatures. The transition altitudes separating these layers are called the

tropopause, stratopause, and mesopause. Obviously, the conditions in the actual
atmosphere of Earth vary with time and location, but a useful, idealized temperature
profile, known as the U.S. Standard Atmosphere, provides a convenient starting
point for atmospheric studies (Figure 1).
More than 80 percent of the mass of the atmosphere and virtually all of the
water vapor, clouds, and precipitation occur in the troposphere. At mid-latitudes, the
troposphere extends up to 10 or 12 km (about the altitude of a typical commercial airline flight). At the poles, it may be only about 5 to 6 km, while at the equator it is about
18 km. In the troposphere, temperatures typically decrease at 5 to 7°C per km, which
is essentially the wet adiabatic lapse rate corresponding to the rate of change of temperature as water-saturated air rises. The troposphere is usually a very turbulent place;
that is, strong vertical air movements lead to rapid and complete mixing. This mixing
is good for air quality since it rapidly disperses pollutants.
Above the troposphere is a stable layer of very dry air called the stratosphere.
Pollutants that find their way into the stratosphere may remain there for many years
before they eventually drift back into the troposphere, where they can be more easily
diluted and ultimately removed by settling or precipitation. In the stratosphere, shortwavelength ultraviolet energy is absorbed by ozone (O3) and oxygen (O2), causing the
air to be heated. The resulting temperature inversion is what causes the stratosphere to
be so stable. The troposphere and stratosphere combined account for about 99.9 percent of the mass of the atmosphere. Together they extend only about 50 km above the
surface of the Earth, a distance equal to less than 1 percent of the Earth’s radius.
Beyond the stratosphere lies the mesosphere, another layer where air mixes
fairly readily, and above that the thermosphere. The heating of the thermosphere is
due to the absorption of solar energy by atomic oxygen. Within the thermosphere is
a relatively dense band of charged particles, called the ionosphere. (Before satellites,
the ionosphere was especially important to worldwide communications because of
its ability to reflect radio waves back to Earth.)

Global Atmospheric Change

3 Global Temperature
The common definition of climate suggests it is the prevailing or average weather of a
place as determined by temperature and other meteorological conditions over a period
of years. Average temperature, then, is but one measure of climate; many others, including precipitation, winds, glaciation, and frequency of extreme events such as typhoons
and hurricanes, are also important parameters. Long-term variations in average temperature, however, are the single most important attribute of climate change.
Climatologists have used a number of clues to piece together past global temperatures, including evidence gathered from historical documents, tree rings,
changes in ice volume and sea level, fossil pollen analysis, and geologic observations
related to glacial movements. One of the most fruitful approaches involves the
analysis of concentrations of various stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen as
found in ice cores and sea-floor sediments.

Isotopes and Temperature
Recall that atoms of a particular element all have the same number of protons but
may have varying numbers of neutrons. The sum of the protons and neutrons, called
the mass number, identifies which isotope of that element we are talking about. Some
isotopes are radioactive, such as radon-222 (222Rn), and their decay rate can be used
to date various geological events. Other isotopes are stable, which means they can be
used to track the movement of substances in the environment over geologic time.
Consider water, H2O. Hydrogen, with one proton, has two stable isotopes, 1H
2
and H (also called deuterium, D). Oxygen, with eight protons, has three stable isotopes, 16O, 17O, and 18O. Thus we can imagine many different combinations of
atoms making up molecules of water, including the two most important “heavier
water” molecules 1H2H16O and 1H1H18O.
When water evaporates from the oceans, it contains a mix of isotopes of
hydrogen and oxygen. Heavier water containing 18O or deuterium (2H) evaporates less
readily and condenses more quickly than light water, which means those heavy isotopes get left behind as water vapor from the ocean travels toward the poles. That
means snow falling in the Arctic and Antarctic will have lower concentrations of deuterium (D or 2H) and 18O than seawater. This separation of light isotopes from heavier
ones is temperature dependent. As it gets colder, less and less of the heavier deuterium
and 18O make it to the poles. The 2H> 1H and 18O> 16O ratios in precipitation that
forms glaciers and ice sheets therefore decrease when it gets colder and increase when
it gets warmer, thus providing a very important historic measure of global temperature.
The relative abundance of 2H and 18O in seawater is so important that standardized concentrations have been established called the Vienna Standard Mean
Ocean Water (VSMOW) ratios. The VSMOW ratio of 2H> 1H is 0.00015575 (1 deuterium per 6,422 atoms of conventional hydrogen) and the standardized 18O> 16O
ratio is 0.0020052 (1 part 18O to 499 parts 16O). The shifts in isotope ratios are compared to the standard using a parts-per-thousand dX(0 > 00) notation. For example, the
d18O(0 > 00) concentration is expressed as
d18O(0 > 00) = c

(18O> 16O) sample
(18O> 16O) standard

- 1 d * 103

(1)

505

Global Atmospheric Change

Negative values of d18O or dD represent isotope ratios below the standard,
while positive numbers correspond to higher ratios. For example, d18O(0 > 00) = - 10
means the concentration of 18O is lower than the standard by 10 parts per thousand
(“10 per mil”), or 1 percent. Changes in dD and d18O in precipitation seem to be linearly related to temperature. For d18O, the change is about 0.7 per °C, while for deuterium, it is about 6 per mil per °C (McGuffie and Henderson-Sellers, 2005).
EXAMPLE 1 Deuterium in an Ice Core
Suppose a deuterium measurement taken near the surface of an ice core yields an
isotope ratio of 2H> 1H = 8.753 * 10 - 5.
a. Find the corresponding dD(0 > 00) using the VSMOW standard for deuterium.
b. Suppose an ice sample from a deeper, and older, depth in the core shows
dD(0 > 00) = - 445. Using the estimate of 5.6 dD(0 > 00) per °C, how much
colder was it at the time that ice layer was created?
Solution
a. Using the VSMOW standard of 0.00015575 for deuterium in (1) gives
(2H> 1H) sample

dD(0 > 00) = c

(2H> 1H) standard

- 1 d * 103

dD(0 > 00) = c

8.753 * 10 - 5
- 1 d * 103 = - 438
0.00015575

b. The 7 per mil drop in dD from - 438 to -445 translates to about 7>5.6 *
1°C = 1.25°C colder than the present.
As the world’s ice volume increases, it selectively removes 16O from the hydrologic cycle and concentrates the remaining 18O in the decreasing volume of the
oceans. Hence, marine organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbonate in
seawater will have a higher ratio of 18O to 16O in their shells when it is cold and
more of the world’s water is locked up in glaciers and ice. By dating marine sediments extracted from deep sea cores, and observing the ratio of the two oxygen isotopes in their carbonates, a historic record of the volume of ice storage on Earth can
be created. Figure 2 shows a reconstruction of climate based on d18O in benthic

carbonates over the past 5 million years. The temperature scale calibration is based
on a comparison with ice core data. Notice the isotope record in ocean sediments
moves in the opposite direction to the isotope record in glacial ice. That is, for
example, while warmer temperatures cause decreases in 18O in oceans and sediments, warmer temperatures cause increases in 18O in that year’s layer of glacial ice.

The Antarctic and Greenland Ice Cores
Analysis of ice cores taken in Greenland and Antarctica have provided a remarkable
picture of the climate and composition of the Earth’s atmosphere over hundreds of
thousands of years of history. Isotopic analysis of glacial ice provides the temperature record, while analysis of the composition of the air bubbles captured in the ice
as it was formed gives a corresponding record of the concentrations of various
atmospheric gases as well as wind-blown dust and ash.
The Vostok station in Antarctica is the site from which a number of significant
cores have been drilled, the deepest of which extends 3,623-meters into the ice. The
Vostok core provides a climate record that extends back some 420,000 years and
includes four past glacial cycles. The record-holding ice core in terms of the length
of its historical record, as opposed to its depth, is the 3,270-m European Project for
Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) core drilled into an ice summit called Dome C
located several hundred miles away from Vostok. The EPICA core goes back in time
by more than 720,000 years and covers 8 previous glacial cycles.
Figure 3 shows a very strong correlation between atmospheric carbon dioxide
and methane concentrations taken from air bubbles in the Antarctic cores compared

with the dD temperature surrogate. During glacial periods, the greenhouse gases CO2
and CH4 are low; during the warmer interglacial periods, they are high. Perhaps the
most startling feature in the figure is how much higher the current CO2 concentration is (390 ppm in 2007) than it has been in over 650,000 years. What the data do
not make clear is whether it is changing concentrations of greenhouse gases that
cause temperature changes or vice versa. Switches from glacial to interglacial periods
may well be triggered by other phenomena, such as natural variations in the Earth’s
orbit, coupled with positive feedbacks between warming and increased greenhouse
gas emissions.
In the opposite hemisphere, a number of cores have been drilled into the the
3-km-thick glacial cap in Greenland. The Greenland data show cycles of gradual
cooling, followed by rapid warming, during the last glacial period. These cycles,
which have a period of between 500 and 2,000 years, are called DansgaardOeschger events after their discoverers. They seem to be linked to another phenomenon, called Heinrich events, in which it is thought that enormous flotillas of
icebergs periodically drifted across the North Atlantic; their melting deposited
unusual layers of sediments on the seafloor that were used to identify and date these
events. One of the most startling observations from Greenland ice cores is the speed
with which large, regional temperature jumps can occur. During the last glacial
period, 10,000 to 110,000 years ago, the temperature of Greenland showed jumps
of 5 to 7°C within just a decade or two. Global temperatures, on the other hand, do
not seem to have changed nearly that rapidly in the past. Over the past 10,000 years
(the present interglacial period), it seems unlikely that global mean temperatures
have ever changed faster than 1°C per century (IPCC, 1995, 3.6.3).

More Recent Global Temperature
While ice cores and seafloor sediments provide indirect methods of estimating temperatures over many hundreds of thousands of years of Earth history, ever since the
mid-nineteenth century, the temperature record has been based on actual measurements. Most of the data are from actual thermometer readings taken at weather stations across the globe, including ships at sea, augmented more recently with satellite
data. Adjustments have been made to discount the impact of warming caused by the
growth of cities around meteorological stations. Dark surfaces in urban areas
absorbing heat from the sun, along with waste heat from energy consumption, cause
elevated temperatures referred to as the urban heat island effect. To offset the bias
caused by urban warming, nighttime satellite images are used to identify stations
outside of brightly lit urban areas. Greater reliance is then placed on data sets taken
from those unlit areas and other rural areas across the globe. After these adjustments, the remaining urban influence on the global record is estimated to be less
than 0.1°C (Hansen et al., 2001).
Figure 4 shows the Goddard Institute for Space Sciences (GISS) estimate of
the mean annual global temperature expressed as a deviation, or anomaly, from a
fixed reference temperature. In this graph, the reference is the 1951–1980 average
global temperature, estimated to be 14°C. Eleven of the years between 1995 and
2006 rank among the 12 warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface
temperature (IPCC, 2007). The current average temperature is probably the highest
it has been since the beginning of the current interglacial period, which began some

12,000 years ago. While the overall temperature trend has been steeply upward, the
period between about 1940 and 1980 shows an actual decline in temperature. That
cooling is attributed to particulates, especially sulfates, caused by rapidly growing
fossil fuel combustion during a period of time when emission controls were not yet
in widespread use. Those aerosols reflecting sunlight back into space are thought to
have masked the ongoing global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions.
When power plant emissions began to be controlled, global warming reemerged and
the post-1980 temperature increases have averaged about 0.28°C per decade. The
more recent 1992–1994 cool spell is attributed to the increased reflection of sunlight
off the atmosphere caused by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, in
June 1991.
Attempts have been made to combine the measured temperature anomaly with
other temperature proxies such as historical documents, tree rings, corals, ice cores,
and lake sediments to reconstruct patterns of the past thousand or so years of temperature change. These attempts focus on the Northern Hemisphere mean temperature since there isn’t much data available for the rest of the globe. One such study is
shown in Figure 5. Several periods of time are sometimes noted, including a
“Medieval Warm Period” from roughly 900 to 1300, during which some regions of
the globe experienced unusual warmth, and the “Little Ice Age” from about 1500 to
1900, when the opposite occurred.
The overall shape of the 1,000-year profile shown in Figure 5 has picked up
the nickname of the temperature “hockey stick.” The hockey stick has been a source
of some controversy, with some arguing that the current temperature and rate of
change of temperature might not be without precedent in the past 1,000 years, and
therefore the warming we are now observing may be a natural phenomenon. The

data set from which the graph has been drawn has enough uncertainty in it to keep
this controversy alive, but the National Research Council took up the issue in 2006
and concluded that there is a high level of confidence that the global mean surface
temperature during the past few decades is higher than at any time over the preceding four centuries, but beyond that there is less confidence. Whether or not the
warming is unprecedented, the current rapid increase in anthropogenic greenhouse
gas emissions, the well understood physics and chemistry of the atmosphere, and
direct measurements of greenhouse gas impacts, all tell us the climate is changing,
and we have a lot to do with causing that change.

Orbital Variations and Sunspots
The history and future of the Earth’s orbit around the sun can be calculated
precisely. The connection between orbital variations and climate were first proposed
in the 1930s by an astronomer, Milutin Milankovitch, and the orbital cycles are
now referred to as Milankovitch oscillations. Changes in the orbit affect the amount
of sunlight striking the Earth as well as the distribution of sunlight both geographically and seasonally. Those variations are thought to be quite influential in the timing of the coming and going of ice ages and interglacial periods.
There are three primary orbital cycles. The shape of the Earth’s orbit oscillates
from elliptical to more nearly circular with a period of 100,000 years (eccentricity).
The Earth’s tilt angle with respect to its orbit fluctuates from 21.5° to 24.5° with a
period of 41,000 years (obliquity). Finally, there is a 23,000-year period associated

with the precession, or wobble, of the Earth’s spin axis (precession). This precession
determines where in the Earth’s orbit a given hemisphere’s summer occurs. Figure 6
illustrates these variations.
Careful analysis of the historical record of global temperatures does show a
primary cycle between glacial episodes of about 100,000 years, mixed with secondary oscillations with periods of 23,000 years and 41,000 years that match the
Milankovitch theory reasonably well. Although these orbital variations only change
the total annual dosage of sunlight by about 0.1 percent, the impacts on seasons and
the resulting patterns of oceanic and atmospheric heat distribution around the globe
are thought to be significant enough to trigger major climate changes.
Another factor that affects the amount of solar radiation reaching the top of
the Earth’s atmosphere is variations in the intensity of radiation emitted from the
sun itself. For example, the sun spins on its axis making one complete rotation every
27 days. There are darker and brighter areas on the solar surface that cause variations of up to 0.2 percent in the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth over
that 27-day period. Those variations occur so rapidly, however, that they are not
thought to be particularly important in determining average global climate.
Of greater importance is an 11-year cycle of sunspots that were first described
by an amateur astronomer, Heinrich Schwabe, in 1843 (Figure 7). During peak
periods of magnetic activity on the sun, the surface has large numbers of cooler,
darker regions, called sunspots, that in essence block solar radiation, accompanied
by other regions, called faculae, that are brighter than the surrounding surface. The

net effect of sunspots that dim the sun, and faculae that brighten it, is an increase in
solar intensity during periods of increased numbers of sunspots. The variation in
solar radiation reaching the Earth as a result of these cycles is roughly 0.1 percent,
which is thought to be enough to change the Earth’s temperature by roughly 0.2°C.
Sunspot activity helps provide an explanation for the continuous up and down jiggling of the Earth’s temperature that complicates the problem of deciding whether a
true global warming “signal” is emerging from the “noise.”

A Simple Global Temperature Model
Measurements of historical global temperatures show that our planet has maintained its average temperature within a limited range, but within those bounds, it
seems to be continuously changing. If we hope to predict future impacts of anthropogenic changes in our environment, we need to develop mathematical models that
explain the past. Mathematically modeling of global climate and predicting the impacts of changes in key environmental parameters is an extremely important but difficult task. Such models range from very simple back-of-the-envelope calculations,
to complex, three-dimensional General Circulation Models (GCMs, also known as
Global Climate Models) that attempt to predict climate on a regional, seasonal, and
annual basis. The most sophisticated of these models can take weeks to run on a
supercomputer, yet they must still be considered primitive. In comparison, our treatment here is just the briefest of introductions. For a much more thorough introduction, see McGuffie and Henderson-Sellers (2005).
The simplest starting point for modeling climate begins with models that focus
on factors influencing the single parameter, temperature. Obviously, other factors

such as precipitation patterns, winds and storms, ocean currents, soil moisture, sea
ice, glacial cover, and so forth are exceedingly important, but they are more difficult
to approach with simple models. Even beginning with just temperature as the single
quantity of interest, we could try to find out how temperature varies in all four
dimensions (latitude, longitude, altitude, time), which is the domain of very complex
GCMs. At the other end of the complexity scale is a simple “zero-dimensional”
model in which a single average global temperature is obtained that is not a function
of location or time. The following is such a model.
The basic zero-dimensional energy balance model equates solar energy
absorbed by the Earth with the energy that the Earth radiates back to space. Radiation
from the sun arrives just outside the Earth’s atmosphere with an average annual
intensity, called the solar constant, S, currently equal to about 1,370 watts/m2. A simple way to calculate the total rate at which energy hits the Earth is to note that all of
the flux passing through a “hoop” having radius equal to that of the Earth, and
placed normal to the incoming radiation, strikes the Earth’s surface. From Figure 8,
we can write
Rate at which solar energy strikes the Earth = SpR2 (watts)

(2)

where
S = the solar constant, taken to be 1,370 W/m2
R = the radius of the Earth (m)
Some of the incoming solar energy that hits the Earth is reflected back into
space, as shown in Figure 9. Such reflected energy is not absorbed by the Earth or its
atmosphere and does not contribute to their heating. The fraction of incoming solar
radiation that is reflected is called the albedo, and for the Earth, the global annual
mean value is now estimated to be about 31 percent. What isn’t reflected is
absorbed, which leads to the following expressions.
Energy reflected by Earth = SpR2a
Energy absorbed by Earth = SpR2(1 - a)

(3)
(4)

where a = the Earth’s albedo, taken to be 0.31.
On the other side of the energy balance equation is the rate at which Earth
sends energy back to space. Since there can be no heat transfer from the Earth to

space by conduction or convection, the only way for the Earth to get rid of energy is
by radiation. Every object radiates energy at a rate that is proportional to its surface
area times its absolute temperature raised to the fourth power. For this model, we
will assume the Earth is a blackbody; that is, it radiates as much as any object with
the same temperature and area possibly can (emissivity = 1). We also assume it is
isothermal; that is, the temperature is the same everywhere on the planet. Since the
area of a spherical object is 4pR2, we can write
Energy radiated back to space by earth = s4pR2T e4

(5)

where
s = Stefan-Boltzmann constant = 5.67 * 10 - 8 W/m2-K4
and
Te = earth’s “effective” blackbody temperature (kelvins)
If we go on to assume steady-state conditions, that is, the Earth’s temperature is not
changing with time, we can equate the rate at which energy from the sun is absorbed
(4), with the rate at which energy is radiated from Earth back to space (5):
SpR2(1 - a) = s4pR2T e4

Notice the conversion from kelvins to Celsius (°C = K - 273). The actual value of
the Earth’s average surface temperature is currently about 288 K (15°C). While we
are off by only 12 percent, which might seem a modest error, in terms of life on
Earth, the 254 K (-19°C) estimate for Te is terribly wrong. We need to find an

514

Global Atmospheric Change

explanation for why the Earth is (fortunately) not that cold. The key factor that
makes our model differ so much from reality is that it does not account for interactions between the atmosphere and the radiation that is emitted from the Earth’s surface. That is, it does not include the greenhouse effect.

4 The Greenhouse Effect
The surface of the Earth is 34°C higher than what is predicted by (8). Wien’s displacement rule gives the wavelength at which a blackbody spectrum peaks as a function of its absolute temperature:
l max (mm) =

2,898
T(K)

(9)

The sun can be represented as a blackbody with temperature 5,800 K, so its
spectrum peaks at 0.5 mm. The Earth, at 288 K, has its peak at 10.1 mm. Figure 10
shows these two spectra. The area under these curves, between any two wavelengths,
is the total radiant energy in that range of frequencies. For example, the area under
the curve of incoming solar radiation just outside the atmosphere is the total solar
radiant flux; that is, it is the solar constant, 1,370 W/m2. Notice nearly all the incoming solar energy as it arrives just outside the Earth’s atmosphere has wavelengths less
than 3 mm, while the outgoing energy radiated by the Earth has essentially all of its
energy in wavelengths greater than 3 mm. With so little overlap, it is convenient to
speak of solar energy as being short-wavelength radiation, while energy radiated
from the Earth’s surface is long-wavelength, or thermal, radiation. The infrared (IR)
portion of the spectrum begins at about 0.7 mm and extends out to 100 mm, so some
of the incoming solar radiation and all of the outgoing thermal radiation is IR.

FIGURE 11 Some IR radiated from the Earth’s surface passes through a relatively clear IR
window between about 7 and 13 mm (a). Most, however, is absorbed by greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere (b).

As radiant energy attempts to pass through the atmosphere, it is affected by
various gases and aerosols in the air. Those atmospheric constituents can let the
radiant energy pass through unaffected, they can scatter the energy by reflection, or
they can stop it by absorption. The key phenomenon of interest here is the ability of
gases to absorb radiant energy. As the atoms in gaseous molecules vibrate toward
and away from each other (vibrational energy) or rotate around each other (rotational energy), they absorb and radiate energy in specific wavelengths. When the frequency of these molecular oscillations is close to the frequency of the passing
radiant energy, the molecule can absorb that energy. This absorption occurs over a
rather limited range of frequencies, not just at the oscillatory frequency of the molecule, and results in an absorptivity spectrum, which is a plot of the fraction of incoming radiant energy that is absorbed as a function of wavelength.
Figure 11a shows the absorption spectra for the key greenhouse gases of concern in this chapter, along with the their effect on outgoing infrared (IR) radiation
emitted by the Earth’s surface. Most of the long-wavelength energy radiated by the
Earth is absorbed by a combination of radiatively active gases, most important of
which are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide
(N2O), and ozone (O3). Water vapor, which is by far the most important greenhouse
gas, strongly absorbs thermal radiation with wavelengths less than 8 mm and greater
than 18 mm. Carbon dioxide shows a strong absorption band centered at 15 mm, as
well as bands centered at 2.7 mm and 4.3 mm. Between 7 mm and 13 mm there is a
relatively clear sky for outgoing thermal radiation, referred to as the atmospheric
radiative window. Radiation in those wavelengths easily passes through the atmosphere, except for a small, but important, absorption band between 9.5 mm and
10.6 mm associated with O3.
Radiatively active gases that absorb wavelengths longer than 4 mm are called
greenhouse gases. This absorption heats the atmosphere, which, in turn, radiates
energy back to the Earth as well as out to space, as shown in Figure 11b. These greenhouse gases act as a thermal blanket around the globe, raising the Earth’s surface
temperature beyond the equivalent temperature calculated earlier. The importance of

water vapor as a greenhouse gas is quite evident on clear nights, when the Earth cools
much more rapidly than it does on cloudy nights. It is also interesting to note that the
term greenhouse effect is based on the concept of a conventional greenhouse with
glass acting much like the aforementioned gases. Glass, which easily transmits shortwavelength solar energy into the greenhouse, absorbs almost all of the longer wavelengths radiated by the greenhouse interior. This radiation trapping is partly
responsible for the elevated temperatures inside the greenhouse, although much of
the effect is simply due to the reduction in convective cooling of the interior space
caused by the enclosure. The elevated interior temperature of your car after it has
been parked in the sun is another common example of the greenhouse effect.
If the Earth did not already have a greenhouse effect, its temperature would be
254 K as predicted by (8). That is, the planet would have an average temperature of
-19°C, or about -2°F. In fact, one way to quantify the magnitude of the greenhouse effect is to compare the effective temperature, Te, given in (7), with the actual
surface temperature, Ts
Magnitude of greenhouse effect = Ts - Te

(10)

Thus, since the actual temperature of the Earth is 288 K, and its effective temperature is 254 K, we can say that the greenhouse effect adds 34°C of warming to the
surface of the Earth.
In Table 2, this notion is applied to Venus and Mars. Even though the
atmosphere of Mars is almost entirely carbon dioxide, there is so little atmosphere
that the greenhouse effect is barely apparent. The atmospheric pressure on Venus,
on the other hand, is nearly 100 times that of Earth, and its atmosphere is 97 percent CO2. The greenhouse effect on Venus is correspondingly very pronounced. It is
interesting to note that without the greenhouse effect, the greater albedo of Venus
would make it cooler than the Earth in spite of its closer proximity to the Sun.

5 Global Energy Balance
As suggested in Figure 11, a simple model of the greenhouse effect treats the Earth’s
surface, the atmosphere, and outer space as three separate regions. Figure 12
expands the diagram to include incoming solar energy as well as outgoing IR and

adds some quantitative detail to help us track energy flows. Some of this detail is relatively easy to derive. Begin by normalizing energy flows between these three regions
by expressing them in terms of rates per unit of surface area of the Earth. For example, (2) indicates that the total amount of solar radiation striking the Earth is SpR2.

Of this 107 W/m2, it is estimated that 77 W/m2 is reflected off the atmosphere itself,
while the remaining 30 W/m2 is reflected off the Earth’s surface. The solar radiation
that is not reflected is absorbed by the Earth and its atmosphere. Calling that

(13)

= 342 W/m2 * (1 - 0.31) = 235 W/m2
Of that 235 W/m2, 67 W/m2 is absorbed by the atmosphere, and the remaining
168 W/m2 is absorbed by the surface of the Earth.
If we assume that global temperatures are unchanging with time, then the rate
at which the Earth and its atmosphere receive energy from space must equal the rate
at which energy is being returned to space. The 107 W/m2 of reflected energy is already balanced; that is, 107 W/m2 hits the Earth/atmosphere, and 107 W/m2 is
reflected back into space so we can ignore that component for now. The Earth and its
atmosphere absorb the remaining 235 W/m2, so the same amount must be radiated
back into space. If the Earth’s surface were at 254 K, it would radiate 235 W/m2,
which is just enough to balance the incoming energy. We know, however, that greenhouse gases would absorb most of that outgoing 235 W/m2, so the required energy
balance would not be realized. Therefore, to force enough energy through the atmosphere to create the necessary balance, the temperature of the Earth’s surface must
be higher than 254 K.
If we treat the Earth as a blackbody radiator, we can use (4) to estimate the
rate at which energy is radiated from the Earth’s surface toward the atmosphere.
With the surface of the Earth at its actual temperature of 288 K, it will radiate the
following amount per unit of surface area.

= 5.67 * 10 - 8 W/m2K4 * (288 K)4 = 390 W/m2
Of that 390 W/m2, only 40 W/m2 passes directly through the atmosphere, mostly
through the atmospheric radiative window between 7 and 13 mm. The remaining
350 W/m2 is absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The atmosphere then
radiates 324 W/m2 back to the surface.
There is also heat transfer from the surface to the atmosphere by convective
heating, evaporation, and condensation of water. Convection transfers 24 W/m2 to
the atmosphere, while condensation of water vapor provides 78 W/m2 of latent heat.
All of these energy flows are shown in Figure 12. If this model is an internally
self-consistent equilibrium model, the rate of energy gain should equal the rate of
energy loss in each of the three regions: space, the atmosphere, and the Earth’s surface. Consider the following checks:
Earth’s surface:

6 Carbon Dioxide: The Principal Greenhouse Gas
Thus far, the greenhouse effect has been described as a natural phenomenon that is
responsible for Earth having an average surface temperature 34°C warmer (288 K vs
254 K) than it would have if it didn’t have radiatively active gases in the atmosphere. As is now well known, anthropogenic sources of a number of gases and
aerosols are enhancing the natural greenhouse effect, leading us into a future of uncertain global climate. The principal greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane,
nitrous oxide, and a category of carbon-based gases called halocarbons, which are
molecules that contain atoms of carbon plus fluorine, chlorine, and/or bromine. In
addition, emissions of black carbon, or soot, particles also add to atmospheric
warming. We begin our exploration of these gases and particulates with the most
important one, carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide has been recognized for its importance as a greenhouse gas for over a century. The Swedish chemist Svante August
Arrhenius is usually credited with the first calculations on global temperature as a
function of atmospheric CO2 content, and his results are not that far from those
obtained today.

Atmospheric Concentration of CO2
The first continuous, precise, and direct measurements of atmospheric carbon
dioxide began in 1957 at the South Pole, and 1958 at Mauna Loa, Hawaii. At that
time, the concentration in Mauna Loa was 315 ppm and growing at less than 1 ppm
per year. In 1979, NOAA began assembling data from a network of sites to determine a global average value. The global average in 1990 was 354 ppm and growing
at 1.6 ppm per year. In 2006, it reached 380 ppm, and the rate of growth had increased to about 2 ppm/yr.
Figure 13 shows NOAA data for monthly global CO2 for the recent past. The
oscillations are caused by seasonal variations in the rates of photosynthesis and respiration. During photosynthesis, carbon is transferred from the air into plant material (indicated by the carbohydrate, glucose, in the following reaction). During
spring and summer, when plants are growing their fastest, atmospheric CO2 levels
drop, tending to reach their lowest point in the Northern Hemisphere in about
October.
Photosynthesis:

6 CO2 + 6 H2O

sunlight, chlorophyll"

C6H12O6 + 6 O2

(15)

Reversing the preceding reaction yields the equation describing respiration, which is
the process that living things use to obtain energy. During respiration, complex organic molecules are broken down, returning carbon to the atmosphere. When the
rate of respiration exceeds the rate of photosynthesis, as tends to occur in the fall
and winter seasons, there is a net replacement of carbon into the atmosphere, which
globally results in peak concentrations around May.
Respiration: 6 C6H12O6 + 6 O2 : 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + energy

(16)

Carbon thus moves continually from the atmosphere into the food chain during photosynthesis and returns to the atmosphere during respiration.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations inferred from Antarctic ice cores
and other evidence over the past 1,000 years, combined with more recent direct
measurements, are shown in Figure 14. Over most of that time period, the concentration of carbon dioxide hovered at close to 280 ppm, and that is the value that is
commonly used as a reference point for comparison with current readings and
future projections. Carbon dioxide concentrations are now more than one-third
higher than they were just before the industrial revolution.

The Carbon Cycle
The atmosphere contains about 800 GtC, where 1 GtC means 1 gigaton of carbon
(109 metric tons or 1015 g). Since almost all of that carbon is stored in the form of
CO2 (less than 1 percent is in other carbon-containing compounds such as methane
and carbon monoxide), in most circumstances it is reasonable to assume that
atmospheric carbon is entirely CO2. The amount of carbon locked up in terrestrial
vegetation (610 GtC) is of the same order of magnitude as that in the atmosphere,
but both of these amounts are dwarfed by the 39,000 GtC stored in the oceans.
Natural processes continuously transport enormous amounts of carbon back
and forth among the atmosphere, biosphere, and the oceans. The carbon flux into
and out of the atmosphere during photosynthesis and respiration is on the order of
60 GtC/yr. The oceans absorb around 90 Gt/C/yr and store almost all of it in the

form of bicarbonate ions (HCO3- ), but some becomes part of the marine food chain.
A similar quantity is returned to the atmosphere. A very small portion of nonliving
organic matter each year ends up in sediments. The slow, historical accumulation of
that organic carbon is the source of our fossil fuels—oil, natural gas, and coal.
When these are burned, ancient carbon is returned to the atmosphere.
By comparison with the natural fluxes of carbon, the additional amounts
added to the atmosphere by combustion, cement production, and changes in land
use are modest, but they are enough to cause a significant response by the climate
system. Figure 15 summarizes the impact of human perturbations to the carbon

fluxes into and out of the atmosphere during the 1990s. Fossil fuel combustion and
cement production deliver 6.3 GtC/yr to the atmosphere, while land use changes,
such as biomass burning and harvesting of forests, add another 2.2 GtC/yr. Not all
of that 8.5 GtC/yr remains in the atmosphere, however. Greater carbon uptake
through purposeful reforestation efforts, as well as stimulated plant growth caused
by higher CO2 levels and increased nitrogen deposition on the soils from fossil fuel
combustion, removes around 2.9 GtC/yr. Finally, higher atmospheric CO2 increases
the oceans’ absorption of carbon, providing an additional 2.4 GtC/yr sink.
As Figure 15 suggests, fossil fuel combustion and land-use changes in the
1990s added about 8.5 GtC/yr to the atmosphere. Of that amount, 5.3 GtC/yr was
returned to the oceans or other terrestrial sinks, leaving about 3.2 GtC/yr remaining
in the atmosphere. The ratio of the amount of anthropogenic carbon emitted to the
amount that remains in the atmosphere is known as the airborne fraction. Using
these data, the airborne fraction has been:
Airborne fraction =

3.2 GtC/yr remaining in atmosphere
= 0.38 = 38%
8.5 GtC/yr anthropogenic additions

(17)

Thus, roughly speaking, somewhat less than half of the carbon we emit stays in the
atmosphere. But the airborne fraction is not necessarily a fixed quantity. For example, if large areas of land are deforested, the ability of the biosphere to absorb carbon would be reduced, and the atmospheric fraction would increase. Likewise, CO2
fertilization of terrestrial biomass can stimulate plant growth, which increases the
rate of removal of atmospheric carbon, so the airborne fraction could get smaller.
The airborne fraction also depends on how fast carbon is being added to the atmosphere. For scenarios with little or no growth in emissions or even declining emissions, the oceans and plants have more time to absorb carbon, so the atmospheric
fraction could be lower. On the other hand, for rapidly increasing emission rates,
carbon sinks cannot keep up and the fraction remaining in the atmosphere may be
higher.
The following example develops another useful relationship, this time between
the concentration of CO2 and the tons of carbon in the atmosphere. This ratio, coupled with an estimate of the airborne fraction, provides the key to predicting future
CO2 concentrations for various carbon emission scenarios.

EXAMPLE 2 Carbon Content of the Atmosphere
Find a relationship between the concentration of carbon dioxide and the total
amount of carbon in the atmosphere. The total mass of the atmosphere is estimated to be 5.12 * 1021 g.
Solution We will need to know something about the density of air. That, of
course, varies with altitude, but finding it under some particular conditions will
work. From Table 1 we know the concentration of each gas in air. Recall from
Section 1.2 that 1 mole of each gas occupies 22.414 * 10 - 3 m3 at Standard

If all of the atmosphere were at standard temperature and pressure, it would have
a density of 1291.8 g/m3, and its mass would still be 5.12 * 1021 g. Putting these
together gives

Notice this calculation has taken advantage of the fact that volumetric concentrations (ppm) are independent of temperature or pressure.
From Example 2, we have the following very useful relationship:
1 ppm CO2 = 2.12 GtC

(18)

For example, knowing the concentration of CO2 in 2006 was 380 ppm, the total
amount of carbon in the atmosphere can be estimated to be
380 ppm * 2.12 GtC/ppm = 806 GtC
EXAMPLE 3 Estimating the Rate of Change of CO2
Suppose global fossil fuel combustion emits 7.4 GtC/yr and cement production
adds another 0.5 GtC. Assuming the an airborne fraction of 0.38 and assuming
no change in emissions associated with land use, what rate of change in CO2 concentration would you expect?
Solution Including the 2.2 GtC/yr land-use emissions from Figure 17 gives a
total emission rate of 2.2 + 7.4 + 0.5 = 10.1 GtC/yr. Using the 0.38 airborne
fraction along with the 2.12 GtC/ppm ratio gives
¢CO2 =

10.1 GtC/yr * 0.38
= 1.8 ppm CO2/yr
2.12 GtC/ppm CO2

Carbon Emissions from Fossil Fuels
Use of energy and the resulting emissions of carbon vary considerably from country
to country. The United States, with less than 5 percent of the world’s population,
emits 22 percent of global energy-related CO2. The second largest emitter is China,

and as Figure 16 indicates, it is very rapidly closing the gap with the United States.
In fact, it is projected that China’s emissions will exceed those of the United States
by 2010. While China’s emissions growth is certainly worrisome, two other measures provide some insight into the root cause of our global carbon problem. On a
per capita basis, the United States emits far more carbon than any other country—
roughly double that of most other advanced countries and more than five times as
much as China (Figure 17). Moreover, it is the accumulated emissions from
developed countries that are overwhelmingly responsible for the rising CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere (Figure 18).

Carbon Emissions from Industrial Processes
A number of manufacturing processes result in carbon emissions on site that are not
included in the usual accounting for fossil fuel combustion. The primary source of
these industrial emissions is the calcination of limestone (CaCO3) to create lime
(CaO). These two compounds are basic materials in the production of cement, iron
and steel, and glass. Other industrial emissions result from the production and use
of soda ash (Na2CO3), the manufacture of carbon dioxide, and the production of
aluminum.
The largest single industrial CO2 source, however, results from cement production. Concrete, which is probably the most important building material in the
world, is made up of a mixture of Portland cement, fine aggregate (sand), coarse aggregate (crushed stone), and water. Portland cement, which is the binding agent for
concrete, derived its name in the early nineteenth century from its similarity to a
particular type of stone found on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England. It is typically on the order of 12 to 15 percent by weight of the concrete mix.
The major raw material needed for the manufacture of Portland cement is
limestone (CaCO3), along with a source of silicon such as clay or sand. Processing
of those materials is done in high-temperature kilns, usually fired with fossil fuels
whose combustion leads to CO2 emissions. In addition, the calcination of CaCO3
into lime (CaO) that occurs in those kilns emits its own CO2 as the following reaction suggests:
Limestone (CaCO3) + Clay or Sand (Si) + Heat : Cement (CaO, SiO2) + CO2
(19)

526

Global Atmospheric Change

The average intensity of carbon emissions from cement production is about
0.222 tons of carbon per ton of cement, with about half of that being the result of
calcinations and half released during combustion (Worrell et al., 2001). In addition,
power plants supplying electricity for plant operations emit their own carbon, but that
is usually not included in the category of industrial process emissions. All told, cement
manufacturing globally contributes close to 5 percent of all anthropogenic carbon
emissions. The total industrial emissions category accounts for about 0.8 GtC/yr.
As it turns out, fly ash from coal-fired power plants can be used as a replacement for some of the cement in concrete. This fly-ash concrete not only reduces carbon emissions by roughly one ton of CO2 per ton of replaced cement, but it also
results in a concrete that is stronger and more durable than its conventional counterpart. It also recycles a relatively useless waste product that would otherwise have to
be disposed of. Concrete mixtures with more fly ash than cement are now becoming
popular in the emerging green building industry.

Carbon Intensity of Fossil Fuels
The amount of carbon released per unit of energy delivered is called the carbon
intensity. Some fuels have high carbon intensity, such as coal, and some conversion
systems release no direct carbon at all, such as wind turbines or nuclear power.
Interestingly, biomass fuels may also be used in ways that emit little or no carbon
when new plants are grown to replace the ones that were burned. No energy system is
likely to have zero carbon emissions, however, since it is hard to avoid such emissions
during the mining, materials processing, and construction of any energy facility.

EXAMPLE 4 Carbon Intensity of Methane
Find the carbon intensity of methane based on its higher heating value (HHV) of
890 kJ/mol (which includes the energy of condensation of the water vapor
formed. Then find the carbon intensity based on the lower heating value (LHV)
of 802 kJ/mol.
Solution

First, write a balanced chemical reaction for the oxidation of methane:
CH4 + 2 O2 : CO2 + 2 H2O

So, burning 1 mol of CH4 liberates 890 kJ of energy while producing 1 mol of
CO2. Since 1 mol of CO2 has 12 g of carbon, the HHV carbon intensity of CH4 is
HHV carbon intensity =

12 g C
890 kJ

= 0.0135 gC/kJ = 13.5 gC/MJ

Similarly, the LHV carbon intensity would be
LHV carbon intensity =

12 gC
= 0.015 gC/kJ = 15.0 gC/MJ
802 kJ

The LHV carbon intensity assumes the latent heat of the water vapor produced is
not available as usable energy.

We can get a quick estimate of the carbon intensity of other fuels by using the
fact that the energy released during combustion of carbon-based fuels is approximately proportional to the amount of oxygen they consume (Baird, 1995). For
example, if we consider coal to be purely carbon and oil to be approximately CH2,
we can write the following oxidation reactions:
Coal:
Oil:
Natural gas:

C + O2 : CO2
CH2 + 1.5 O2 : CO2 + H2O
CH4 + 2 O2 : CO2 + 2 H2O

(20)
(21)
(22)

The same amount of carbon is released for each of these reactions, but since energy is
roughly proportional to oxygen consumption, per unit of carbon emitted we would
expect about 1.5 times as much energy from oil as coal and twice as much energy
from natural gas compared to coal. Turning that around, coal is more carbonintensive than oil, and oil emits more carbon than natural gas.
The actual LHV and HHV carbon intensities for typical fossil fuels, combined
with estimates of total carbon emissions, are given in Table 3. Note the slight difference between the carbon intensity of natural gas and the intensity of methane
itself found in Example 4. Natural gas is mostly methane, but it also includes other
hydrocarbons, which alters the calculation slightly. Since the proportions of
methane and other hydrocarbons vary from one source to another, the carbon
intensities given in Table 3 are “typical,” and you are likely to find other, slightly
different, values in the literature. The same goes for variations in types of coal.
Another comment worth making is that energy consumption figures in the United
States are often based on the higher heating value of a fuel, while most of the rest of
the world, including the IPCC, uses LHV values. The LHV value makes more sense
for power plants since they never recover the latent heat of their water vapor emissions, but HHV values are more appropriate for high-efficiency condensing furnaces
and water heaters, which do capture that heat. To be consistent with the IPCC, in
this chapter, all energy data and carbon intensities will be based on the LHV values.
The carbon intensity data given in Table 3 suggest that sizable reductions in carbon emissions are possible by switching from coal to natural gas. It is unfortunately
the case, however, that most of the world’s fossil fuel resources are in the form of coal.
It is interesting to note that almost 90 percent of the world recoverable resources of
coal are in just three regions: the United States, the former USSR, and China.
Table 4 presents data on the world’s fossil fuel resources. These resources
are shown as a resource base, which consists of already identified reserves plus an
estimate at the 50-percent probability level of remaining undiscovered resources. The

resources are also described as coming from conventional sources of the type now
being exploited, as well as unconventional sources that might be usable in the future.
Unconventional sources of oil include oil shale, tar sands, and heavy crude; unconventional natural gas sources include gas in Devonian shales, tight sand formations,
geo-pressurized aquifers, and coal seams. An additional column in Table 4 is labeled
“additional occurrences.” These are additional resources with unknown certainty of
occurrence and/or with unknown or no economic significance in the foreseeable future. Enormous amounts of methane locked in methane hydrates (CH4 # 6H2O) under
the oceans (estimated at over 800,000 EJ) are the most important of these.
Example 5 suggests what might happen to the CO2 concentration in the
atmosphere if we were to burn all of the world’s coal resource base.
EXAMPLE 5 Burning the World’s Coal
Estimate the increase in atmospheric CO2 if the 125,500 EJ of coal were to be
burned. Assume a constant airborne fraction of 38 percent.
Solution
Table 3:

We can first estimate the carbon content using the LHV value from

125,500 EJ * 25.8 gC/MJ * 1012 MJ/EJ * 10 - 15 GtC/gC = 3,238 GtC
which is roughly four times as much carbon as currently exists in the atmosphere.
Converting this to CO2 and including the 0.38 airborne fraction gives
¢CO2 =

3,238 GtC * 0.38
= 580 ppm CO2
2.12 GtC/ppm CO2

That would result in 2.5 times as much CO2 in the atmosphere as we have today.
In fact, it would likely be higher than that if the airborne fraction increases due to
the oceans ceasing to be such a good carbon sink.
It is interesting to note that a similar calculation to that shown in Example 5
suggests that the oil and gas resource base has the potential to add only about onethird as much CO2 to the atmosphere as would burning all of the world’s coal
resources. That calculation is less certain, however, because of the relatively unknown carbon emission factors that would be appropriate for the unconventional

529

Global Atmospheric Change

oil and gas resources. It is also complicated by the fact that the principal component
of natural gas, methane, is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, which
means methane leakage can amplify its potential global warming.
The carbon-intensity factors given in Table 3 suggest that switching from
coal to oil or natural gas would reduce emissions significantly. For example, it
would appear that switching from coal to natural gas would reduce carbon emissions by about 41 percent while delivering the same amount of energy. Example 6
shows how efficiency advantages as well as carbon advantages associated with using
natural gas can substantially increase that advantage.
EXAMPLE 6 Efficiency and Carbon Intensity Combined
Compare the carbon emissions to heat household water using the following three
energy systems: 1) a very good, 37 percent-efficient coal-fired power plant delivering electricity to a 100 percent-efficient electric water heater; 2) a new, 50 percentefficient natural-gas-fired combined-cycle power plant for that same electric water
heater; and 3) an 85 percent-efficient gas-fired water heater. Assume 6 percent
losses in electrical transmission lines.
Solution Let us base our comparison on 100 MJ of energy provided to each
system. Using the LHV values given in Table 3, burning 100 MJ of coal releases
2,580 g of carbon, while 100 MJ of natural gas releases 1,530 gC. As suggested
here, the coal-plant system delivers 100 * 0.37 * 0.94 = 34.8 MJ to heat water;
the more efficient gas-fired power plant delivers 100 * 0.50 * 0.94 = 47 MJ to
heat water; and using gas in the water heater delivers 85 MJ of heat.

The carbon intensities for each system are shown in the figure. Switching from
coal to gas in the power plant reduces carbon emissions for the electric water
heater by 56 percent. Using gas directly in the water heater reduces carbon emissions by 75 percent (much more than the 41 percent improvement expected based
just on the carbon intensity of natural gas versus coal).

Estimating Emissions: The Kaya Identity
Predicting future concentrations of carbon dioxide depends on numerous assumptions about population growth, economic factors, energy technology, and the
carbon cycle itself. The usual approach involves developing a range of emission scenarios that depend on those factors and then using those scenarios to drive mathematical models of how the atmosphere and climate system will react to those inputs.
At the level of treatment given in this short section, we can’t begin to approach the
complexity of those models; however, we can make a few simple calculations to at
least give a sense of some of the important factors.
One way to build simple models of environmental problems is to start with the
notion that impacts are driven by population, affluence, and technology, which is
sometimes referred to as the IPAT identity (Ehrlich and Holdren, 1971).
Environmental Impact = (Population) * (Affluence) * (Technology)

(23)

The following application of IPAT to carbon emissions from energy sources is often
referred to as the Kaya identity (Kaya, 1990).

Equation (24) incorporates the key quantities that drive our energy-related
carbon emissions. It includes economic and population scenarios plus two factors
that are central to energy: energy intensity and carbon intensity. Carbon intensity
has already been introduced. Energy intensity is the amount of energy required to
create a unit of economic activity as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). It
is usually thought of as a surrogate for the country’s energy efficiency. For example,
Japan, which only needs half the energy to produce a unit of GDP, is often considered to be roughly twice as energy efficient as the United States. While there is some
truth to that assertion, it sometimes masks differences in the standard of living and
the climate in each country. For example, the United States has larger houses that
are kept warmer in more severe winters, so if more energy is required it may have
more to do with those factors than whether or not homes are better insulated in one
country or the other. Japan is also a small, densely populated country with relatively short travel distances, so transportation energy would likely be less as well, even
with an equivalent level of transportation efficiency.
For example, the Kaya identity for the year 2010 looks something like this:
C = 6.9 * 109 people * $4,605/person-yr * 14.9 EJ>$1012 * 0.016 GtC/EJ
= 7.6 GtC/yr

Equation (24) expresses the carbon emission rate as the product of four terms:
population, GDP, carbon intensity, and energy intensity. Recall from Section 3.2 that
if each of the factors in a product can be expressed as a quantity that is growing (or
decreasing) exponentially, then the overall rate of growth is merely the sum of the
growth rates of each factor. That is, assuming each of the factors in (23) is growing
exponentially, the overall growth rate of carbon emissions r is given by
r = rP + rGDP/P + rPE/GDP + rC/PE

(25)

By adding the individual growth rates as has been done in (25), an overall growth
rate is found, which can be used in the following emission equation:
C = C0ert

(26)

where
C = carbon emission rate after t yrs (GtC/yr)
C0 = initial emission rate (GtC/yr)
r = overall exponential rate of growth (yr - 1)
Table 5 shows population, economic growth, carbon intensity, and energy intensity values that have been used in one of the most-cited IPCC emission scenarios
(IS92a) for energy. For the world as a whole, energy intensity and carbon intensity are
both improving over time, which helps offset population and economic growth.

Combining (27) with an estimate of the atmospheric fraction, along with our
2.12 GtC/ppm CO2 conversion factor, lets us make simple estimates of future CO2
concentrations in the atmosphere, as Example 7 demonstrates.
EXAMPLE 7 Kaya Estimate of Future Carbon Emissions
Emissions from fossil-fuel combustion in 2010 are estimated to be 7.6 GtC/yr. In
the same year, atmospheric CO2 concentration is estimated to be 390 ppm.
Assume the atmospheric fraction remains constant at 0.38.

a. Assuming the energy growth rates shown in Table 5 don’t change, estimate
the energy-related carbon-emission rate in 2050.
b. Estimate the cumulative energy-related carbon added to the atmosphere
between 2010 and 2050.
c. Add into your scenario carbon emissions from industrial processes (especially cement) of 0.7 GtC/yr in 2010 and growing at 1.3%/yr. Also add a
constant 0.9 GtC/yr from land-use changes. Estimate the CO2 concentration in 2050.
Solution
a. The overall growth rate in energy-related carbon emissions is just the sum
of the individual growth rates:
r = 1.40% + 1.53% - 0.97% - 0.24% = 1.72% = 0.0172/yr
With 40 years of growth at 1.72% per year, the emission rate in 2050
would be
C2050 = C2010erT = 7.6 e0.0172 * 40 = 15.1 GtC/yr
b. Over those 40 years, the cumulative energy emissions would be
Ctot =

(e - 1) =
(e0.0172 * 40 - 1) = 437 GtC

Land Use Ctot = 0.9 GtC/yr * 40 yrs = 36 GtC
Using the 2.12 GtC/ppm CO2 ratio and a 0.38 atmospheric fraction makes
our estimate of CO2 in 2050
CO2 = 390 +

(437 + 37 + 36) GtC * 0.38
= 481 ppm
2.12 GtC/ppm CO2

One of the weakest aspects of the Kaya identity as expressed in (24) is its use
of primary energy per GDP as a measure of energy efficiency. Primary energy, which
is in essence energy as it is taken out of the ground, can be reduced by efficiency
improvements on the supply side (e.g., more efficient electric power plants) as well
as on the demand side (e.g., by making light bulbs more efficient). One way to
address the two different efficiency improvements is to introduce another factor, call
it final energy FE, which is the energy purchased by consumers (e.g., gasoline, natural gas, electricity). Another extension is based on prospects for carbon capture and

This much more useful disaggregation breaks the overall carbon emissions into

ultimately stabilize CO2 is shown in Figure 19.

A Climate Sensitivity Parameter
As we pump more and more CO2 into the atmosphere, the marginal impact of each
additional ton decreases as its absorption bands approach saturation. That suggests
a nonlinear relationship between CO2 and the resulting global warming that it
causes. One commonly used representation of this phenomenon is given in (29).

The increase in surface temperature that results from a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere is called the climate sensitivity, ¢T2X. Notice what happens to (29) when

In other words, the logarithmic function suggests that for every doubling of CO2,
the surface temperature goes up by the same amount. For example if ¢T2X is 3°C,
then the first doubling raises the surface temperature by 3°C, doubling it again to
four times its initial value raises the temperature by another 3°C, and so on, as illustrated in Figure 20. The climate sensitivity ¢T2X is a convenient benchmark that is
often used to compare various general circulation computer models. It has long been
estimated to be between 1.5°C and 4.5°C, with the best estimate as of 2006 being
somewhere around 3.0°C.

Equilibrium Temperature and Realized Temperature
The surface temperatures dealt with thus far, Te and ¢Te, are known as equilibrium
temperatures; that is, they are temperatures that would eventually be reached for a
given atmospheric configuration. In reality, of course, the temperature of the Earth
will not adjust instantaneously to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. A considerable period of time is needed to warm the upper layer of the oceans and the surface of the land, which means the actual realized surface temperature of the Earth will
lag somewhat behind the equilibrium temperature. As shown in Figure 21, at any

given time, the difference between realized and equilibrium temperature is referred to
as the temperature commitment, while the time it takes to achieve equilibrium is the
lag time. Coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models indicate that the
realized temperature is roughly 60 to 85 percent of the equilibrium temperature.

7 The Other Greenhouse Gases and Aerosols
While most of the attention on greenhouse gases has been directed toward CO2
emissions, a number of other gases, as well as aerosols, contribute to our global
warming problem. After introducing each one, we will see how they interact with
each other and with the atmosphere to affect not only climate but also ozone depletion in the stratosphere.

Methane (CH4)
Methane is another naturally occurring greenhouse gas that is increasing in concentration as a result of human activities. As shown in Figure 22, methane concentrations in the atmosphere were approximately 750 parts per billion (ppb) for many
hundreds of years before they began their rapid climb in the 1800s. After a period of
very rapid rise, their concentration in the atmosphere in the early years of the
twenty-first century seems to be leveling off at about 1,750 ppb. Whether this is
some new steady-state level or a temporary pause, remains to be seen.
Methane is produced by bacterial fermentation under anaerobic conditions,
such as occurs in swamps, marshes, rice paddies, landfills, as well as in the digestive
tracks of ruminants. Total emissions have been estimated to be on the order of
600 teragrams per year, of which about 60 percent are related to human activities
such as agriculture, fossil fuel use, and waste disposal. Recent estimates of methane
emissions from short-lived biomass and plant litter under aerobic conditions suggest
methane’s contribution to the observed global warming may have been significantly
underestimated and a reassessment may be called for (Keppler et al., 2006).

FIGURE 23 Anthropogenic sources of methane emissions, totaling some 370 Tg/yr.
(Source: Based on Houweling et al., 1999.)

Almost half of anthropogenic methane emissions are the result of human food
production, especially rice production and livestock, including cattle, sheep, and
buffalo, which belch some 115 Tg of methane per year. Clearing and burning of biomass, in part to prepare land for grazing and crops, also contribute. Almost onethird of anthropogenic emissions are associated with fossil fuel use (Figure 23).
Methane has an absorption band centered at 7.7 mm, which places it right on
the edge of the atmospheric window and makes it a very potent greenhouse gas. Its
relatively short residence time in the atmosphere, on the order of 9 to 15 years, coupled with its high potency, suggests reducing methane emissions could be an effective means to reduce global warming on a relatively short timescale.
Methane is removed from the atmosphere primarily through reactions with
the hydroxyl radical (OH), as the following reaction suggests:
CH4 + OH + 9 O2 : CO2 + 0.5 H2 + 2 H2O + 5 O3

(30)

Methane is of course a greenhouse gas, so it has direct effects on the Earth’s radiation
balance. There are, however, a number of indirect effects that provide additional impacts, which reaction (30) helps explain. First, when methane reacts with hydroxyl
(OH), the concentration of OH decreases. With less OH available, the rate of removal
of CH4 slows down, lengthening the atmospheric lifetime of the remaining methane.
With a longer lifetime for CH4 in the atmosphere, it continues to absorb infrared for
a longer time, increasing its global warming potential. The second indirect effect that
(30) implies is that as methane reacts with hydroxyl, it produces water vapor. When
this reaction occurs in the troposphere, the increase in water vapor is insignificant, but
in the stratosphere, it becomes quite important. Finally, (30) indicates the destruction
of methane produces an increase in ozone, which is itself a greenhouse gas. The sum
of all of these indirect effects greatly increases methane’s climate impact.
There is some concern for the possibility that global warming could free large
amounts of methane currently frozen in permafrost in the far northern regions of
the world and could allow anaerobic decomposition of organic matter also frozen in
permafrost, producing more methane. This is an important example of a positive
feedback loop. Warming leading to increased releases of the greenhouse gas,
methane, could reinforce the original warming.

Nitrous Oxide (N2O)
Nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”) is another naturally occurring greenhouse gas that has
been increasing in concentration due to human activities (Figure 24). The current

atmospheric concentration is about 320 ppb, which is a 16 percent increase over the
preindustrial concentration of about 275 ppb.
Nitrous oxide is released into the atmosphere mostly during the nitrification
portion of the nitrogen cycle:

N2

Molecular

It is estimated that natural sources of N2O deliver 9 Tg per year to the atmosphere,
with most of that coming from oceans and wet forest soils. Anthropogenic sources,
which add another 6 Tg/yr, are largely the result of forest clearing and nitrogen fertilizers. Other sources include three-way catalytic converters on cars, combustion of
fuels containing nitrogen, and a variety of industrial processes such as the manufacture of nylon.
Apparently, there are no significant tropospheric sinks for N2O, and it is only
slowly degraded in the stratosphere by photolysis. As a result, it has a long atmospheric lifetime, estimated at about 120 years, which means perturbations in the
natural cycle will have long-lasting repercussions. Nitrous oxide has an absorption
band at 7.8 mm that is associated with a stretching of the bonds, and another at
8.6 mm associated with bending of the bond angle. The band at 7.8 mm is on the
shoulder of the atmospheric window, and the band at 8.6 mm is right in the window,
so N2O is a very potent greenhouse gas.

Halocarbons
Halocarbons are carbon-based molecules that have chlorine, fluorine, or bromine in
them. The carbon-to-fluorine bonds in halocarbons oscillate, and hence absorb, at
wavelengths around 9 mm, and other bond stretching and bending in halocarbons
also occur with frequencies in the atmospheric window, so these molecules are all
potent greenhouse gases. They are environmentally important not only because they
contribute to global warming, but also because chlorine and bromine atoms that
find their way into the stratosphere have the ability to catalytically destroy ozone, as
will be described later in this chapter.

538

Global Atmospheric Change

Subcategories of halocarbons include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which have
only carbon, fluorine, and chlorine, but no hydrogen; hydrochlorofluorocarbons
(HCFCs), which are like CFCs, but do contain hydrogen; hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
which contain no chlorine; and halons, which are carbon-based molecules containing bromine along with fluorine and perhaps chlorine. These halocarbon gases differ from all of the other radiatively active gases in that they do not occur naturally,
and their presence in the atmosphere is due entirely to human activities. Other
important halocarbons include carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), methyl chloroform
(CH3CCl3), and methyl bromide (CH3Br). With so many categories, it may help to
show some examples, which Table 6 does.
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are nontoxic, nonflammable, nonreactive, and
are not water soluble, which led to the belief when they were first invented that they
were truly benign chemicals. But because they are inert and don’t dissolve easily in
water, they aren’t destroyed by chemical reactions or removed from the troposphere
by rain. That means they have long atmospheric lifetimes, as Table 6 suggests. The
only known removal mechanism is photolysis by short-wavelength solar radiation,
which occurs after the molecules drift into the stratosphere. It is the chlorine freed
during this process that can go on to destroy stratospheric ozone. Similarly, halons,
which contain bromine, have no tropospheric sinks, and their only removal mechanism is also photochemical decomposition in the stratosphere, which releases the
ozone-depleting bromine.

Global Atmospheric Change

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are being introduced as replacements for
CFCs. By adding hydrogen to the molecules, they are no longer chemically inert,
which means chemical reactions can destroy them in the troposphere before they
have a chance to drift into the stratosphere. Notice the much shorter atmospheric
lifetimes for the HCFCs in Table 6. HCFCs are only temporary replacements for
CFCs, however, since they do still have some potential to deplete the ozone layer,
and they are still potent greenhouse gases.
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have no chlorine at all, so they are even better
than HCFCs in terms of stratospheric ozone protection. The hydrofluorocarbon
CH2FCF3 (HFC-134a) is quickly becoming the refrigerant of choice for automobile
air conditioners and refrigeration equipment. Even this chemical, however, has a sizable atmospheric lifetime (14.6 years), and, as a greenhouse gas, it is 1,400 times as
potent as CO2.
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are hydrocarbons containing only carbon and fluorine atoms. They are characterized by extreme stability, nonflammability, low toxicity, zero ozone depleting potential, and high global warming potential. For example,
tetrafluoromethane (CF4) has an atmospheric lifetime of 50,000 years, and its
global warming potential is 6,500 times that of carbon dioxide.
Halons have the ozone-destroying element bromine in them. They are very stable molecules with no tropospheric sinks, so they only release that bromine when
they eventually drift into the stratosphere and are broken apart by photolysis. The
primary use of halons is in fire extinguishers. They are nontoxic and leave no
residue when sprayed onto fires, so they are ideal for use in confined spaces containing critical equipment such as computers.
Halocarbon Numbering Systems. In Table 6, most of the halocarbons are
identified by a simple numerical designation as well as a chemical formula. The
CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs are referred to using a number system developed years
ago by DuPont. For example, trichlorofluoromethane, CFCl3, is CFC-11, and the
hydrochlorofluorocarbon CHF2Cl is HCFC-22. To determine the chemical formula
from a fluorocarbon number, begin by adding “90” to the number and then interpret the three-digit result as follows: The leftmost digit is the number of carbon
atoms, the middle digit is the number of hydrogen atoms, and the right digit is the
number or fluorines.
To determine the number of chlorine atoms, begin by visualizing molecules in
which each carbon atom forms four single bonds to other atoms (if the other atoms are
all hydrogens, this is the familiar alkane series: methane, ethane, propane, and so on):
4 sites
C
1 carbon

6 sites
C

C

2 carbons

2n + 2 sites

8 sites
C

C
3 carbons

n carbon atoms

A single carbon atom has four sites to fill, two carbon atoms have six sites, and so
forth. All of the sites will be occupied by hydrogen, fluorine, or chlorine. So, to find
the number of chlorines, just subtract the number of hydrogens and fluorines from
the total available sites. Each vacant bonding site not taken up by fluorine or hydrogen is occupied by chlorine.

540

Global Atmospheric Change

For example, to figure out what CFC-12 is, add 90 to 12 giving 102. So, there
is 1 carbon, no hydrogens, and 2 fluorines. With 1 carbon there are 4 sites available,
2 of which are taken by fluorine, leaving 2 for chlorine.
CFC-12

12 + 90 = 102

Thus, CFC-12 is CF2Cl2.
The halons also have a number system, but this one is not so complicated.
Halons are given a four-digit designation, with the leftmost digit being the number
of carbons, the second is fluorines, the third is chlorines, and the fourth is bromine.
For example, H-1211 is CF2ClBr.
EXAMPLE 8 Halocarbon Numbering
a. What is the chemical composition of CFC-115?
b. What is the CFC number for CH2FCF3?
c. What is H-2402?
Solution
a. CFC-115: Adding 90 to 115 gives 205. Thus, a molecule contains 2 carbons, no hydrogens, and 5 fluorines. Two carbons have 6 bonding sites, 5
of which are taken by fluorine. The remaining site is taken by chlorine. The
chemical formula would therefore be C2F5Cl (more correctly written as
CClF2CF3).
b. CH2FCF3 has 2 carbons, 2 hydrogens, and 4 fluorine atoms. Subtracting 90
from 224 gives 134. There is no chlorine or hydrogen, so this halocarbon is
a hydrofluorocarbon, HFC-134. Notice that we can’t tell whether this is
CHF2CHF2 or CH2FCF3. To distinguish one isomer from another, a letter
designation is added. For example, CHF2CHF2 is HFC-134 (1,1,2,2tetrafluoroethane), and CH2FCF3 is HFC-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane).

Refrigerants. Chlorofluorocarbons have many unusual properties that have led
to their widespread use. For example, they are easily liquefied under pressure, and
when that pressure is released, they evaporate and produce very cold temperatures.

541

Global Atmospheric Change

In fact, they were originally developed to satisfy the need for a nontoxic, nonflammable, efficient refrigerant for home refrigerators. Before they were introduced in
the early 1930s, the most common refrigerants were ammonia, carbon dioxide,
isobutane, methyl chloride, methylene chloride, and sulfur dioxide. All had significant disadvantages. They were either toxic, noxious, highly flammable, or required
high operating pressures that necessitated heavy, bulky equipment. From those perspectives, CFCs are far superior to any of the gases that they replaced. As a side
note, fluorocarbons used in refrigeration equipment are often referred to with a
“Refrigerant” number. For example, CFC-12 is often called “Refrigerant-12” or,
more simply, R-12. The DuPont trade name Freon has also been used, so occasionally it is still called F-12. The “R” designation is also applied to other hydrocarbons
such as methane (R-50) and ethane (R-170).
Until recently, most refrigerators, freezers, and automobile air conditioners
used CFC-12 as the refrigerant, and large building air conditioning systems have
tended to use CFC-11. CFC refrigerants do not wear out, so as long as they are
sealed into equipment, the total emission rate can be small. Automobile air conditioners, however, tend to develop leaks that necessitate periodic recharging of their
systems. Not long ago, when car air conditioners were serviced, the old refrigerant
was usually vented to the atmosphere rather than being captured and recycled,
which compounded the loss rate. As a result, automobile air conditioners used to
contribute on the order of 20 percent of all emissions of CFCs in the United States.
The Montreal Protocol and subsequent changes in the Clean Air Act have changed
that picture significantly. Production and importation of CFCs ended in 1996, and
air conditioners on new cars now tend to use HFC-134a and HFC-152a, which
contain no chlorine. Only licensed facilities that use CFC recycling equipment can
service older automobile air conditioners.
Aerosol Propellants. When CFCs were first hypothesized as a danger to the
ozone layer by Molina and Rowland (1974), over half of worldwide emissions were
from aerosol propellants for products such as deodorants, hair spray, and spraypaint cans. At that time, the United States alone was using over 200,000 tons per
year of CFC-11 and CFC-12 in aerosols. The EPA responded rather quickly to the
threat, and acting under the Toxic Substances Control Act, it banned the use of
CFCs in nonessential aerosol propellant applications beginning in 1979. Norway,
Sweden, and Canada adopted similar restrictions, but the rest of the world lagged
far behind until recently. The Montreal Protocol has led to total bans in most of the
developed world. Replacements for CFCs in aerosols include isobutane, propane,
and carbon dioxide. In some applications, simple pumps or “roll on” systems have
replaced the propellants.
Foamed Plastics. The second most common use for CFCs in general, and the
most common use for CFC-11 in particular, has been in the manufacture of various
rigid and flexible plastic foams found in everything from seat cushions to hamburger “clamshell” containers to building insulation. When liquid CFCs are allowed to
vaporize in plastic, they create the tiny bubbles that make the plastic foamy.
Sheets of rigid “closed cell” urethane foams are used primarily as thermal
insulation in buildings and refrigeration equipment. In such applications, the CFCs

542

Global Atmospheric Change

or HCFCs, which are poor thermal conductors, trapped in foam cells reduce the
heat transfer capabilities of the product. CFCs have also been used to manufacture
nonurethane, rigid foams such as extruded polystyrene (Dow’s trade name is
Styrofoam) used extensively for egg cartons and food service trays, and expanded
polystyrene foam, which is used to make drinking cups. Since CFCs are trapped in
the holes in closed-cell foams, they are only slowly released into the atmosphere as
the material ages or is eventually crushed. It is estimated that the “bank” of CFCs
and HCFCs trapped in rigid foam insulation is equivalent to about 19 Gt of CO2.
New production of HCFCs will be banned by 2020.
Replacements for these foams are possible. Polyisocyanurate foams made with
hydrocarbon blowing agents such as pentane have no global warming potential or
ozone-depletion potential, and they are excellent insulators. Fiberglass insulation,
although thermally not as effective per unit of thickness, also contains no CFCs.
Various cardboards and other paper products can be used to replace many of the
polystyrene applications in the food industry.
Flexible foams, which are used in furniture, automobile seats, and packaging,
have cells that are open to the atmosphere (open-cell). Hence, CFC release is almost
immediate. These foams are made using carbon dioxide as the primary blowing
agent, but the CO2 is often augmented with methylene chloride.

Ozone (O3)
Ozone has a strong absorption band at 9 mm, right in the middle of the atmospheric window (refer to Figure 11), so clearly it is a greenhouse gas of importance. It has,
however, proven to be a difficult one to understand. It is not a “well-mixed” gas in
the atmosphere the way all of the greenhouse gases described up to this point are.
Not only does its concentration vary from place to place and time to time around
the globe, but its effect on climate depends on its vertical distribution as well.
Ozone in the troposphere is formed by photochemical reactions involving relatively short-lived precursor gases, including NOx, nonmethane-hydrocarbons, and
CO. It is the principal gas in photochemical smog. And since smog is associated
with the major industrialized areas of the world, it is not surprising that tropospheric ozone concentrations are higher in the Northern Hemisphere than in the
Southern Hemisphere. Those concentrations also vary seasonally as sunnier summer months energize the formation of ozone. Ozone transported from the industrialized countries in the Northern Hemisphere to the Arctic has been identified as a
major contributor to the current rapid warming of that region.
In the stratosphere, ozone concentrations are decreasing as a result of the
attacks by chlorine and bromine released by UV-exposed CFCs and halons. These
stratospheric ozone losses also vary by geographic location and by season as the
annual appearance of the ozone hole over Antarctica in September and October certainly demonstrates. This ozone loss helps open the atmospheric window, which offsets some of the global warming caused by halocarbon emissions. As emissions of
CFCs and halons into the atmosphere are curtailed, it is expected that ozone will recover in the early part of the twenty-first century, so this helpful impact of ozone
depletion will diminish.

Global Atmospheric Change

Aerosols
Suspensions of particles having an effective diameter of less than 10 mm are called
aerosols. Some particles enter the atmosphere as solids (e.g., soil dust), and others
are formed in the atmosphere when gases such as sulfur dioxide condense into liquid
particles such as sulfates. Combustion of fossil fuels and biomass burning are the
principal anthropogenic sources of aerosols. Natural sources of aerosols include
wind-blown soil dust, evaporation of sea-spray droplets, and volcanic eruptions.
While the natural emission rates from these and other sources far exceeds anthropogenic emissions, most of these particulates are so large that they quickly drop out
of the troposphere. Smaller particles, especially ones that reach the stratosphere, are
much more important in terms of their impact on climate as well as human health.
Aerosols have characteristics that make them considerably different from the
well-mixed, long-lived greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, N2O, and halocarbons. For
one, they have atmospheric lifetimes that are measured in days or weeks in the troposphere, and a few years in the stratosphere, while greenhouse gases have lifetimes
measured usually in decades, but for some, in thousands of years. The aerosols in
the troposphere today are mostly particles that entered the atmosphere within the
past few days. That means aerosol concentrations can vary considerably from week
to week and from place to place. That short lifetime also implies that the radiative
impacts of aerosols are likely to be regional phenomena, centered around the industrialized areas of the world, whereas greenhouse gas impacts are much more uniformly distributed around the globe. In fact, in some heavily industrialized parts of
the world, the cooling caused by aerosols can be greater than the warming due to
greenhouse gases. That doesn’t necessarily mean, however, that such an area would
experience cooling, since regional temperatures are so much affected by other factors.
Aerosols are also different from most greenhouse gases in that they cause both
heating and cooling of the atmosphere. As Figure 25 suggests, they affect the
Earth’s energy balance in three ways: (1) they can reflect incoming solar radiation
back into space, which increases the Earth’s albedo; (2) they can provide cloud condensation nuclei, which increases cloud reflectivity and cloud lifetime, which also
increases albedo; and (3) carbonaceous particles such as soot from fossil-fuel combustion can increase the atmospheric absorption of incoming solar energy. Sulfates
and white smoke increase the albedo by enhancing atmospheric and cloud reflection,

which helps cool the planet, and solar absorption by black smoke causes warming.
The term black carbon (BC) is used to describe that black smoke, which consists of
various carbonaceous products of incomplete combustion, including chars, charcoals, and soots.
The direct effect of black carbon absorption of incoming solar energy, warming the air itself, is amplified by its indirect effect as soot is transported and deposited
onto snow-covered areas. By making the snow darker, its albedo is reduced causing
further warming. And, as the soot-blackened snow melts, it exposes darker undersurfaces, further reducing albedo. These indirect albedo effects are estimated to
more than double the warming impact of black carbon, making it a very important
contributor to current global warming. Its importance, coupled with its extremely
short atmospheric lifetime, suggest reducing black carbon may be the quickest way
to slow the current rate of global warming.

8 Radiative Forcing of Climate Change
In the global equilibrium model shown earlier in Figure 12, the incoming 235 W/m2
of solar energy absorbed by the Earth and its atmosphere is exactly balanced by
235 W/m2 of outgoing long-wave radiation. If, for some reason, an additional
amount of energy is added to the incoming energy, then the balance will be temporarily upset. Over time, however, the climate system will adjust to that change either by either increasing or decreasing the surface temperature of Earth until a
balance is once again attained.
Mathematically, we can represent that process as follows. In Figure 26, the
incoming energy absorbed, and outgoing energy being radiated, are shown as they
exist at the top of the troposphere—that is, at the tropopause. Initially, the balanced
system has energy absorbed equal to energy radiated:
Qabs = Qrad

(31)

When the system is perturbed by adding radiative forcing, ¢Q (W/m2), to the
incoming absorbed energy, a new equilibrium will eventually be established so that
(Qabs + ¢Qabs) + ¢Q = (Qrad + ¢Qrad)

Global Atmospheric Change

where the deltas refer to changes in the quantity in question. Subtracting (31) from
(32) gives
¢Q = ¢Qrad - ¢Qabs

(33)

As we shall see, the value of the radiative forcing concept is that it provides a
common currency for comparing the impacts of changes in individual greenhouse
gases and aerosols, changes in albedo, and changes in the sun’s radiation.
Determining the radiative forcing associated with these has been one of the most important research areas for atmospheric scientists.

Another Climate Sensitivity Parameter
The key question, of course, is how much does the equilibrium surface temperature
change ¢Te for a given change in radiative forcing, ¢Q. The quantity that links the
two is called the mean climate sensitivity parameter (l) with units of °C of temperature rise per W/m2 of radiative forcing. A linear expression for this relationship is
often used:
¢Te = l¢Q

(34)

It has been established that a doubling of CO2 is equivalent to a radiative forcing
¢Q of about 4.2 W/m2. We already had another climate sensitivity parameter
¢T2X, which is the equilibrium surface temperature change for a doubling of CO2.
The relationship between these two climate sensitivities is therefore
l L

¢T2X °C

b
4.2 W/m2

(35)

Following a procedure outlined by the National Research Council (NRC, 2003) as a
first cut at estimating l, we might consider the Earth as a blackbody with no greenhouse effect and no complicating feedback factors, just as we did in Figure 9. The
rate at which this Earth radiates energy (on a per-unit-of-area basis) is given by the
Stefan-Boltzmann equation,
Q = sT4e

(36)

dQ

(37)

from which,

Using (8), we already have derived the equilibrium surface temperature Te for this
simplified Earth and found it to be 254 K. Substituting that value, along with the
Stefan-Boltamann constant, into (34) gives
lB =

(38)

where the “B” in lB indicates this was derived assuming a blackbody Earth. If this sensitivity is used in (34) with a ¢T2X forcing of 4.2 W/m2, we would expect a doubling
of CO2 to cause an equilibrium surface temperature increase of 4.2 * 0.27 = 1.1°C,
which is far below what most general circulation models predict.

546

Global Atmospheric Change

Not surprisingly, (38) is not a very good estimate because it does not account
for any of a number of complicating feedback factors.
Ice-Albedo Feedback. Ice and snow are highly reflective. If global warming
decreases their surface area, they will reflect less solar radiation (decreasing the albedo)
and absorb more of it, which leads to greater warming. That is an example of a positive
feedback effect in that a perturbation in one direction or another feeds back onto itself,
increasing the original perturbation.
Water-Vapor Feedback. Water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas.
Global warming increases evaporation, which enhances the absorption of longwavelength energy radiated from the surface. That means the atmosphere warms up
and radiates more energy back to the surface, which increases surface temperature.
It is another positive feedback loop.
Cloud Feedbacks. Since clouds can be highly reflective, surface warming could
lead to more clouds, which could increase the albedo, which could lower the surface
temperature. This is an example of a negative feedback effect, in which feedback reduces the original perturbation. On the other hand, clouds contain water vapor,
which is a greenhouse gas, so increasing clouds could lead to an enhanced greenhouse effect, which leads to more surface warming—positive feedback. Modeling
both phenomena has proved to be one of the most challenging problems in climate
science, but the consensus seems to be that the net effect of clouds yields a positive
feedback.
Lapse-Rate Feedbacks. Water vapor and clouds in the upper troposphere are
colder than the surface of the Earth, which means they radiate less energy toward
space than does the surface. The difference between the two is, in essence, the greenhouse effect. If the lapse rate changes, which is the rate of decrease of temperature
with altitude, then the temperature difference from surface to upper troposphere
also changes, which can lead to greater or lesser greenhouse effect. When surface
warming causes the lapse rate to increase, the greenhouse effect will be enhanced,
which is a positive feedback.
Figure 27 shows one way to model feedback loops using a summing device
and a feedback loop with a gain factor of g. The input is the blackbody sensitivity
lB. The output l is the climate sensitivity factor, including the impacts of feedback.
The feedback factor g is positive for processes having positive feedback, and negative for those with negative feedback. From the diagram, we can write the following:

(41)

EXAMPLE 9 Climate Sensitivity with Feedback
Suppose the combined radiative forcing of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and solar
intensity is 4.2 W/m2, which is the focing that is thought to result from a doubling
of CO2. Using the blackbody sensitivity found in (38), lB = 0.27°C>(W/m2), find
the global equilibrium temperature increase when the following feedback factors
are included:

b.
c.

Water-vapor feedback, g = 0.5
Water-vapor feedback, g = 0.5, plus ice-albedo feedback, g = 0.25
Water-vapor feedback, g = 0.5, plus cloud feedback, g = -0.25
What feedback factor would yield an equilibrium ¢T2X = 3.0 K?

shows the feedback factor needs to be about 0.62 to produce the often-used
¢T2X = 3°C. Figure 28 points out how sensitive l becomes as the feedback factor

increases. Once a strong positive feedback is present in the system, the impacts of
other feedback processes are amplified.
The preceding analysis depends on a number of gross simplifications. It is a
linear response model, which is really only valid for small perturbations around the
equilibrium climate system. It assumes the various feedback processes (cloud, ice,
lapse rate, and so on) are independent and additive, when in fact they do interact
with each other. And it is an equilibrium analysis that ignores thermal capacitance
and lag time responses, when the actual climate system is certainly not in equilibrium and won’t be so for a good long time. Finally, the mathematics of (40) blows
up for a feedback factor of g = 1, at which point the slightest radiative forcing
would produce an infinite temperature change. It is introduced here as a rough
guide to the relative importance of feedback processes.

Radiative Forcings Since Preindustrial Times
The concept of radiative forcing of climate change can be applied to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, changes in aerosols from natural and
anthropogenic sources, ozone depletion in the stratosphere, photochemically produced ozone accumulation in the troposphere, and the natural variability in solar intensity reaching Earth’s outer atmosphere. Both positive and negative forcings are
possible. Positive forcings contribute to global warming, while negative forcings
tend to cool the Earth.
Gases and particulate matter added to the atmosphere can exert both direct
and indirect radiative forcing effects. Direct forcing is caused by substances in the
atmosphere that have actually been emitted from some source. Indirect forcings are
those that occur when those substances go on to cause other atmospheric changes
that affect radiative properties of the atmosphere. For example, aerosols have a
direct effect on forcing when they absorb or reflect sunlight. Aerosols can also cause
an indirect effect when they induce changes in the albedo of clouds. Halocarbons

549

Global Atmospheric Change

provide another example of direct and indirect effects. The direct effect of halocarbons is an increase in radiative forcing as these gases absorb long-wave radiation
from the Earth. They also, however, cause an indirect effect by destroying ozone in
the stratosphere. Recall from Figure 11 that ozone absorbs in the middle of the
atmospheric window, so ozone destruction opens the window and allows the Earth
to cool more readily. The direct effect of halocarbons therefore contributes to global warming, while the indirect effect of destroying ozone works in the opposite direction to help to cool the planet.
Figure 29 shows global average radiative forcing estimates associated with
CO2, the other greenhouse gases (CH4, CFCs, N2O), aerosols, land-use changes,
and the estimated increase in solar intensity that has occurred in this period. Aerosol
effects are broken out into the positive forcing caused by black carbon and the negative forcings caused by the indirect impact of reflective aerosols and induced cloud
changes.
Several features stand out. Carbon dioxide provides the largest forcing, but the
others are significant; conventional air pollution, responsible for black carbon and
ozone, is also substantial; and the largest uncertainties are associated with aerosol

effects, both direct and on clouds. In spite of the significant black carbon contribution to warming, the net effect of aerosols seems to be negative, meaning global
cooling, but the uncertainties shown make that not a clear assertion.
The 2007 IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4) asserts with very high confidence that the globally averaged net effect of human activities since 1750 has been
one of warming with a radiative forcing of +1.6 W/m2 (+0.6 to +2.4). The combined forcing due to greenhouse gases themselves is +2.3 W/m2, and its rate of increase during the industrial era is very likely to have been unprecedented in more
than 10,000 years.
EXAMPLE 10 Combined Forcings
Using the IPCC estimate of 1.6 W/m2 net radiative forcing shown in Figure 29,
along with an equilibrium temperature increase caused by those forcings of
0.8°C, find the following:
a. The climate sensitivity factor l, °C>(W/m2)
b. The feedback gain factor g
c. The temperature climate sensitivity ¢T2X (°C)
Solution
a. From (34), we get the climate sensitivity:
¢Te

l =

b. From (40), the feedback gain factor is

g = 1 = 1 = 0.54
l
0.5
c. From (35), we estimate the temperature sensitivity for a doubling of CO2:
¢T2X = 4.2l = 4.2 * 0.54 = 2.27°C
The simple summation of forcings suggested in the preceding example assumes
that 1 W/m2 of one constituent (e.g., CO2) has the same impact as 1 W/m2 of another
(e.g., solar intensity). A new radiant forcing efficacy factor E is based on weighing
each climate sensitivity in terms of its global warming impact with respect to CO2.
l
(42)
E =
lCO2
For example, the well-mixed greenhouse gases have an efficacy of 1.0, while
the direct and indirect effect of aerosols might have an efficacy of 0.72 (National
Research Council, 2005). If, for example, the forcing of greenhouse gases is
3.0 W/m2 while aerosols have a net forcing of -1.8 W/m2, the combined impact of
the two with and without considering efficacy would be
(CO2 + aerosol)-forcing without efficacy = 3.0 + (-1.8) = 1.2 W/m2
(CO2 + aerosol)-forcing with efficacy = 3.0 * 1.0 + (-1.8) * 0.72 = 1.7 W/m2
Clearly, the efficacy factor concept could have a significant impact on models based
on radiant forcing.

551

Global Atmospheric Change

9 Global Warming Potential
The Global Warming Potential (GWP) is a weighting factor that allows comparisons
to be made between the cumulative global warming impact over a specified period of
time of some greenhouse gas and a simultaneous emission of an equal mass of CO2.
There are three primary factors that affect GWPs. The first is the radiative forcing
associated with the addition to the atmosphere of a unit mass of each greenhouse gas.
The second is based on estimates of the rate at which that unit mass injected decays
over time. The third is related to the cumulative radiative forcing that the unit addition to the atmosphere will have over some period of time into the future.
Some examples of how the GWP index can be used include the following:
1. By combining GWP with estimates of the cost of curtailing emissions of each
greenhouse gas, a country-by-country, least-cost approach to prevention of
climate change could be identified.
2. GWPs could facilitate trading of emissions reductions among countries. For
example, one country might decide the least expensive way to offset emissions of CO2 might be to reduce emissions of CH4 in another. Buying and
selling international carbon emission offsets could lead to technology and
economic transfer from the developed to the developing countries (Swisher
and Masters, 1991).
3. Country by country rankings of their individual contributions to climate
change are made possible. Quantifiable goals can then be established for
future reductions.
4. Combined with other indices, they could be part of an overall environmental
impact assessment for products and industrial process audits. Included in an
environmental labeling system, consumer choices could be affected.

Calculating the GWP
Mathematically, we imagine an impulse function in which 1 kg of the greenhouse
gas in question and 1 kg of CO2 are emitted into the atmosphere at the same time.
As the concentration of each gas decreases with time, so does the radiative forcing
associated with the remaining amount of gas. Mathematically, the GWP of a greenhouse gas is given by

(Source: IPCC, 1995.)

For some greenhouse gases, Rg can be modeled using a simple exponential
decay function. And for some, the radiative efficiency is a constant. Neither is the
case for the comparison gas, CO2. As Figure 30 suggests, CO2 decay is rapid during
the first few decades as the biosphere absorbs the carbon, and then for next few
hundred years, it decays at a much slower rate corresponding to the slow uptake of
the oceans. To further complicate matters, the decay also depends on the assumptions made for the background concentration of CO2. Two curves for RCO2 are
shown, one corresponding to an atmosphere in which CO2 concentration is unchanging, while the other has been drawn for a more realistic atmosphere in which
CO2 reaches 650 ppm by the year 2200.
The choice of the GWP time horizon that policy makers might use depends on
the issues that are being addressed. For example, shorter time horizons might be
used when it is the rate of change of global temperature, rather than the ultimate
temperature increase, that is of concern. Short time horizons would also seem
appropriate when the most effective greenhouse abatement strategy is needed to head
off possibly abrupt climate changes that might be triggered when warming reaches
some threshold level. On the other hand, long time horizons might be used to evaluate strategies to avoid long, slow, irreversible impacts such as sea level changes.

Carbon Dioxide Equivalents of Greenhouse Gases
Table 7 shows GWPs for a number of widely used chemicals. As can be seen, all of
these species have very high GWPs relative to CO2 because they all absorb in the
atmospheric window. Notice the three standard time horizons for GWPs are 20 years,
100 years, and 500 years. By including a time horizon, the GWP accounts for the

greater impact that a gas with a long atmospheric lifetime will have compared with
one that quickly disappears after it has been emitted. For example, CFC-115 and a
replacement HCFC-22 have almost identical 20-year GWPs, but the longer atmospheric lifetime of CFC-115 (1,700 vs. 12 years) means its 100-year GWP is more than
five times higher (7,200 vs. 1,700), and its 500-year GWP is almost 20 times higher.
Notice the extremely high GWPs for several gases in this table. Some of the
HFCs, which were developed as alternatives to ozone-depleting substances, stand
out—especially trifluoromethane (HFC-23). HFC-23 has a lifetime of 270 years and
a 100-yr GWP of 11,700. Reducing HFC-23 in developing countries has become
one of the most sought-after (least expensive) approaches to meeting Kyoto Protocol
obligations. The perfluorocarbons CF4 (tetrafluoromethane) and C2F6 (hexafluoroethane), used in semiconductor manufacturing and primary aluminum production, have extremely long atmospheric lifetimes and GWPs thousands of times
higher than CO2. One gas, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) has a GWP of 22,200, which
gives it the distinction of being the most potent greenhouse gas the IPCC has ever
evaluated. SF6 has excellent dielectric properties and was widely used in electric
power and distribution equipment.
The purpose of the GWPs is to assess the relative importance of various emissions, which means the GWP for each gas should be multiplied by the emission rate for
the gas. The 100-year GWPs are often used to describe non-CO2 emissions in terms of
carbon dioxide equivalents (CDE, or CO2-eq), as Example 11 demonstrates.

Global Atmospheric Change

EXAMPLE 11 Carbon Dioxide Equivalent of Greenhouse Gases
Annual anthropogenic emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O are estimated to be
27,000 MtCO2/yr, 370 MtCH4/yr, and 6 MtN2O/yr (where “Mt” means million
metric tons). Compare the impacts of these three gases over a 100-year time horizon, and find the total equivalent CO2 emissions.
Solution The comparison will be based on the products of emission rates and
GWPs. GWPs are found in Table 7, and the emission rates are given. Carbon
dioxide has a GWP of 1 (by definition) over all of the time horizons, so its product doesn’t change:
CO2:
CH4:
N2O:

GWP100 * emissions = 1 * 27,000 Mt/yr = 27,000 MtCO2
GWP100 * emissions = 23 * 370 Mt/yr = 8,510 MtCO2-eq
GWP100 * emissions = 296 * 6 MtN2O/yr = 1,776 MtCO2-eq

The total carbon dioxide equivalence of the combined emissions is
27,000 + 8,510 + 1,776 = 37,286 MtCO2-eq
If we multiply this by the C/CO2 ratio of 12>44 and switch the units, we can get
an equivalence expressed in gigatons of carbon:
Total CO2, CH4, N2O emissions = 37.3 GtCO2-eq * 12>44 = 10.1 GtC-eq
Of this 10.1 GtC total, 7.4 GtC is actual carbon dioxide, and 2.8 GtC is other gases.
Example 11 suggests that almost three-fourths of the impact for the next century from current emissions of the three key greenhouse gases will be caused by CO2.
If we redo the calculations using 20-year GWPs, the near-term importance of controlling methane emissions stands out. Over the next 20 years, today’s CH4 emissions will
have nearly as much impact on climate (85 percent as much) as today’s CO2 emissions.
Applying the above carbon dioxide equivalence approach to emissions puts the
combination of greenhouse gases into perspective. Figure 31 shows the GWPweighted emissions of U.S. greenhouse gases, and Figure 32 shows a “spaghetti chart”
representation of their sources and the end uses responsible for those emissions.

That analysis, however, didn’t include the global warming impacts of the roughly
1.5 percent methane leakage to the atmosphere during the mining, transportation, and storage of natural gas before the gas makes it to the house. Including
that leakage, what is the equivalent carbon emission rate for the 85 percentefficient gas water heater? Use the 20-year GWP for natural gas.
Solution Starting with 100 MJ of natural gas, we’ll lose 1.5 MJ in leakage and
deliver 98.5 MJ to the gas-fired water heater.
From Table 3, the LHV carbon intensity of natural gas is 15.3 gC/MJ. From
Table 7, the 20-year GWP of methane is 62 gCO2/gCH4. So, the CO2 equivalent
of that 1.5 MJ of methane leakage is

which is still a 68 percent savings compared to the 272 gCO2 for the electric
water heater (without including the leakage, the savings in Example 6 was
75 percent).

10 IPCC Assessment Reports
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an organization founded
in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO). Its role is to assess scientific, technical, and
socioeconomic information related to the risks, potential impacts, and options for
adaptation and mitigation of human-induced climate change. The IPCC itself does
not carry out research but instead relies on literally thousands of climate and policy
experts from around the globe who contribute their expertise as authors and reviewers of IPCC reports. Its principal output has been a series of assessment reports,
which are based on peer-reviewed and published scientific and technical literature.
The first IPCC Assessment Report, completed in 1990, provided the overall scientific and policy basis for addressing climate change adopted by the 1992 UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which entered into force in
1994. The Second Assessment Report (SAR), Climate Change 1995, was instrumental in negotiations that led to the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol by the UNFCCC in
1997.
The Third Assessment Report (TAR), Climate Change 2001, and the Fourth
Assessment Report (AR4), which was released in 2007, continue to be the most authoritative summary documents on the status of climate research. The IPCC also
prepares special reports and technical papers to fill the gaps between those major,
comprehensive assessment reports.
The IPCC is organized around three focus areas: Science (Working Group I),
Impacts and Adaptation (Working Group II), and Mitigation (Working Group III).
The mitigation group develops scenarios that describe possible combinations of
population, economic growth, and technology drivers that lead to future greenhouse
gas emissions. These emissions scenarios are then handed off to the climate modeling community, which converts them into regional and global temperatures and climate impacts. Those, in turn, can inform decision makers about the potential to
mitigate these impacts (by modifying the emissions driving forces) and/or adapting
to those climate changes (e.g., raise the levees). Figure 33 summarizes these interactions and helps frame the climate problem in terms of both sustainable development
and environment.

The Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES)
The IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) published in 2000 is based
on a set of four storylines that weave demographic, technological, and economic
driving forces into four distinct scenarios that can be translated into future emissions. Scenarios provide alternative images about how the future might unfold. They
are not forecasts, nor do they carry with them any probabilities of their likelihood.
No preferences for one scenario over another are offered by IPCC, and they are not
meant to infer policy recommendations. They are narratives, around which emission
scenarios can be built.
The SRES report describes four narrative storylines, designated as A1, A2, B1,
and B2. The A storylines focus more on economic growth, while the B storylines
have more of an environmental emphasis. The A1 and B1 lines are based on more of
a homogeneous, globalized future, while the A2 and B2 imagine a more fractured

are summarized in Figure 34.
Within each of the four storylines, multiple scenarios have been developed.
Table 8 summarizes population, world GDP, and primary energy that result from a
single illustrative scenario for each of the six categories (A1F, A1B, A1T, A2, B1,
B2), but in reality there are many more within each category. One clue to the
emphasis placed on technology in each scenario is the relative dependence on coal
versus zero-carbon energy sources for each scenario, also shown in the table.
Carbon dioxide emissions that result from these scenarios are shown in Figure 35.

FIGURE 36 Simulations of CO2 concentrations for three SRES scenarios done for the
Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).
(Source: Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, 2006.)

The SRES scenarios provide estimates for greenhouse gas emissions over the
next 100 years or so. Those emission rates can then be used as inputs for climate
models that estimate future atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4, N2O, and
other greenhouse gases, from which GWP-weighted equivalent CO2 concentrations
can be estimated. Figure 36 shows one set of simulations done at the Max Planck
Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) in Hamburg for three of the SRES scenarios,
A1B, A2, and B1, which cover the range of scenarios shown in Figure 35. Under
the most optimistic scenario B1, CO2 stabilizes at close to double the preindustrial
concentration.

General Circulation Models
Scenarios for future greenhouse gas emissions are used as inputs to computer models that attempt to predict likely impacts of these perturbations on the Earth’s climate
systems. At this point in time, even the largest supercomputer cannot handle all of
the mathematical complexity that could be included if scientists tried to model
everything they know about how the climate system works. So, a hierarchy of models has been created, with the most sophisticated of those being general circulation
models (GCMs). There are both atmospheric-GCMs and ocean-GCMs, which can
be coupled together to form an atmospheric-ocean coupled general circulation
model (AOGCM). As GCMs have evolved in complexity, they have gotten better
and better at matching the historical record, which adds confidence in their predictions for the future. A complete global climate model would couple an AOGCM
with a land model, a sea-ice model, and models for aerosols, carbon cycle, vegetation dynamics, and atmospheric chemistry.
A 3D (actually 4D if you include time) atmospheric general circulation model
is based on a cartesian grid in which the atmosphere is divided into cells, such as
are shown in Figure 37. For the ECHAM5/MPI-OM coupled atmosphere-ocean

model used at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Germany, the cells have
a horizontal resolution of approximately 200 km with 31 vertical levels. Their ocean
GCM has regionally varying horizontal resolution between approximately 10 km
and 150 km. Each cell is characterized by a number of variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, cloudiness, and so forth. Those cells then communicate
(mathematically) with adjacent atmospheric cells and are updated with some specified time increment. A grid coupling of atmosphere, ocean, and land models is shown
in Figure 38.

Global Mean Temperature Simulations
After having run simulations for accumulating concentrations of carbon dioxide
and other greenhouse gases, GCMS attempt to predict future global climate responses. A major uncertainty introduced at this stage of modeling is properly estimating the appropriate climate sensitivity factor, ¢T2X (the change in mean global
temperature resulting from a doubling of the equivalent CO2 concentration above
its preindustrial level).
The IPCC has often used three possible values of climate sensitivity, 1.5°C,
2.5°C, and 4.5°C, but a more recent approach has been based on trying to use a
probability density function (pdf) and its accompanying cumulative probability distribution to help quantify the uncertainty in this key parameter. Figure 39 shows
two such probability estimates. One (labeled WR, after its author’s initials), is based
on a log-normal fit to the long-stated IPCC 90 percent probability range for ¢T2X of
1.5°C to 4.5°C. The WR pdf has a median ¢T2X probability of 2.6°C and indicates
a 10 percent chance that it is greater than 4°C. The other (labeled AS) has a median

be able to avoid dangerous climate changes in the future.

Figure 40 shows simulations of global average surface temperature for the
six SRES scenarios. According to these 2007 simulations, a mean global warming
between 2.4° and 4.4°C relative to mid-nineteenth-century levels is likely. Anywhere
within that range would make the planet warmer than it has been for hundreds of
thousands of years.

Dangerous Anthropogenic Interference with Climate
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change calls for the “stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would
prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference (DAI) with the climate system”
(UNFCC, 1992). Note the difference between stabilizing the rate at which carbon is
emitted and stabilizing its concentration in the atmosphere. In fact, with a constant
carbon emission rate at the current level, the equivalent carbon dioxide level would
likely be double the preindustrial concentration of 280 ppm by 2100. Moreover,
even if we stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, it will
take decades for the climate system to adjust to its new equilibrium temperature.
One way to begin thinking about dangerous climate change is to outline the
sorts of impacts that global warming could have. The IPCC has done that, and their
list of likely impacts in the relatively short term includes more frequent heat waves
such as the one experienced in Europe in 2003, responsible for 35,000 deaths; more
frequent intense storms like Katrina in 2005, leading to more extreme flooding and a
surge in property damage; drier summers and increased risk of severe droughts with
accompanying loss of farm productivity, especially in mid-latitude areas such as the

Mediterranean, Central America, and Southern Africa; less snow and reduced glacial extent, impacting areas that rely on snowmelt for water supply such as China,
India, and Peru; sea-level rise and increased risk of coastal flooding that would displace millions of people in areas such as China, Bangladesh, and Egypt; and increasing ocean acidity as carbon dioxide is absorbed and converted to carbonic acid,
leading to widespread impacts on marine ecosystems and biodiversity.
In the longer term, future warming could cause large-scale, potentially rapid
and nonlinear climate responses, including the deglaciation of polar ice sheets, such
as those in Greenland and West Antarctica, which could lead to several meters of sea
level rise above that already expected due to thermal expansion of the oceans. Some
climate changes could be nonlinear, producing responses that cause the climate system to jump from one stable state to another, as would occur if the North Atlantic
thermohaline circulation system were to collapse (more on this later).
The question then arises as to how likely those impacts will become as a function of global temperatures increases. We have already seen the introduction of probability density functions in the context of the climate sensitivity factor. Some have
tried to link probabilities to avoiding dangerous anthropogenic interference with
climate. One such study shown in Figure 41 combines a number of assessments of the
likelihood of exceeding the 2°C temperature rise thought to be capable of everything
from widespread coral bleaching to disintegration of the Greenland ice sheet and perhaps a collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet. As shown, a number of studies suggest
that the stabilized CO2-eq concentration needs to remain below about 450–500 ppm
for the odds to be in favor of not exceeding a 2°C temperature rise.

FIGURE 41 Estimated risks of exceeding a 2°C global mean temperature rise depending on
the stabilized equivalent-CO2 concentration. For example, if CO2-eq stabilizes at 550 ppm
(doubling of preindustrialized levels), the risk of overshooting a 2°C warming appears to be
above 70 percent. Dotted and dashed lines correspond to different studies.

11 Stabilizing Greenhouse Gases
The warning provided by studies of the likelihood of dangerous anthropogenic interference with climate increases our awareness of the need for mitigation strategies to
help control greenhouse gas emissions. Since greenhouse gases accumulate in the
atmosphere, to stabilize their concentration, we must do more than simply hold their
emission rates constant. They need to be reduced to the point where their rate of
addition to the atmosphere equals the rate at which they are removed. Figure 42
shows how emissions would have to decrease for the atmospheric concentration of
CO2 to stabilize at various levels. Notice avoiding dangerous anthropogenic interference would require emissions to start declining within the next 30 to 40 years.
Figure 43 suggests mitigation approaches that can contribute to reducing
fossil-fuel carbon dioxide emissions. It consists of a reference emission scenario as a

starting point, a target emission rate that would lead to the goal of climate stabilization, and an array of mitigation techniques that could be used to achieve that stabilization goal. Approaches to mitigation of carbon dioxide include demand reduction by
increasing the efficiency with which we use energy and/or structural changes in the
economy (e.g., a shift from manufacturing to a more service-oriented economy); fuel
switching, which includes shifting from one fossil fuel to another (e.g., coal to natural
gas) as well as increasing generation from nonfossil-fuel sources (e.g., nuclear, wind,
solar, biomass, geothermal, and hydro); and sequestration, which includes carbon capture and storage (CCS) at power plants as well as increased sequestration in biomass.
An intuitively persuasive way to frame the problem of controlling future carbon emissions was introduced by Pacala and Socolow (2004). The concept is simple.
Their reference scenario is in essence a 50-year projection of current carbon emission growth rates from 7 GtC/yr in 2005 to 14 GtC/yr in 2055, which makes it quite
similar to the SRES B2 scenario. Their mitigation goal is to at least hold emissions
constant at 7 Gt/yr over that 50-year period. To do so would require the elimination
of 175 GtC of emissions over the next 50 years, which is the area of the emissions
stabilization triangle shown in Figure 44.
As shown in Figure 45, they then proceed to break that emissions triangle into
seven stabilization wedges, with each wedge having the ability to eliminate 1 GtC/yr
in 2055. The Princeton Carbon Mitigation Initiative is in the process of identifying
a significant number of strategies already available that could reduce emissions
equivalent to one wedge of carbon emissions if deployed on a large scale. Their list
includes the following:
Double the fuel efficiency of every automobile by 2050.
Drive half as many miles.
Utilize the best efficiency practices for all residential and commercial buildings.
Double the efficiency of coal-fired power plants.
Using natural gas instead of coal at 1,400 power plants.

Use 4 million wind turbines to produce hydrogen fuel.

Increase hydrogen fuel production from fossil-fuel sources by a factor of 10.

Every one of these options is already available on a commercial scale. Full
deployment of seven of them offers the enticing potential to at least stabilize emissions over the next half century. Realize, of course, that stabilizing emissions does
not stabilize the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and to avoid
dangerous anthropogenic interference with our climate system, we must do much
better than that.

12 The Oceans and Climate Change
The oceans cover 70 percent of the Earth’s surface and contain over 97 percent of the
Earth’s water. They have high heat capacity, so they warm slowly, and their currents
distribute heat around the globe, greatly affecting local and regional temperatures on
the land. They store 50 times as much carbon as the atmosphere, and they exchange
carbon dioxide back and forth across the atmosphere-ocean interface at a rate that
dwarfs the contribution by humankind. In other words, the oceans significantly
affect and are affected by climate change. Greenhouse enhancement can affect the

568

Global Atmospheric Change

ocean in many ways, but three of the most important changes have to do with ocean
acidification, rising sea levels, and changes in the ocean circulation. In addition,
biological processes that result in the removal of carbon from the atmosphere can be
affected by climate change, and in turn, those changes can affect climate.

Ocean Acidification
The oceans are performing a great service to the climate system by absorbing so
much of the carbon dioxide we continuously pump into the atmosphere. That
absorption comes at a price, however, since it is causing subtle chemical changes in
the oceans that may have enormous implications for marine ecosystems.
Dissolved inorganic carbon exists in three forms: dissolved CO2 gas, bicarbonate (HCO3- ), and carbonate (CO23 - ) ions. When CO2 dissolves into sea water, some
of it creates carbonic acid (H2CO3), which in turn ionizes to form hydrogen and
bicarbonate:
CO2 + H2O 3 H2CO3 3 H + + HCO3The bicarbonate ions
carbonate ions:

(HCO3- ),

(44)

in turn, ionize to some extent into hydrogen and

HCO3- 3 H + + CO23 -

(45)

The natural pH of the oceans is between 8.0 and 8.3, which means it is somewhat
alkaline. The preceding reactions release hydrogen ions, which make the water more
acidic (less alkaline) as CO2 absorption increases. Studies have shown that the oceans
have already experienced a drop in pH of about 0.1 since preindustrial times, and it
seems likely ocean pH will fall by another 0.3 by the year 2100 (Caldeira and
Wickett, 2003). If that happens, the oceans will be more acidic than they have been
for hundreds of millions of years.
The preceding reactions proceed in both directions, and the resulting balance of
aqueous CO2, bicarbonate, and carbonate ions is a function of the pH (Figure 46).
As Figure 46 shows, one consequence of a decrease in pH is that carbonate
decreases as well. And carbonate is needed to build the calcium carbonate (CaCO3)

Global Atmospheric Change

in shells and other hard parts of marine organisms. Some of the most important
organisms likely to be affected by a lack of carbonate are certain types of plankton
and small marine snails that are a major source of food for fish and marine mammals, including some species of whales. Coral reefs would also be affected since they
are built from secretions of calcium carbonate by small sea anemone-like animals and
coralline algae, which colonize and literally create the reefs.
Another impact of the drop in carbonate ions in seawater is the increased
potential for shells to literally dissolve. The balance between the rate at which solid
calcium carbonate dissociates and the rate at which it is formed is related to the concentration of carbonate ions:
CaCO3 3 Ca2 + + CO32 -

(46)

With less carbonate, the reaction shifts to the right, increasing the tendency for
calcium carbonate to dissolve. The dissociation constant that goes with (46) is temperature and pressure dependent, and in cold, deep waters, the shift is sufficient to
dissolve calcium carbonate shells. There is a depth, called the saturation horizon,
below which shells dissolve and above which they survive. With more atmospheric
CO2, the shift in pH and carbonate has caused the saturation horizons to shift closer
to the surface, in some areas by as much as 50 to 200 meters compared to where
they were in the 1800s. Thinning of the shell-friendly, upper layer of the oceans,
with unknown consequences, is a rising concern for climate and marine scientists
trying to predict the impacts of global warming.

Rising Sea Level
Water expands as it warms, decreasing its density and increasing its volume, which
causes sea level to rise. In addition, melting glaciers and ice caps contribute to
increasing ocean volume and rising sea levels. Thermal expansion is the primary
cause of the current 3 mm per year rise in sea level, but melting glaciers have the
potential to accelerate that rise substantially in the future.
Almost all of the world’s nonoceanic water is stored in ice caps and glaciers,
and almost all of that is contained in just two great ice sheets—the Antarctic ice
sheet and the Greenland ice sheet. Table 9 shows the volume of ice in these ice sheets
plus the remaining ice stored in glaciers and ice caps along with the equivalent rise
in sea level that complete melting could incur. As shown there, the Antarctic ice
sheet stores enough water to raise the level of the oceans by 73 meters.
The Antarctic ice sheet is projected to grow slightly in the future due to
increased precipitation coupled with extremely cold temperatures, so it may not

contribute to rising sea levels. A portion of Antarctic ice, however, rests on the ocean
floor, and there has been some concern that if that West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIC)
were to break loose and slide into the ocean, it could cause a rapid rise in sea level
of perhaps 5 or 6 meters. Indeed, a 200-m thick, 3,200 km2 chunk of the Larsen Ice
Shelf did collapse into the sea in 2002, amplifying concern that ocean warming and
the acceleration of ice flows may be destabilizing the ice sheet that could cause a
runaway discharge into the oceans. Some studies indicate a critical threshold for
WAIC collapse might be in the range of a 2°C to 5°C global temperature rise, but
too many uncertainties remain to be confident that this is an accurate estimate.
Inland portions of the Greenland ice sheet have shown a slight increase in volume, but significant melting is occurring along the coasts. Meltwater seeping down
through the crevices of the melting ice seems to be acting as a lubricant that is accelerating glacial movement toward the ocean. There is great concern for a potential
tipping point, beyond which the surface temperature of the ice sheet will become too
warm to allow winter glacial growth to offset summertime melting. At that point,
which is estimated by some to be a 2 to 3°C mean global temperature increase above
preindustrial levels, the Greenland ice sheet will begin to melt irreversibly.
Atmospheric-ocean coupled general circulation models have been used to estimate future sea-level change for a great many SRES scenarios. For the illustrative
A1B and B2 scenarios shown in Figure 47, a sea level rise on the order of one quarter
of a meter by 2100 is projected. Multiple variations on all of the SRES scenarios
show much wider variation, with most lying somewhere between 0.2 to 0.7 meters in
2100. The enormous thermal capacitance of the oceans means that sea level will continue to rise well beyond the time when carbon dioxide concentrations stabilize in the
atmosphere as the oceans slowly adjust to the increased radiative forcing.
Rising sea levels coupled with the projected increase in the fraction of hurricanes
and storms that are predicted to be highly dangerous may result in large areas of
densely populated coastline having to be abandoned. With approximately 20 percent

of the world’s population living within 30 km of a coastline, tens of millions of people
may become climate change refugees. Damage due to storm surges could be devastating to coastal areas that have not been adequately fortified, which places an added
burden on countries that don’t have the resources to adapt to rising water levels.
Hurricane Katrina (Figure 48), which slammed into the Gulf Coast in 2005, provided
a stark example of how costly, both in terms of human lives (over 1,800 deaths) and
property damage (over $80 billion), storm events can be. Other potential impacts of
rising sea levels include increased shoreline erosion, exacerbated coastal flooding, inundation of coastal wetlands, and increased salinity of estuaries and aquifers.

Thermohaline Circulation and the Biological Carbon Pump
Atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed by the oceans and forms inorganic dissolved bicarbonate and carbonate ions. A small fraction of that carbon is taken up
by phytoplankton during photosynthesis and becomes part of the food chain in the
upper layer of the oceans (the euphotic zone). Photosynthesis, respiration, and
decomposition taking place in the surface layers of the ocean remove and replace
some 40 to 50 GtC per year. There is a net removal, however, of about 10 GtC per
year (nearly twice the carbon emission rate from the combustion of fossil fuels) from
the surface waters as dissolved organic carbon, particulate carbon, and CaCO3 in
the “hard” parts of marine algae and animals sink into the intermediate and deep
ocean. That removal process is known as the biological carbon pump.
Related to the biological pump is another process called the thermohaline circulation system, or sometimes the Atlantic conveyor, that transports carbon-rich
surface waters into the deep oceans. As shown in Figure 49, there is an enormous

FIGURE 49 The thermohaline circulation system is driven by cold, salty water sinking into

flow of ocean water around the globe, equal to the combined flow of all the world’s
rivers, that transports heat and nutrients from one place to another. Relatively warm
seawater near the surface flows into the North Atlantic, where winds encourage
evaporation and help sweep the surface waters aside, allowing the warm subsurface
water to rise. That rising warm water gives off an enormous amount of heat as it
reaches the surface. It is this source of heat that accounts for Western Europe’s relatively mild winters. As that warm surface water evaporates and cools, it becomes
more salty and dense, eventually becoming so dense that it sinks down to the ocean
bottom. That North Atlantic deep water then moves southward, around the southern tip of Africa. Some emerges off the coast of India, but most upwells in the Pacific
ocean where it starts its path back to the North Atlantic.
What makes the thermohaline circulation especially important in studies of climate change is the fact that it appears to have several stable states. It runs at a fast
rate, an extremely slow rate, or at its present rate, which is somewhere in the middle. The transition between those stable states can occur in a relatively few years.
Shifting from one stable state to another is thought to be responsible for a rather
dramatic climate shift that occurred in northern Europe just after the last glacial
period ended. Some 11,000 years ago, while glaciers were retreating and temperatures
were back to interglacial levels, northern Europe and northeastern North America
suddenly plunged back into glacial conditions. The temperature in Greenland
dropped by 6°C in less than 100 years, stayed that way for 1,000 years, then jumped
back to warm conditions in about 20 years (Broeker and Denton, 1990). The explanation for this event, known as the Younger Dryas (named for an Arctic flower that
grew in Europe during this period), is based on the sudden stopping, then restarting

573

Global Atmospheric Change

1,000 years later, of the Atlantic conveyor. Apparently, glacial meltwater draining
from the North American ice sheet into the North Atlantic diluted the salty surface
water enough to halt the density-driven dive into the abyss, which stopped the entire
conveyor. Europe lost the warming influence of the current, and glacial conditions
suddenly returned.
Most coupled ocean-atmosphere models show a future decrease in the strength
of the Atlantic conveyor, which on its own would lead to some cooling of Europe and
the east coast of the United States. That cooling would offset some but not all of the
projected regional warming that would otherwise be expected due to an enhanced
greenhouse effect. The possibility of a complete collapse of thermohaline circulation
that could result if precipitation and runoff patterns change sufficiently is another of
the potential “surprises” that worry some climatologists.

13 Changes in Stratospheric Ozone
The changes occurring in the stratosphere’s protective layer of ozone are closely
linked to the greenhouse problem just discussed. Many of the same gases are
involved, including CFCs, halons, methane, and nitrous oxide, as well as aerosols
and ozone itself. Some of the gases that enhance the greenhouse effect, such as
methane, actually reduce stratospheric ozone depletion, so the two problems really
must be considered together.
Ozone has the unusual characteristic of being beneficial when it is in the stratosphere protecting us from exposure to ultraviolet radiation, while ozone formed
near the ground in photochemical smog reactions is harmful to humans and other
living things. About 90 percent of the atmosphere’s ozone is contained in the stratosphere between roughly 10 and 50 km in what is commonly referred to as the ozone
layer. The remaining 10 percent or so is contained in the troposphere, near the
ground, above cities and industrialized areas. Figure 50 shows this distribution of
ozone in the atmosphere along with some comments on its beneficial and harmful
attributes.
If all of the atmospheric ozone overhead at any given spot on the Earth were to
be brought down to ground level so that it would be subjected to 1 atm of pressure,
it would form a layer only a few millimeters thick. In fact, one of the common methods of expressing the total amount of ozone overhead is in terms of Dobson units
(DU), where 1 DU is equivalent to a layer of ozone 0.01 mm thick at 1 atm of pressure at 0°C. At midlatitudes, the ozone overhead is typically about 350 DU (3.5 mm
at 1 atm); near the equator, it is closer to 250 DU. During the annual appearance of
the ozone hole over Antarctica, the ozone column drops below 100 DU.

The Ultraviolet (UV) Portion of the Solar Spectrum
Ozone (O3) is continuously being created in the stratosphere by photochemical
reactions powered by short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV) radiation, while at the same
time it is continuously being removed by other photochemical reactions that convert
it back to diatomic oxygen molecules (O2). The rates of creation and removal at any
given time and location dictate the concentrations of ozone present.

The energy required to drive some of these photochemical reactions comes
from sunlight penetrating the atmosphere. As you may recall, it is convenient to
consider such electromagnetic radiation in some contexts as a wave phenomenon
and in others as a packet of energy called a photon. The energy content of a single
photon is the proportional to its frequency, and inversely proportional to its wavelength:

wavelength (m)

Thus, photons with shorter wavelengths have higher energy content.
The entire solar spectrum was introduced in Figure 10, where it was used to
help derive the effective temperature of the Earth. In the context of stratospheric
ozone depletion, however, it is only the UV portion of the spectrum that is of interest. Photons associated with those shorter wavelengths can have sufficient energy to
break apart molecules, initiating photochemical reactions. Molecules that are dissociated by UV light are said to have undergone photolysis.
The energy required to drive photochemical reactions is often expressed as an
amount of energy per mole of gas under standard conditions. If we assume the energy required under stratospheric conditions is not much different, we can easily derive

575

Global Atmospheric Change

the maximum wavelength that a photon must have to cause photolysis. A single photon (with sufficient energy) can cause photolysis in one molecule. And since there are
Avogadro’s number (6.02 * 1023) of molecules in one mole of gas, we can convert
energy needed per mole into the energy that one photon must have, as follows:
E(J/photon) =

E(J/mol)
1 photon/molecule * 6.02 * 1023 molecule/mol

(48)

Now we can use (47) to solve for the wavelength.

495 kJ/mol * 103 J/kJ

= 8.22 * 10 - 19 J/photon

1 photon/molecule * 6.02 * 1023 molecule/mol

Rearranging (46) and substituting the energy that the photon must have gives us

Thus, photons with wavelengths longer than 241.6 nm will not have sufficient
energy to break apart the oxygen molecule.
The wavelengths that are most important in the context of stratospheric ozone
depletion are in the 100 to 400 nm portion of the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum. It is
called ultraviolet since wavelengths just above 400 nm are violet in color and visible
to the human eye. For analogous reasons, wavelengths above 700 are called
infrared, since 700 nm is the edge of the red portion of the visible spectrum. The
most important portion of the UV spectrum is divided into three regions, designated
as UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C, which have wavelengths as shown in Figure 51.

Global Atmospheric Change

About 99 percent of the incoming solar UV that makes it through the atmosphere is UV-A (320 to 400 nm). It is sometimes referred to as “black light” since it
is invisible to the human eye, though some animals can use it for vision. UV-A penetrates deeply into human skin, causing tanning (but little skin reddening), DNA
damage, photoaging (toughening of the skin, wrinkles), and possibly skin cancer.
Some exposure to UV-A benefits human health by helping to induce the formation
of vitamin D. UV-B radiation (280–320 nm) poses the greatest danger to human
health. It causes reddening of the skin (erythema) and reduction of vitamin-D synthesis in the short term; in the long term, it is a cause of skin cancer, cataracts, and
suppression of the immune system. The “SPF rating” of sunscreen products refers to
their ability to protect us from UV-B. Some sunscreens now include ingredients
that also help block UV-A. Photons within the UV-C portion of the spectrum (100 to
280 nm) readily destroy DNA, which makes them extremely dangerous but also lets
artificially created UV-C be used as a very effective disinfectant for water treatment
and other germicidal applications. Fortunately, the atmosphere effectively shields us
from these very potent photons.

The Ozone Layer as a Protective Shield
Ozone formation in the stratosphere can be described by the following pair of reactions. In the first, atomic oxygen (O) is formed by the photolytic decomposition of
diatomic oxygen (O2).
O2 + hn : O + O

(49)

where hn represents a photon. As shown in Example 13, for this dissociation to take
place, the photon must have a wavelength of no more than 242 nanometers.
Photons with less energy (longer wavelengths) cannot cause the reaction to take
place; all they can do is heat up the molecule that absorbs them. Photons with higher energy than the minimum required use some of their energy to cause photolysis,
and what is left over is dissipated as heat. Diatomic oxygen (O2) has its maximum
absorption at about 140 nm, and it is a very effective absorber of UV-C radiation
between 130 and 180 nm.
The atomic oxygen formed by (49) reacts rapidly with diatomic oxygen to
form ozone,
O + O2 + M : O3 + M

(50)

where M represents a third body (usually a nearby N2 molecule) needed to carry
away the heat generated in the reaction.
Opposing the preceding ozone formation process is ozone removal by photodissociation:
O3 + hn : O2 + O

(51)

The absorptance of ozone extends from about 200 to 320 nm and reaches its
peak at 255 nm. The reaction shown in (51) is very effective in removing UV-C
radiation and some of the UV-B before it reaches the Earth’s surface.
The preceding combination of reactions (49 to 51) forms a chain in which oxygen atoms are constantly being shuttled back and forth between the various
molecular forms. A principal effect is the absorption of most of the short-wavelength,
potentially damaging, UV radiation as it tries to pass through the stratosphere.

In addition, that absorption also heats the stratosphere, causing the temperature inversion shown earlier in Figure 1. That temperature inversion, which is what defines
the stratosphere, produces stable atmospheric conditions that lead to long residence
times for stratospheric pollutants.
The effectiveness of these reactions in removing short-wavelength UV is demonstrated in Figure 52, in which the extraterrestrial solar flux and the flux actually
reaching the Earth’s surface are shown. The radiation reaching the surface has been
drawn for a clear day with the sun assumed to be 60° from the zenith (overhead),
corresponding roughly to a typical mid-latitude site in the afternoon. As can be seen,
the radiation reaching the Earth’s surface is rapidly reduced for wavelengths less than
about 320 nm. In fact, an intact ozone layer shields us from almost all of the UV
having wavelengths shorter than about 290 nm.

Catalytic Destruction of Stratospheric Ozone
As is now common knowledge, the natural formation and destruction of ozone in
the stratosphere is being affected by gases that we release into the atmosphere. In
particular, ozone destruction is enhanced by catalytic reactions that can be represented as follows:
and
for a net

X + O3 : XO + O2
XO + O : X + O2
O + O3 : 2 O2

(52)

where X is a free radical such as Cl, Br, H, OH, or NO (recall that free radicals are
highly reactive atoms or molecules that have an odd number of electrons, which
means one electron is not paired with another atom). Notice in (52) how the X
radical that enters the first reaction is released in the second, freeing it to go on
and participate in another catalytic cycle. The net result of the preceding pair of

578

Global Atmospheric Change

reactions is the destruction of one ozone molecule. The original catalyst that started
the reactions, however, may go on to destroy thousands more ozone molecules
before it eventually leaves the stratosphere.
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are a major source of ozone-destroying chlorine.
Recall that CFCs have long atmospheric lifetimes since they are inert and nonwatersoluble, so they aren’t removed in the troposphere by chemical reactions or rainfall.
Eventually, CFCs drift into the stratosphere, where they are exposed to UV radiation, which breaks apart the molecules, freeing the chlorine. CFCs typically require
photons in the UV-C range with wavelengths shorter than 220 nm for photolysis.
For example, CFC-12, which has an atmospheric lifetime of 100 years (Table 7),
undergoes photolysis as follows:
CF2Cl2 + UV-C : CF2Cl + Cl

(53)

Eventually the second chlorine atom is also released. The freed chlorine then acts as
a catalyst as described by (52):

Net:

Cl + O3 : ClO + O2
ClO + O : Cl + O2
O + O3 : 2 O2

(54)

The chlorine atom makes this loop tens of thousands of times, but eventually it
reacts with methane to become water-soluble HCl that can diffuse into the troposphere, where it can be washed out of the atmosphere by rainfall.
Cl + CH4 : HCl + CH3

(55)

Chlorine that has been incorporated into HCl, as in (55), is inactive; that is, it
does not participate in the catalytic destruction of ozone represented by (54).
Notice that methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas, helps remove the ozonedestroying, active form of chlorine from the stratosphere. In the context of climate
change, methane is part of the problem; in the context of ozone depletion, it is part
of the cure.
Another way that chlorine is removed from the catalytic chain reaction is by
its incorporation into chlorine nitrate, ClONO2:
ClO + NO2 : ClONO2

(56)

At any given time, as much as 99 percent of the chlorine in the stratosphere is tied up
in these inactive molecules, HCl and ClONO2. Unfortunately, those inactive molecules are subject to chemical reactions and photolysis that can restore the chlorine
to its active forms, Cl and ClO, especially when there are nearby particles available
that provide platforms upon which the reactions can take place. Sulfate aerosols,
especially from volcanic eruptions, and clouds of nitric acid ice over the Antarctic
provide such surfaces. When gases and particles are both involved, the chemistry is
referred to as heterogeneous reactions, as opposed to homogeneous reactions involving gases alone.
Bromine in the stratosphere is another potent ozone-depleting gas, as the
following reactions suggest:
Br + O3 : BrO + O2
BrO + ClO : Br + ClO2

(57)

579

Global Atmospheric Change

As is the case with chlorine, bromine acts as a catalyst destroying ozone until it eventually combines with methane to form hydrogen bromide (HBr). Hydrogen bromide
deactivates the bromine, but not for long. Photolysis rather quickly decomposes HBr,
sending bromine back into its catalytic loop with ozone. In this regard, bromine is
much more potent than chlorine since stratospheric chlorine exists mostly in its
inactive forms, HCl and ClONO2.
The main source of bromine in the stratosphere is methyl bromide (CH3Br),
about half of which comes from the oceans, and about half is due to anthropogenic
sources. Methyl bromide is used extensively in agriculture to sterilize soil and fumigate some crops after they are harvested. Other anthropogenic sources include biomass burning and automobile exhaust emissions when leaded fuels are used.
Bromine has also been used as a flame retardent in fire extinguishers.

The Antarctic Ozone Hole
Chlorine that has been incorporated into hydrogen chloride (HCl) or chlorine
nitrate (ClONO2) is inactive, so it doesn’t contribute to the destruction of ozone. In
the Antarctic winter, however, a unique atmospheric condition known as the polar
vortex traps air above the pole and creates conditions that eventually allow the chlorine to be activated. The polar vortex consists of a whirling mass of extremely cold
air that forms over the South Pole during the period of total darkness in the
Antarctic winter. The vortex effectively isolates the air above the pole from the rest
of the atmosphere until the Antarctic spring arrives in September. Stratospheric temperatures in the vortex may drop to below -90°C, which is cold enough to form
polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) even though the air is very dry. The ice crystals
that make up polar clouds play a key role in the Antarctic phenomenon by providing reaction surfaces that allow chemical species to stay together long enough to
react with each other.
A number of reactions take place on the surfaces of polar stratospheric cloud
particles that result in the formation of chlorine gas (Cl2). For example,
ClONO2 + H2O : HOCl + HNO3

(58)

HOCl + HCl : Cl2 + H2O

(59)

ClONO2 + HCl : Cl2 + HNO3

(60)

Once the sun rises in the Antarctic spring in September, the chlorine gas (Cl2)
formed during the darkness of winter photolytically decomposes into atomic
chlorine:
Cl2 + hn : 2 Cl

(61)

which then destroys ozone by reinitiating the catalytic destruction process described
in (54):
(Cl + O3 : ClO + O2) + (ClO + O : Cl + O2) = O + O3 : 2 O2

(62)

The destruction of ozone as the sun first appears in the Antarctic spring proceeds as
described until the nitric acid (HNO3) formed in (58) and (60) photolyzes and
forms inactive chlorine nitrate (ClONO2), which stops the ozone destruction
process. As the vortex breaks down in the spring, ozone from nearby areas rushes in

and replenishes the ozone above Antarctica. Conversely, the transport of ozonedepleted air from polar regions is thought to be contributing to decreases in stratospheric ozone at middle latitudes. The entire ozone-hole cycle typically lasts from
mid-August until the end of November, reaching its greatest depth and aerial extent
near the first of October.
Concern over possible destruction of stratospheric ozone was first expressed
by two scientists, F. Sherwood Rowland and Mario J. Molina in 1974; however, it
wasn’t until 1985, with the dramatic announcement of the discovery of a “hole” in
the ozone over Antarctica, that the world began to recognize the seriousness of the
problem. In 1995, Rowland, Molina, and Paul Crutzen were awarded the Nobel
Prize in Chemistry for their pioneering work in explaining the chemical processes
that lead to the destruction of stratospheric ozone.
Figure 53 shows how deep the ozone hole has been over the past couple of
decades. The values shown (in Dobson units) correspond to the minimum values
measured anywhere within the hole each year. When measurements first began, in
the early 1980s, those minimums were a little above 200 DU. They reached their
lowest level in 1995 (88 DU) and now seem to be somewhat on the rise as efforts to
control emissions of ozone-depleting substances begin to have effect. The area of the
ozone hole has shown a similar pattern to the depth (Figure 54). The hole grows in
area to about 25 million km2 in late September, making it roughly equivalent in size
to the entire North American continent.
The very low stratospheric temperatures over Antarctica, which form those
polar stratospheric clouds, are not duplicated in the Arctic. The combination of land
and ocean areas in the Arctic results in warmer temperatures and much less of a
polar vortex, factors that do not encourage the formation of polar clouds. The result
is a much less dramatic thinning of the ozone layer over the Arctic in the spring,
although it is still significant. There is concern, however, that greenhouse effect

enhancement could lead to stratospheric cooling, which would make an Arctic
ozone hole more likely. Should an extensive ozone hole develop in the Northern
Hemisphere, far more people would be exposed to elevated UV radiation.

Ozone Depletion Potential (ODPs)
The concept of Ozone Depletion Potentials (ODPs) for ozone-depleting substances
(ODSs) is analogous to the Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) for greenhouse gases
already described. In the case of ODPs, the reference gas is CFC-11 (CFCl3). The
ODP of a gas is defined as the change in total ozone per unit mass emission of
the gas, relative to the change in total ozone per unit mass emission of CFC-11.
Notice the definition of ODPs is independent of the length of time required for the
depletion to take place, so, in that sense, they are somewhat different from timedependent GWPs.
ODPs have become an integral part of the regulatory approach to controlling
emissions of ozone-depleting substances. The Montreal Protocol on Substances
that Deplete the Ozone Layer and its subsequent Amendments, which governs
international production and use of halocarbons, and the U.S. Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, which controls domestic uses, both dictate the phase-out of
ozone-depleting substances based on their Ozone Depletion Potentials.
Table 10 lists ODPs for a number of CFCs, halons, and possible replacements. By definition, CFC-11 has an ODP of 1.0, which is the highest ODP of any
of the CFCs. Halons-1211 and 1301 have much higher ODPs than CFC-11 due to
the higher reactivity of bromine and the reduced effectiveness of deactivation traps

compared with chlorine. Notice the replacement HCFCs have low ODPs, typically
less than 0.1, which is a reflection of their short atmospheric lifetimes.
For comparison, 100-year GWPs relative to CFC-11 rather than the usual
CO2 reference molecule have been added to Table 10. These GWPs tell us that the
HCFC and HFC replacements for CFCs are not only much better in terms of ozone
depletion, but they also cause considerably less global warming. The halons, on the
other hand, tend to be worse than CFCs in both categories.

Impacts of Increased Exposure to UV
The biological response to increased ultraviolet radiation is often represented by an
action spectrum. The action spectrum provides a quantitative way to express the relative ability of various wavelengths to cause biological harm. For example, the
action spectra for plant damage, DNA damage, and erythema (skin reddening) are
shown in Figure 55a. All of these spectra show increasing damage as wavelength decreases, and they all show significant damage in the UV-B (280 to 320 nm) region.
There are some differences, however. Plants, for example, show no damage from
wavelengths above about 320 nm, but erythema damage occurs well into the UV-A
(320 to 400 nm) portion of the solar spectrum. Sunscreens that block UV-B, but not
UV-A, can give a false sense of security by allowing people to spend more time
exposed to the sun without burning, but skin damage that may lead to skin cancer is
occurring nonetheless.
By combining wavelength-dependent action spectra, such as are shown in
Figure 55a, with ground-level solar irradiances, a biological weighted effectiveness
of radiation is obtained. Figure 55b shows a representative action spectrum superimposed on two solar irradiance curves—one showing irradiance with an intact
ozone layer (dotted line), and the other with an ozone layer that has been thinned
somewhat (solid line). As the ozone column is depleted, the irradiance in those

critical short UV-B wavelengths, where organisms are most sensitive, rises rapidly,
as does the potential biological damage. The biologically weighted irradiance
shows the critical wavelengths in terms of biological damage between about 290
and 310 nm (UV-B). Shorter wavelengths are effectively blocked by the remaining
ozone layer, while longer wavelengths do little biological damage.
Most of our concern for increasing exposure to UV radiation has focused on
the increased probability of developing skin cancer. Numerous studies have shown
that skin cancer is readily induced in laboratory animals exposed to broad spectrum
UV radiation, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (1992) states
unequivocally that “there is sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of
solar radiation. Solar radiation causes cutaneous malignant melanoma and nonmelanocytic skin cancer.” In fact, exposure to solar radiation is probably the main
cause of all forms of skin cancer and an important, if not the main, cause of cancer
of the lip (Armstrong, 1993).
Skin cancer is usually designated as being either the more common nonmelanoma (basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas), or the much more lifethreatening malignant melanoma. Epidemiological studies directly link skin cancer
rates with exposure to UV-B. At lower latitudes, there is more surface-level UV-B, and
skin cancer rates increase proportionately. Using such data, it has been estimated that
a 1 percent increase in UV-B is estimated to cause a 0.5 percent increase in the incidence rate of melanoma and a 2.5 percent increase in nonmelanoma (Armstrong,
1993). Both types of skin cancer are more prevalent among people with fair complexion than among individuals who have more of the protective pigment, melanin.
Nonmelanoma is most likely to occur on areas of the skin habitually receiving
greatest exposure to the sun, such as the head and neck. While it is rarely fatal, it

584

Global Atmospheric Change

often causes disfigurement. Melanomas, on the other hand, are as common on
intermittently exposed parts of the body, such as the trunk and legs, as they are on
the head and neck. Melanomas seem to occur more frequently on individuals who
have had severe and repeated sunburns in childhood. This observation has led to a
hypothesis that melanoma is less related to the accumulated dose of radiation, as
seems to be the case for nonmelanoma, than it is to the pattern of exposure.
The incidence rate of melanoma among fair skinned individuals in the United
States is increasing at 2 to 3 percent annually, which is faster than any other form
of cancer. In 1935, the lifetime risk of an American developing melanoma was 1
in 1,500 individuals, while in 2002 the risk was 1 in 68. Approximately 54,000
melanomas are diagnosed each year, and 7,600 die of the disease. While some are
tempted to relate that increase to the thinning of the ozone layer, it is much more
likely to be the result of lifestyle changes rather than increased surface-level UV irradiation. More people are simply spending more time outdoors in the sun than in the
past. Moreover, the decrease in stratospheric ozone is a relatively recent phenomenon, and evidence suggests that skin cancer may have a long latency period. There
very well may be a 20-year lag time between changes in solar irradiance and measurable increases in skin cancer caused by that exposure.
To help alert the public to the dangers of UV exposure, various versions of a
simple index have been created. A UV-index is a nondimensional, single number, in
the range of 0 to 12, that represents an erythemal-weighted irradiance expected at
solar noon (when the sun is at its highest) for the following day. The UV-index is
now a routine part of Web and newspaper weather forecasts. To make the index
more appealing and understandable for the public, it is linked to descriptive words
ranging from “Low” to “Extreme,” and it also provides an estimate of the length of
time required for a fair-skinned person to get sunburned. The World Health
Organization index is shown in Table 11.
Other human health problems associated with UV exposure include ocular
damage (cataracts and retinal degeneration) and immune system suppression. The
effects of increasing UV-B radiation would not be felt by humans alone, of course.
There is considerable evidence that UV-B reduces photosynthesis and other plant
processes in terrestrial and aquatic plants. UV-B radiation is known to penetrate to
ecologically significant depths in the oceans, and besides impairing photosynthesis,
it threatens marine organisms during their critical developmental stages. For example, amphibian eggs have little protection when exposed to UV-B irradiation, and
the worldwide decline in frogs and toads, especially at high altitudes where solar
exposure is greatest, may be in part caused by our thinning ozone layer.

Political Response to the Ozone Depletion Problem
The political response to warnings of ozone depletion by the scientific community
has been unusually effective and timely. When CFCs were first created in the 1930s
they were hailed as wonder chemicals. They replaced toxic, explosive, and unstable
refrigerants and made possible the refrigeration and air conditioning luxuries that
we now take for granted.
A British scientist, James E. Lovelock (later famous for the “Gaia”), began
experimenting with CFCs in the 1970s and concluded in 1973 that essentially all of
the CFCs ever produced were still in the atmosphere. The first hint of potential
problems came with the publication of Molina and Rowland’s paper in 1974, which
warned of the danger to the stratospheric ozone layer that CFCs presented. The EPA
responded in a remarkably short period of time and banned nonessential spray-can
uses of CFCs by 1979. A few countries followed the U.S. lead, including Canada
and some of the Scandinavian countries, but most continued to manufacture and use
them without concern for the consequences. It wasn’t until the discovery of the
ozone hole over Antarctica in 1985 that the rest of the world awakened to the lurking danger. At that time, worldwide CFC use as an aerosol propellant was the
largest single source of CFC emissions.
In 1987 an international meeting convened in Montreal that led to the signing
of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. That Protocol
called for a 50 percent reduction in use of CFCs by 1999. It was soon realized, however, that the called-for reductions were inadequate, and in 1990, 93 nations convened in London and created a new timetable calling for a complete phase-out of
CFCs, most halons, and carbon tetrachloride by the year 2000. The plight of the
developing countries was recognized and their use of CFCs was extended to 2010. A
fund was established to help pay for technology transfer to enable the less-developed
countries to take advantage of proposed replacement chemicals.
The next year, 1991, Mt. Pinatubo erupted, and the ozone hole grew to record
proportions, which led to the London Amendments to the Protocol in 1992. The
phase-out of CFCs was moved up to 1996.
Meanwhile, in the United States, Title VI of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990 brought us into compliance with the London Amendment. Major provisions
include the following:

• Two categories of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) were created: Class I

•

586

chemicals are those with high ozone depletion potentials, which includes
CFCs, halons, and carbon tetrachloride, and Class II substances have lower
ODPs and include the HCFCs. Production of Class I chemicals was scheduled
to cease by 2000, while Class II chemicals are subject to an accelerated phaseout schedule that will eliminate all production and use by 2030. Exceptions
for necessary medical, aviation, safety and national security purposes, and for
export to developing countries are allowed.
Motor vehicle air conditioners received special attention since they had been
the largest single source of CFCs. CFC recycling equipment for air conditioner
servicing is required, and only certified repair persons are allowed to do the
work. CFCs must be removed from car air conditioners before they are
crushed for disposal.

Global Atmospheric Change

• Nonessential products that use ozone-depleting substances such as noise horns,
“silly string,” and some commercial photographic equipment, are banned.

• Warning labels are required for products that contain ODS such as refrigera•

tors and foam insulation.
Modifications to the Montreal Protocol that accelerate the phasing out of
ODS must be adhered to.

ODS Cl and Br

Two years later, in 1992, the Copenhagen Amendments to the Montreal Protocol
called for participating nations to move the ban of many ODSs to 1996. The EPA
responded in 1993 with an accelerated phase-out schedule. Production and imports
of halons ceased in 1994, and CFCs, methyl chloroform (1,1,1-trichloroethane), and
carbon tetrachloride ceased in 1996. Most HCFCs were eliminated by 2003, but some
will still be allowed until 2030.
Has this flurry of regulatory activity been effective? Stratospheric ozone depletion is one of those problems that cannot be reversed in a short period of time. Most
of the CFCs ever produced are still drifting around in the atmosphere and they will
be with us for decades into the future. The production cuts dictated by the Montreal
Protocol and subsequent Amendments have already stopped the steady, historical
climb in CFC atmospheric concentration. Figure 56 sums up the good news. CFC
production has stopped, though HCFCs will still be produced until 2030; the major
ozone-destroying chlorine and bromine concentrations in the stratosphere have
begun to decline; and the overall global stratospheric ozone concentration is beginning to recover. Not only have countless lives been saved, but the Montreal Protocol
has provided a model for effective international cooperation on a major global
environmental problem.

The solar flux S arriving at the outer edge of the atmosphere varies by ;3.3 percent as the
Earth moves in its orbit (reaching its greatest value in early January). By how many
degrees would the effective temperature of the Earth vary as a result?
In the article “The Climatic Effects of Nuclear War” ((Scientific American, August 1984),
the authors calculate a global energy balance corresponding to the first few months following a 5,000-megaton nuclear exchange. The resulting smoke and dust in the atmosphere absorb 75 percent of the incoming sunlight (257 W/m2), while the albedo is
reduced to 20 percent. Convective and evaporative heating of the atmosphere from the
Earth’s surface is negligible, as is the energy reflected from the Earth’s surface. The Earth’s
surface radiates 240 W/m2, all of which is absorbed by the atmosphere. Assuming that the
Earth can be modeled as a blackbody emitter as shown in Figure P9, find the following
(equilibrium) quantities:

precipitation in m3/yr (which is equal to the total water evaporated). Averaged over the
globe, what is the average annual precipitation in meters of water?
Suppose a greenhouse effect enhancement raises the surface temperature of the Earth to
291 K, melting enough snow and ice to reduce the albedo to the point where only
100 W/m2 are reflected (see Figure P12). The atmospheric window is closed somewhat so
that only 30 W/m2 now pass directly from the Earth’s surface to space. If the latent and
sensible heat transfer to the atmosphere do not change, and if incoming solar energy
absorbed by the atmosphere does not change, find the solar radiation absorbed at the

energy balance is maintained in each of the three regions (space, atmosphere, surface).
What would the atmospheric concentration of CO2 be 50 years from now if carbon emissions rise linearly from 10 GtC/yr to 16 GtC/yr over that period of time. Assume the
initial CO2 concentration is 380 ppm, and use a 40 percent airborne fraction.
Suppose atmospheric CO2 is growing at 2 ppm/yr, fossil fuel and cement emissions are
9 GtC/yr, and the airborne fraction is 38 percent. If the only other carbon emissions are
associated with land use changes, estimate their net carbon emission rate.
The United States derives about 40 percent of its energy from oil, 23 percent from coal,
and 23 percent from natural gas, with the remaining 14 percent from essentially carbonfree sources.
(a) Using LHV values for carbon intensity for each fuel, estimate the overall carbon
intensity.
(b) Suppose all of that coal is replaced with carbon-free nuclear and renewable energy
systems; what would be the new carbon intensity?
(c) Suppose that transition takes 100 years. Modeled as an exponential change, what
rate of growth in carbon intensity does that correspond to?
Using estimates of the total resource base of coal, petroleum, and natural gas given in
Table 4, along with LHV carbon intensities given in Table 3, and with an assumed airborne fraction of 50 percent, calculate the total increase in atmospheric CO2 that would
be caused by burning all of the
(a) Natural gas
(b) Petroleum
(c) Coal with 50 percent of the CO2 captured and stored
(d) Burning all three as stated previously, what would be the equilibrium global temperature increase with a climate sensitivity factor ¢T2X = 2.8°C and a current CO2 concentration of 380 ppm?
Suppose that in 100 years the world is virtually out of natural deposits of oil and gas and
energy demand is double the current rate of 330 EJ/yr. At that time, imagine that 28 percent of world energy comes from coal, 60 percent is synthetic gas and oil from coal with
a LHV carbon intensity of 44 gC/MJ, and the remainder is derived from noncarbonemitting sources. Using LHV values of carbon intensity,
(a) What would be the carbon emission rate then (Gt/yr)?
(b) If carbon emissions grow exponentially from the current rate of 6.0 GtC/yr to the rate
found in part a, what rate of growth r would have prevailed during that 100 years?
(c) If the airborne fraction is 50 percent, how much of the carbon emitted in the next
100 years would remain in the atmosphere?
(d) What would be the atmospheric concentration of CO2 in 100 years if there is no net
contribution from biomass (and there are 750 Gt of carbon in the atmosphere now)?
(e) If the equilibrium temperature increase for a doubling of CO2 is 3°C, what would be the
equilibrium temperature increase in 100 years if the initial concentration is 356 ppm?
Suppose in 100 years energy consumption is still 330 EJ/yr, but coal supplies only 20 percent of total demand, natural gas supplies 30 percent, and oil 10 percent. The remaining

40 percent of demand is met by noncarbon-emitting sources such as nuclear and solar
energy. Using this conservation scenario, repeat parts a through e of Problem 17.
One reason for sometimes using HHVs rather than LHVs is related to the strange efficiencies that may emerge when a conversion device actually takes advantage of the latent heat
normally lost in flue gases. Suppose a methane-fired condensing furnace has an HHV efficiency of 95 percent. What would its LHV efficiency be?
For each of the following fuels, find the carbon intensity based on the higher heating
values (HHV) given:
(a) Ethane, C2H6, HHV = 1,542 kJ/mol
(b) Propane, C3H8, HHV = 2,220 kJ/mol
(c) n-Butane, C4H10, HHV = 2,878 kJ/mol
Consider the following four ways to heat a house. The first uses a new high-efficiency
pulse-combustion gas furnace; the second uses a conventional gas furnace; the third uses
an electric heat pump that delivers 3 units of energy to the house for each unit of electrical energy that it consumes (the other 2 units are heat taken from the ambient air); and the
fourth uses conventional electric heating. Using HHV values of carbon intensity (since
these efficiencies are based on American definitions) and power plants fueled with coal,
compute the carbon emissions per unit of heat delivered to the house (gC/MJ).

Assuming it has been in that region since preindustrial times when the concentration was
275 ppb, find an appropriate k2 if the current concentration is 311 ppb and the forcing is
estimated to be 0.14 W/m2. Estimate the added radiative forcing in 2100 if it reaches a

Using the procedure described in Problem 32, compute the global warming potential for a

The IS92a emission scenario suggests anthropogenic emissions in 2025 equal to the
following: 44,700 * 109 kg CO2; 320 * 109 kg CH4; and 22 * 109 kg N2O. Weighting
these by their global warming potentials, what fraction of the total impact of that year’s
emissions of these three gases would be caused by each gas over the following time periods?
(a) 20 years
(b) 100 years
(c) 500 years
In 2006, the United States emitted 6,000 million metric tons (Mt) of CO2, 26.6 MtCH4,
and 1.2 MtN2O. Using 100-year global warming potentials, what is the equivalent CO2
emission rate of the total for these three gases, in GtC-eq/yr.
Direct greenhouse gas radiative forcing in the mid-1990s is estimated to be about
2.45 W/m2. If realized temperature is 75 percent of equilibrium temperature, what negative forcing by aerosols, and so on, would be needed to match the 0.6°C realized global
temperature increase actually observed? Assume that an appropriate climate sensitivity
factor l is 0.57.
Repeat Example 12, but this time use a 100-yr instead of the 20-yr GWP for methane
leakage.
Based on a 1990 world fossil-fuel carbon emission rate of 6.0 Gt/yr and total fossil fuel
carbon ever emitted equivalent to the consumption of 200,000 EJ of coal (LHV) for each
of the following values of maximum emission rate, plot a graph of carbon emissions vs.
time using a Gaussian emission function. In what year would maximum emissions occur?
(a) Maximum emission rate of 22 GtC/yr
(b) Maximum emission rate of 34 GtC/yr

Many economists favor a carbon tax as a way to discourage CO2 emissions. Suppose such
a tax were to be set at $20 per metric ton of carbon emissions as (CO2). Consider a small,
50-MW, 35 percent-efficient coal-fired power plant. Using a carbon intensity for coal of
24 gC/MJ,

of 100%?
(b) Suppose a tree plantation sequesters (removes from the atmosphere and stores in biomass) on the order of 5,000 kg of carbon per year per acre over the 40 years that the
trees are growing (after which time the forest is mature, and no further accumulation
of carbon occurs). What area of forest would have to be planted to “offset” the power
plant’s emissions over the next 40 years (roughly the lifetime of the power plant)?
(c) How much could the owners of the plant pay for the forestry project ($/acre per year)

(b) Suppose a soil-vapor extraction system is installed at the landfill to suck up the
methane before it leaks into the atmosphere. If that methane is burned, the methane
is converted to CO2. What would be the CO2 emissions per year now?
(c) What is the equivalent CO2 savings by burning the methane? How many tonnes per
year of C emissions (as CO2) would be saved?
(d) If a carbon tax of $20/tonne of C (as CO2) is enacted, how much tax could be saved
per year by burning the methane instead of letting it leak out of the landfill?
(e) A carbon tax of $20/tonne of C is the same as a tax of $5.45 per tonne of CO2 (carbon is 12/44ths of the mass of CO2). Using the tons of CO2 equivalents found in a,
how much tax could be saved per year if the methane is burned instead of letting it
leak out of the landfill?
Gasoline is approximately C7H15, and 1 gallon of it weighs about 6.15 pounds. Assume
that all of the carbon in gasoline is emitted as CO2 when it is burned.
(a) Suppose an old car that only gets 12 miles per gallon (mpg) will be driven 40,000 more
miles before it ends up in the junk yard. How much carbon will it emit during that time?
(b) If the car weighs 4,000 pounds, and it is driven 10,000 miles per year, what is the
ratio of the weight of carbon emitted per year to the weight of the car?
(c) Suppose there is a carbon tax of $15 per ton of carbon ($4.08 per ton of CO2). What
would the carbon tax be on 1 gallon of gasoline?
(d) How much would carbon emissions be reduced over those 40,000 miles if that old car
is replaced with a new one that gets 40 mpg?

cars off the road, how much should the utility be willing to pay to encourage the
owner of the old clunker to trade it in on a 40-mpg car?
Consider the potential carbon emissions from a gasoline-powered car compared with the
carbon emissions to make the electricity for an electric car.

emissions (gC/mi) assuming that gasoline contains 5.22 pounds of carbon per gallon?
(b) An efficient combined-cycle, natural-gas-fired power plant needs about 8,000 kJ of
heat to generate 1 kWh of electricity. At 13.8 gC/MJ for natural gas, what would be

Introduction
On March 22, 1987, the garbage barge Mobro 4000 and its tug, the Break of Dawn,
left the port of New York loaded with 3,200 tons of solid waste on its way to a port
in North Carolina where its cargo was meant to become fuel for an ill-conceived
waste-to-methane project. Along the way, questions emerged about medical wastes
possibly being part of its load, which led to the revocation of its permit to dock.
Thus began the Mobro’s famous six-month, 6,000 mile odyssey as it searched for a
friendly port willing to take its load of trash. It was refused entry in six states and
three foreign countries before returning to New York Harbor and, after a heated
legal battle, was finally allowed to dock and deliver its refuse to an incinerator in
Brooklyn. The press distorted the story, and the Mobro inadvertently became a powerful symbol of a not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY), “throw-away” society that had run
out of a convenient “away.”
Perhaps stimulated by the Mobro episode, much has changed in the field of
solid waste management in the past two decades. The per capita rate at which the
United States generates municipal solid waste (MSW) grew from 2.7 pounds per day
in the 1960s to 4.5 pounds by 1990, at which point it came to a virtual standstill,
with the 2005 rate still being 4.5 pounds per day per person. Meanwhile, the recycling rate has grown substantially, from 10 percent of generated MSW in 1980 to
32 percent in 2005, which means less has to go to landfills. In fact, in the United
States, we now have 80 percent fewer landfills than existed at the time of the Mobro
in 1987. Most of the sites that closed down were smaller, older sites, which were not
designed with today’s level of environmental controls. Those that remain are bigger
and better.
Historically (certainly well into the twentieth century), solid waste management was of the most rudimentary sort even in the most developed countries of the
world. Garbage, if it was collected at all, usually ended up at the local dump where
open burning was commonly used to control both the volume and public health
dangers associated with the waste. It wasn’t until roughly 1950 that most urban
areas in the United States ceased operating unsightly, rat-infested open dumps.
More recently, and for a number of reasons, the technologies used to manage our
wastes have become increasingly sophisticated. As the quote at the beginning of
this chapter illustrates, present policies emphasize waste reduction and recycling to
minimize the volume and toxicity of the materials that must be disposed of. The
“away” that the remaining wastes are heading toward may include incineration,
perhaps with energy recovery, and/or disposal in carefully engineered and managed
sanitary landfills.

RCRA Wastes
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which is the major federal
statute that governs solid waste, delineates two categories of waste: hazardous and
nonhazardous waste. Most of the focus in RCRA is on Subtitle C, which defines and
regulates hazardous waste. In this chapter, however, we want to address Subtitle D,

nonhazardous wastes (Figure 1). Of the roughly 12 billion tons per year of nonhazardous wastes, most is generated by industry during raw material extraction, material processing, and product manufacturing. Most of this chapter, however, will be
looking at the roughly 2 percent of total wastes that make up the category referred
to as municipal solid waste (MSW).
The magnitude of the earth- and ore-moving task needed to provide the minerals society demands is truly monumental. Digging holes, removing the ores, and piling up the leftover residues creates enormous aesthetic, environmental, economic,
and energy problems. Table 1 provides an estimate of typical amounts of materials
that must be moved and processed to produce some of our most important minerals.
Producing the metals and other basic materials used in our society requires considerable amounts of energy, which adds its own costs and environmental impacts. In
some cases, such as aluminum, the cost of that energy is a major fraction of the total
cost of production, which provides a major incentive to recycle it rather than producing it from virgin materials.
Even though MSW is dwarfed in size (and environmental impact) by the other
sectors, it should be remembered that all of that industrial waste is created in the
process of providing us with the material things that ultimately may end up in our
trash. Consuming less therefore saves not only the wastes that would have ended

603

up in the municipal wastestream, but it also reduces the energy, materials, and waste
associated with providing those items that we just might be able live without.
Clearly, attention needs to be directed not just at the management of consumer
wastes but at the complete set of processes that result in the products our society
seems to think it needs.

Municipal Solid Waste
Before we can more carefully consider the material flows and environmental impacts of wastes, some definitions need to be provided. Figure 2 may help keep some
of these terms straight.
Solid wastes are wastes that aren’t liquid or gaseous, such as durable goods,
nondurable goods, containers and packaging, food scraps, yard trimmings,
and miscellaneous inorganic wastes. Solid waste is more or less synonymous
with the term refuse, but solid waste is the preferred term.
Municipal solid waste (MSW) is solid waste from residential, commercial,
institutional, and industrial sources, but it does not include such things as construction waste, automobile bodies, municipal sludges, combustion ash, and
industrial process wastes even though those wastes might also be disposed of
in municipal waste landfills or incinerators.
Garbage, or food waste, is the animal and vegetable residue resulting from
the preparation, cooking, and serving of food. This waste is largely putrescible
organic matter and moisture. Home kitchens, restaurants, and markets are
sources of garbage, but the term usually does not include wastes from large foodprocessing facilities such as canneries, packing plants, and slaughterhouses.

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

Rubbish consists of old tin cans, newspaper, tires, packaging materials, bottles,
yard trimmings, plastics, and so forth. Both combustible and noncombustible
solid wastes are included, but rubbish does not include garbage.
Trash is the combustible portion of rubbish.
Generation refers to the amounts of materials and products that enter the
waste stream. Activities that reduce the amount or toxicity of wastes before
they enter the municipal waste system, such as reusing refillable glass bottles
or reusing plastic bags, are not included.
Materials recovery is the term used to cover the removal of materials from the
wastestream for purposes of recycling or composting.
Discards are the solid waste remaining after materials are removed for recycling or composting. These are the materials that are burned or buried. In
other words,
Waste generation = Materials recovered + Discards

MSW Generation in the United States
The EPA estimates that the United States generated 246 million tons of municipal
solid waste in 2005, which is about 4.5 pounds per person per day. As shown in
Figure 3, paper and paperboard products are the largest single component of MSW
(34.2 percent by weight; another 37 percent is roughly equally divided among yard
trimmings, food scraps and plastics). Figure 4 shows the historical growth in generation of MSW, by source. Over the years, the single largest component—paper and
paperboard products—grew steadily until 2000, but it seems, finally, to be leveling
off. In recent years, the second largest component, yard trimmings, has been declining in importance as backyard composting and mulching lawnmowers have become
more common. One category that continues to grow steadily is plastics.

Solid Waste Management
Management of municipal solid wastes includes recovery of materials for recycling
and composting, combustion with or without energy recovery, and finally disposal
in landfills or other locations (Figure 5).

Integrated Solid Waste Management
An approach called integrated solid waste management is intended to help guide
decisions about the generation of wastes, recycling of materials, and ultimate disposal of waste residues. An outline of some of the highlights of integrated solid waste
management is suggested in Table 2. Source reduction and recycling in almost all circumstances are given the highest priority, and it is easy to understand why:
• To reduce the amount of solid waste that has to be burned or buried
• To reduce pollution associated with mining, use, and disposal of resources
• To reduce the rate of consumption of scarce resources.
While the order in which the entries in Table 2 have been listed is purposely intended to suggest a hierarchy of priorities, that hierarchy is not rigid. For example,
is lightweight packaging that uses less material always better than more substantial
packaging? If the heavier packaging can more easily be recycled, it might be better
than the lightweight materials that go straight to the dump. Perhaps the heavyweight materials would burn cleanly in a waste-to-energy incinerator, while toxics in
the lightweight packaging might make it inappropriate for combustion.

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

The disposal priorities suggested in Table 2, which would appear to rank
combustion with energy recovery above landfilling, are controversial. Not only
would combustion characteristics of the waste affect the decision, but also the relative suitability of local topography and meteorology for landfills versus incinerators
needs to be evaluated. The history of MSW combustion has, in fact, been a checkered one. In 1960, about 30 percent of MSW was burned in incinerators, typically
with no air pollution controls and no energy recovery. As concern for air quality
grew in the 1960s and 1970s, those old incinerators were closed, and the fraction of
our wastes that was burned dropped to a low of 10 percent in the early 1980s. As
incinerators with emission controls and energy recovery began to come on line, the
quantity of MSW burned rose quickly in the 1980s, rising to about 16 percent in the
1990s, but their performance has been somewhat problematic, and there has been
little growth since then.

The Status of Integrated Waste Management
in the United States
The impact of the integrated waste management perspective can be demonstrated
with some statistics. Of the 246 million tons of MSW generated in the United States
in 2005, just under one-third was recovered for recycling or composting, up from
7 percent in 1960 and 17 percent in 1990. Of the wastestream that was not recycled
or composted, 80 percent went to landfills, and the remainder was combusted with
energy recovery. As can be seen in Figure 6, the rate at which MSW is disposed of

in landfills has remained relatively steady and has even declined some over the past
25 years, in spite of a nearly 50 percent increase in population.
The per capita generation of municipal solid waste in the United States is
typically at least twice as high as it is for most European countries, as shown in
Table 3. For comparison, the percentages of waste generated that is landfilled and
the population densities are also shown in the table. While there is some correlation
between population density and landfilling, there are notable exceptions. Sparsely
populated countries, such as Australia and Canada, tend to landfill very high fractions of their wastes, as might be expected, while densely populated countries such
as Japan and Italy landfill less and incinerate more. Japan, for example, is 12 times
as densely populated as the United States, and it landfills only 33 percent of its
municipal solid waste, while incinerating 64 percent. The United Kingdom, on the
other hand, is also much more densely populated than the United States, but it sends
a higher fraction of its waste to landfills than we do.

Source Reduction
“Garbage that is not produced does not have to be collected,” is a simple enough
concept, yet, in the United States, it has taken a long time to receive the attention
that it deserves. In this regard, we have been lagging behind many other advanced
countries in the world—especially those with modest domestic resources and limited
land space for disposal, such as Germany and Japan.

Green Product Design Strategies
Design that concerns itself with reducing the environmental impacts associated with

609

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

prevention strategy. Fortunately, companies that design green products and businesses that use them are finding bottom-line, market benefits that go beyond simply
feeling good about their endeavors.
A number of strategies have been identified that contribute to good green
design practices, including the following (Keoleian et al., 1994).
Material Selection. A critical stage in product development is selection of
appropriate materials to be used. In green design, attempts are made to evaluate the
environmental impacts associated with the acquisition, processing, use, and retirement of the materials under consideration. In some cases, substituting one material
for another can have a modest impact on the quality and price of the resulting product but can have considerable impact on the environmental consequences.
Designers today have a much greater range of materials to choose from in
developing their products. Ceramics and composites offer superior strength with
lighter weight than the traditional materials such as steel and aluminum. Highstrength alloys and plastics are quickly displacing the metals used in the past. For
example, the telecommunications cables that AT&T used in the 1950s consisted
mostly of steel, lead, and copper, with small percentages of aluminum and about
1 percent plastics. By the mid-1980s, polyethylene had replaced virtually all of the
lead that had been used in the cables’ sheathing so that the fraction of plastics is now
more than 35 percent. Such progress continues with fiber-optic cables, which are
now replacing traditional copper cables, weighing only 3 percent as much as copper
and using only 5 percent of the energy to produce (OTA, 1992).
An especially important aspect of materials selection is the need to reduce the
toxicity of materials whenever possible. Toxic substances used in products can
create serious environmental risks when those products are in use as well as when
they end up in our wastestream. Toxic substances emitted from everyday products
we use in our homes; volatile organic compounds released from building materials
and glues; and insecticides, paints, and solvents that we store in our garage have the
potential to cause us direct harm when we come in contact with them, and that
harm can continue when they end up in landfills or incinerators. Along with these
products, heavy metals, such as lead, cadmium, chromium, mercury, arsenic, copper,
tin, and zinc, are quite commonly used in consumer products and an especially dangerous component in MSW. Examples of sources of heavy metals in the municipal
wastestream are shown in Table 4.

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

Product System Life Extension. Products that don’t wear out as quickly don’t
have to be replaced as often, which usually means resources are saved, and less
waste is generated. Sometimes products are discarded for reasons that have nothing
to do with their potential lifetime, such as computers that become obsolete and
clothing fashions that change, but many products can continue to remain in service
for extended periods of time if they are designed to be durable, reliable, reusable,
remanufacturable, and repairable.
Extending product life, of course, mean consumers replace their products less
often, which translates into decreased sales volume for manufacturers. The temptation
toward planned obsolescence can hopefully be replaced by the realization that
market share in the future may be driven by consumer demand for greener products.
Material Life Extension. Once a product has reached the end of its useful life,
the materials from which it was made may still have economic value and additional
savings can result from avoiding disposal. The key design parameter for extending
the life of materials is the ease with which products can be recycled when they reach
the end of their useful life. Manufacturers are beginning to face legislative mandates
and other pressures to either physically take back their products when consumers
are finished with them, or assure in some way that significant fractions of their
products will be recycled.
Europe has led the way in this regard, and since that is such a major market,
many major manufacturers are including design for disassembly and recyclability
no matter where their products are likely to be sold. Recycling mandates for certain
products have been enacted, including the End of Life Vehicle (ELV) Directive,
which currently requires 80 percent of an ELV to be reused and recycled, and by
2015, that rate escalates to 90 percent. ELVs can only be scrapped at authorized
treatment facilities, which are required to meet tight environmental standards. The
cost of these facilities is paid for in large part by the vehicle manufacturers.
A similar measure called the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment
(WEEE) Directive focuses on keeping hazardous materials out of landfills. The
United States is beginning to follow Europe’s lead, and in 2006, a number of computer manufacturers and some “big-box” retailers began takeback programs for
computers and other electronic products. Some of these charge a nominal fee, some
are free, and some offer consumers a cash rebate for returned equipment.
Reduced Material Intensiveness. Green design strategies include reducing the
amount, and/or toxicity, of material required to make a given product, while maintaining the usefulness and value of the product. Changes in battery technology provide a good example. In 1974, a typical car battery contained about 30 pounds of
lead, but modern batteries use less than 20 pounds. Common household batteries
now use much less mercury than they did in the past, and many new battery technologies incorporate materials that are far less toxic.
The history of beverage containers provides another example of sizable reductions in materials intensiveness. Nonrefillable (one-way) 0.47 L (16 oz) glass bottles,
for example, are 37 percent lighter than they were in the 1970s. Similar lightweighting for steel cans, aluminum cans, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) one-piece
plastic bottles is shown in Table 5.

Process Management. Manufacturing products requires raw materials and
energy inputs, both of which often can be managed more efficiently.
The energy required to manufacture a product is an important component of a
lifecycle assessment. Process improvements such as waste-heat recovery, use of more
efficient motors and motor controls, and high-efficiency lighting are almost always
cost-effective. Since electric motors account for two-thirds of the electricity used
by industry (and almost half of the electricity used in the United States for all purposes), a good place to look for efficiency improvements is there. It is not uncommon for motors to be oversized and to run at constant speed, with both factors
contributing to low energy efficiency. When motors are used to pump fluids, the
pumping rate is usually controlled by adjusting valves or dampers rather than by
adjusting the speed of the motor itself, which wastes electricity. New electronic
adjustable-speed drives, coupled with more efficient motors, can often save half of
the energy normally used.
Better materials management can also lead to lower environmental impacts.
Wastes can be minimized by more carefully estimating and ordering needed inputs,
especially when they are hazardous materials, and by more careful inventory control.
Efficient Distribution. Methods of packaging and transporting products
greatly affect the overall energy and environmental impacts associated with those
products.
Transportation costs are affected by the quantity and type of material shipped,
which is in turn affected by packaging, trip distance, and type of carrier. The type of
carrier is constrained by the terrain to be covered as well as the speed required for
timely arrival. In general, shipping by boat is the least energy-intensive option,
followed by rail, truck, and then air, which is fastest but requires the most energy per
ton-mile transported. If pipelines are an option (as for example, transport of petroleum), they can be even less energy intensive per ton-mile than transport by ship.
Packaging can be considered a component of distribution. Reducing the
amount of packaging can reduce the environmental costs of distribution, but may
increase deterioration of the product as it is damaged or loses freshness. Using recycled materials for packaging along with strategies that reduce the amount of packaging can contribute to reduced environmental lifecycle costs. Once again, Europe
leads the way in helping to reduce packaging waste. Germany, for example, long ago
shifted the burden of packaging disposal from the consumer back onto manufacturers and distributors. Their Packaging Waste Law requires manufacturers and distributors to recover and recycle their own packaging wastes.

612

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

Eco-Labels
Surveys have consistently shown that consumers, if given a choice, are willing to
purchase products that are environmentally superior to competing products, even
if they cost a bit more. Clearly, from the pair of lifecycle assessments just described,
a detailed LCA list of emissions, energy inputs, and disposal impacts would overwhelm even the most conscientious consumer. At the opposite extreme are a variety
of relatively ambiguous terms such as “recyclable,” “recycled,” “eco-safe,” “ozonefriendly,” and “biodegradable” that often appear on product labels. Without a
uniform and consistent standard for such terms, these labels are all too often meaningless or even misleading. For example, all soaps and detergents have been
“biodegradable” since the 1960s, and “CFC-free, ozone-friendly” aerosols have
been the norm in the United States since the banning of CFCs for such applications
in 1978. Labels claiming a product is “eco-safe” or “environmentally safe” usually
have little meaning since the terms are largely undefined.
Clearly, a credible labeling system certifying that the products and packaging
bearing such labels have been independently certified to meet certain environmental
standards can be a powerful motivator in the marketplace. It is interesting to note
that the EPA once proposed the establishment of a national eco-label but has since
abandoned the idea, leaving such labels in the hands of the private sector. To that
end, there are now several competing eco-labels being promulgated by private
organizations in the United States. Green Seal labels provide a simple, overall stamp
of approval for consumer products, analogous to the Underwriter Laboratories (UL)
label on electrical appliances or the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. Scientific
Certification Systems, on the other hand, develops standards and certification programs for manufacturers, including its SCS Sustainable Choice certification for
building products. The SCS certification is based on a multifaceted rating system
that includes such components as public health and environment, renewable energy
and efficiency, recycled materials, corporate environmental and social responsibility,
and end-of-life management for sustainable reuse of materials.
In contrast to the United States, in other parts of the world, national labels
are prevalent. Examples of such labels shown in Figure 7 include the “Blue Angel”
in Germany, the Japanese and Indian versions of an “EcoMark,” and the “Environmental Choice” label used in Canada.

Lifecycle Assessment
Solid waste management all too often focuses almost entirely on what to do with a
given wastestream, with the key decision being whether to incinerate the waste or
bury it. As landfills filled up and closed, as incinerators were shut down due to poor
performance, and as communities became more agitated by the environmental
impacts of living near either type of facility, a new, broader, approach to the problem has emerged. Using an energy and materials balance approach at every stage in
the lifecycle of a product can yield new insights into not only the solid waste problem but also problems of air and water pollution.
A conceptual diagram for the lifecycle assessment (LCA) of a product is presented in Figure 8. Inputs include energy and raw materials utilized in each stage

of production, use, and disposal of the product. The central box in the figure suggests the various stages in the product lifecycle, which includes the acquisition and
processing of materials (mining, smelting, and so on), the actual manufacturing of
the product itself, the packaging and distribution of the product, the use of the product, and, finally, the ultimate disposal of the product. Outputs are the air, water, and
solid waste effluents associated with each stage, along with the waste heat dissipated in the environment plus energy that may be recovered during disposal.

FIGURE 8 The lifecycle of a product, including clarification of the terms reuse,

Figure 8 also helps define some of the terms that are used to describe the
potential recovery of materials in the product lifecycle.
Reusing a product in the same application for which it was originally intended
saves energy and resources. For example, a plastic bag can carry groceries
home from the market over and over again and a polystyrene cup might be
used several times before disposal. Returnable glass bottles for soft drinks are
another example. A product can also be reused for some other purpose, such
as occurs when glass jars are reused in a workshop to hold small objects such
as screws or nails.
Remanufacturing refers to the process of restoring a product to like-new
condition. The restoration begins by completely disassembling the product,
cleaning and refurbishing the reusable parts, and then stocking those parts in
inventory. That inventory, along with new parts, is used to remanufacture
products that are equal in quality to new units. Some distinguish between
remanufacturing and repair. Repair means only those parts that have failed are
replaced. For example, malfunctioning components on a faulty electronic
circuit board might be replaced rather than throwing out the entire product.
Recycling is the term used to describe the act of recovering materials from the
wastestream and reprocessing them so they become raw materials for new
applications.

An Example Lifecycle Assessment: Polystyrene Cups
As an example of the value (and difficulty) of performing a complete lifecycle assessment, consider a comparison of the environmental impacts of single-use, 8-ounce,
hot-drink containers made from polystyrene foam with similar cups made from
uncoated paper (Hocking, 1991). As shown in Table 6, the raw materials inputs for
the two types of cups are very different. A paper cup requires about 21 g of wood
and bark plus 1.2 g of chemicals to produce an 8.2-g cup, while a 1.9-g polystyrene

cup requires 2.4 g of petroleum feedstock plus 0.08 g of other chemicals. From the
materials-input perspective, it is very difficult to compare the environmental impacts
associated with logging with the impacts associated with drilling, transporting, and
processing petroleum.
In terms of energy requirements, processing of raw wood, to pulp, to fully
bleached kraft paper for the paper cup uses large amounts of process heat (steam)
and electricity. If we assume that the steam and electricity are produced by burning
residual fuel oil, a total of about 3.8 g of fuel per cup are required. Converting
petroleum feedstock into polystyrene also uses significant quantities of heat and
electricity. Crude oil or natural gas are first cracked in the presence of steam to yield
ethylene or benzene, which are in turn catalyzed to produce ethylbenzene. Ethylbenzene is then thermally decomposed to styrene, which is converted to polystyrene.
Hocking’s analysis indicates that roughly the same amount of process heat per cup
is required to make polystyrene or bleached kraft paper, but about 13 times as
much electricity is required for the paper cup. Assuming that fuel oil is burned in a
33 percent-efficient power plant to produce the electricity needed, the paper cup
uses roughly 80 percent more energy than the Styrofoam cup (3.8 g of oil equivalents per cup vs. 2.1 g). However, if we add in the petrochemical feedstock needed
for the polystyrene cup, the paper cup uses roughly 15 percent less petroleum (3.8 g
of oil vs. 4.5 g).
Most of the air and water effluents are considerably higher for the paper
cup, although the comparison is complicated by the fact that the manufacturing
processes for paper and polystyrene are so different. Production of polystyrene, for
example, emits significant amounts of pentane (the foam blowing agent that has
replaced chlorofluorocarbons), while paper production does not emit any. While
pentane is not an ozone-depleting substance, it can contribute to photochemical
smog. Again, it would be difficult to decide whether, for example, pentane emissions
from the manufacture of polystyrene are more important than the higher criteria air
pollutants emitted during paper production.
Consider the use, reuse, and recyclability of the two cups. The polystyrene
cups are stiffer and stronger, especially when holding hot liquids, and their natural
insulation helps keep the drinks hotter and the outside surface cooler. It is easy to
imagine reusing the same polyfoam cup several times while at a party or conference,
but the poor structural integrity of a paper cup—expecially when hot—makes it less
likely to be reused. Both types of cups can be recycled, but the hot melt adhesive
used in paper cups makes them somewhat less attractive.
At the disposal end of the lifecycle, if the cups are incinerated properly, they
both burn cleanly and they both produce about the same amount of ash. If the
incineration includes energy recovery, the paper cups yield roughly twice as much
heat recovery per cup. However, since paper cups have four times the mass, paper
cups yield about half as much energy per kilogram. If they are buried in a landfill
rather than being burned in an incinerator, the polystyrene cup is compressed
to roughly the same volume as the paper cup. The paper cups, however, are
biodegradable (but very slowly), which means they can eventually take up less
space, but their degradation produces a potent greenhouse gas, methane, and the
liquids that filter through the landfill will contribute to the BOD of the leachate.
If the landfill is well managed, the methane and leachate are easily controlled, but if

617

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

it is poorly managed, it might be better to have the nonbiodegradable polystyrene
to deal with.
As should be obvious by now, the paper versus polystyrene cup analysis illustrates how difficult it is to reach solid conclusions when performing a lifecycle
assessment. Besides the many assumptions that must be made to generate any of the
numerical comparisons, what conclusions can be drawn when the two approaches
produce sorts of environmental impacts? Perhaps Hocking’s conclusion that “it
would appear that polystyrene foam cups should be given a much more evenhanded assessment as regards their environmental impact than they have received
during the past few years” (Hocking, 1991, p. 745) is about as strong a statement as
can be made in this controversial debate.

Soft-Drink Containers
As another example of lifecycle analysis, consider the comparison of environmental
impacts associated with a number of common soft-drink containers. The energy
requirements, air and water emissions, and volume of solid waste for each container system are presented in Table 7. For almost every measure, refillable glass bottles cause the least environmental impact. Unfortunately, although they were
common in the past, supermarkets and convenience stores have been switching to
throwaways to avoid having to accept and store returnables (although they are still
popular in Europe). By comparison, nonrefillable glass bottles use several times as
much energy, and their emissions and solid waste requirements are correspondingly
higher as well.
In the United States, plastic bottles and aluminum cans have become the containers of choice. Although not as benign as returnable bottles, from an energy
standpoint both would seem to be better than one-way glass bottles. Unfortunately,
making comparisons for air and water emissions for glass, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and aluminum containers is more difficult than the table would suggest
since the types of pollution for each will be considerably different.

Waste Management, Energy, and Greenhouse Gases
A lifecycle analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must cover a long series of
steps from extraction and processing of raw materials to manufacture of products,
transportation of products to markets, consumer choices, waste collection, recycling
or composting, and finally how we manage the discards that end up in landfills
or incinerators. At every step, from extraction of ores to waste disposal, there are
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that can be affected by solid waste management
decisions. Most processes lead to GHG emissions, but some can help reduce them
by increasing carbon stored in landfills or from increased biomass growth from
composted organic materials. Figure 9 summarizes these possibilities, while the following list helps describe the factors:
• Fossil fuel combustion emissions when making, transporting, using, and disposing products that enter the wastestream.
• Nonenergy-related manufacturing emissions, such as the CO2 released when
limestone is converted to lime for concrete and steel manufacturing.
• Methane (CH4) emissions from landfills.
• Methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from waste
combustion.
• Carbon sequestration in materials that are stored for a long period of time in
landfills.

Solid Waste Management and Greenhouse Gases
Translating emissions as well as carbon sinks into equivalent greenhouse gases
requires a careful analysis of the energy inputs (for example, coal, oil, natural gas,
electricity) as well as the types of greenhouse gases that are emitted (for example,
CO2, CH4, N2O). Recall that non-CO2 greenhouse gases are weighted according to
their Global Warming Potentials (GWPs). The 100-year GWP of methane, for example, is 23, which means 1 ton of methane is equivalent to 23 tons of carbon dioxide. The usual unit for a mixture of greenhouse gases is metric tons of carbon
equivalents (MTCE). Notice MTCE is expressed as carbon and not carbon dioxide.
Since the molecular weight of CO2 is 44, and the atomic weight of carbon is 12, 1
metric ton of CO2 is actually 12>44 = 0.273 MTCE.
Table 8 shows some examples of potential greenhouse gas emission reductions associated with source reduction, recycling versus landfilling, and combustion
versus landfilling. Source reduction values depend on whether the reduction offsets
virgin materials or the current mix of virgin and recycled inputs to the manufacturing process. Negative values mean greenhouse emissions are greater than what
would occur if the material were landfilled.
EXAMPLE 1 Recycling at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)
A recent study of recycling at the Los Angeles International Airport found that
LAX generates about 19,000 tons of solid waste per year (1.3 pounds per passenger). On an annual basis, LAX recycles 12 tons of aluminum, 2,021 tons of

cardboard, 527 tons of office paper, 89 tons of newspaper, 17 tons of glass, and
921 tons of plastic. In addition, they compost 271 tons of food waste (Atkins,
2006).
a. Find the equivalent greenhouse gas savings associated with these recycled
and composted materials assuming they would have all gone to a landfill if
they hadn’t been recycled.
b. If the landfill charges $80/ton (called the tipping fee), how much money is
saved in tipping fees by recycling and composting?
c. If, in the future, there is a carbon tax of $10 per metric ton of carbon
dioxide, how much would LAX save in carbon taxes at the current recycling rate?
Solution
a. Using values from Table 8, the greenhouse gas savings are
12 tons aluminum * 3.71 MTCE/ton = 44.5 MTCE
2,021 tons cardboard * 0.96 = 1,940.2 MTCE

621

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

527 tons office paper * 1.31 = 690.3 MTCE
89 tons of newspaper * 0.52 = 46.3 MTCE
17 tons of glass * 0.50 = 8.5 MTCE
921 tons of plastic * 0.42 = 386.8 MTCE
217 tons of food waste * 0.25 = 54.3 MTCE
Total = 3,170 metric tons of equivalents
b. The total reduction in waste to be landfilled is
Saved tons = 12 + 2,021 + 527 + 89 + 17 + 921 + 217 = 3,804 tons
Saved landfill fees = 3,804 tons/yr * $80/ton = $304,320/yr
c. Total equivalent carbon reductions as CO2 = 44>12 * 3,170 = 11,623
metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. At $10 per metric ton of CO2, the
carbon tax savings would be
Tax savings = 11,623 metric tons CO2 * $10/ton = $110,623/yr
Only about 20 percent of LAX generated waste is recycled or composted. For
most airport waste, about two-thirds could be recycled or composted so the
above savings of $304,320 + $110,623 = $414,943 per year could potentially
triple with a more intensive recycling program.

Energy Implications of Solid Waste Management
Clearly, source reduction and recycling translate to less garbage going to incinerators and landfills, which means fewer air emissions and less water contamination.
A complete lifecycle analysis, however, yields a complex array of environmental
advantages, including energy savings, reduced water use, changes in the amounts
and constituents of air emissions and water pollution, solid waste disposal reductions, habitat conservation achieved by avoiding raw materials extraction, and so
forth. In this section, we want to focus on just the energy savings associated with
solid waste management options.
Table 9 shows the net energy savings by source reduction, recycling, composting or incinerating various materials in municipal solid waste instead of sending
them to a landfill. The source reduction values show energy savings for products that
would have been manufactured from virgin materials instead of the current mix of
recycled and virgin inputs. From the table, for example, by reading the news on the
Web and avoiding 1 ton of newspaper, 36.87 million Btus (MMBtu) of energy would
be saved if that source reduction is based on the current mix of virgin and recycled
materials, and 41.1 MMBtus if only virgin materials are avoided. If old newspapers
are recycled rather than being sent to a landfill, the savings is 16.91 MMBtu per ton
of newspapers collected. That savings includes all of the energy required to collect,
sort, and reprocess the materials versus deriving them from virgin sources. If old
newspapers are combusted (with the average fraction of MSW energy recovery), the
savings is 2.44 MMBtu/ton.
A graphical presentation of energy savings when products are recycled is
shown in Figure 10. Aluminum recycling saves the most energy per ton, which is a
reflection of the fact that manufacturing aluminum from virgin inputs is very energy

intensive, whereas relatively little energy is required to manufacture cans from recycled aluminum. Recycling carpet also results in significant energy savings since the
recycled material is turned into secondary products whose manufacture would have
required energy-intensive processes.
EXAMPLE 2 Energy Savings with LAX Recycling
Calculate the energy savings associated with the recycling operations at Los
Angeles International Airport using recycling data provided in Example 1.
Compare that energy savings with the cost of natural gas at $10 per million Btu.
Solution

Combining the recycling rates with the energy data in Table 9 gives

12 tons aluminum * 206.95 MMBtu/ton = 2,483 MMBtu
2,021 tons/yr carboard * 15.65 = 31,628 million Btu/yr
527 tons office paper * 10.09 = 5,317
89 tons of newspaper * 16.91 = 1,504
17 tons of glass * 2.65 = 45
921 tons of plastic * 52.94 = 48,757
217 tons of food waste * (-0.25) = -54
Total = 89,680 million Btu/yr
If that energy costs $10 per million Btu, this simple recycling program at one
airport saves society almost $900,000 per year.

Recycling
After source reduction, which is given the highest priority in the solid waste management hierarchy, the recovery of materials for recycling and composting is generally thought to be the next most important component of integrated solid waste
management programs. Resource recovery means that the materials have not only
been removed from the municipal wastestream, but they also must be, in essence,
purchased by an end user. That distinction, for example, means yard trimmings
composted at home are considered to be source reduction, not recycling. On the
other hand, yard trimmings that are delivered to an offsite composting facility and
then sold are considered to be recovered or recycled materials.
The term recycling is often misconstrued to include activities such as refilling
bottles for reuse and remanufacturing products for resale to consumers, but it is better to use the term only when materials are collected and used as raw materials for
new products. The process of recycling includes collecting recyclables, separating
them by type, processing them into new forms that are sold to manufacturers, and,
finally, purchasing and using goods made with reprocessed materials.
Another distinction that can be made is between preconsumer and postconsumer recyclable materials. Preconsumer materials consist of scrap that is recycled
by manufacturers back into the original manufacturing process without ever having

624

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

been turned into a useful product. Postconsumer recyclables are products that have
already been used by consumers for their originally intended purposes, such as
newspaper or plastic bottles, that are now part of the wastestream. Preconsumer
recycled materials are not included in EPA data on generation, recovery, and discards, and they generally are not counted in procurement laws that mandate government purchases of products with significant recycled-materials content.
Fine distinctions between terms such as resource recovery, reuse, remanufacturing, recyclable, preconsumer and postconsumer recycled materials, and so forth
may seem annoying or even unnecessary, but they are important when systematic
collection, reporting, and unambiguous interpretation of recycling data are needed.
The rate of recovery of materials from the wastestream, both for recycling
and composting, as reported by the EPA, has increased dramatically in the past few
decades. Resource recovery grew from less than 10 percent of all municipal solid
waste in 1980 to 16 percent in 1990 to 32 percent in 2005. Most of that increase is
attributable to greater rates of recovery of paper and paperboard and increased
composting of yard trimmings. Table 10 shows U.S. recovery rates for a number
of categories of MSW. Notice how dominant the paper and paperboard category is
in terms of total tons of material recovered (53 percent of total recovery), which
tends to mask the importance of recovery rates for other materials. For example,
recovered aluminum is less than 1 percent of the total mass of recovered materials,
but in terms of its total economic value, it far exceeds the paper products category.

EXAMPLE 3 Carbon and Energy Savings in Recycled Aluminum
Find the carbon and energy savings associated with the 0.69 million tons of
aluminum recycled each year. For perspective, compare the energy savings with
the energy needs for a typical 25 mpg car driven 12,000 miles per year burning
0.125 million Btu per gallon gasoline. Also compare the carbon emissions if the
car emits 4.2 metric tons of CO2 per year.
Solution From Table 8 we find that recycled aluminum saves 3.71 metric tons
of carbon equivalents per ton:
Carbon savings = 0.69 * 106 tons/yr * 3.71 MTCE/ton
= 2.56 * 106 MTCE/yr
CO2 savings = 2.56 * 106 MTCE/yr *
= 9.38 * 106 mt CO2/yr

44 tons CO2
12 tons C

At 4.2 metric tons of CO2 per year per car, this is equivalent to the emissions from
Car equivalents (carbon) =

9.38 * 106 mt CO2/yr
= 2.2 million cars
4.2 mt CO2/car

For energy savings, Table 9 indicates aluminum recycling saves 206.95 million
Btu/ton.
Energy savings = 0.69 * 106 tons/yr * 206.95 * 106 Btu/ton
= 143 * 1012 Btu/yr
One car =

12,000 miles/yr
* 0.125 * 106 Btu/gallon = 60 million Btu/yr
25 miles/gallon

Car equivalents (energy) =

143 * 1012 Btu/yr
60 * 106 Btu/yr/car

= 2.4 million cars

So, the simple recycling of only 21.5 percent of our aluminum is equivalent to taking over 2 million cars off the road in terms of both carbon and energy savings.

Paper and Paperboard Recycling
The largest single category of waste generation and waste recovery is paper and
paperboard products. In 2005, 84 million tons of paper products were generated
and 50 percent of that was recovered. Two types of paper products, corrugated
cardboard boxes and newspapers, together account for half of the paper products
generated and three-fourths of paper products recovered.
The Chinese invented paper 2,000 years ago when they discovered that vegetable fibers, such as bamboo or mulberry, when soaked in water formed mats of
fibrous material that bonded itself together and when dried could be used as a writing medium. Soon after, their process shifted to use of wood as the principal fiber

626

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

source. The U.S. papermaking industry began in 1860 using recycled fiber from
cotton, linen rags, and waste paper, but now virgin paper production is based
almost entirely on pulps made from wood chips. Other sources of fiber can include
straw, jute, flax, bagasse from sugar cane, and hemp—in fact, there is quite a surge
of interest these days in legalizing hemp as a source of fiber to reduce the need for
forest products.
Papermaking begins with pulping. For quality paper, the cellulose fibers in
wood chips must be separated from the lignins that hold the fibers together. The
process involves cooking, to soften the wood and chemical or mechanical treatment
to help separate the fibers. Most wood pulp is prepared using a chemical process.
For low-quality paper, such as newsprint, whole chips of wood can be pulped
mechanically, without removing the lignins, creating a product called groundwood.
Pulp is naturally tan in color, so chemical bleaching may be required if the end
product needs to be white. If the finished pulp needs to be transported some distance
to the papermill, it will be dried and baled; otherwise, it is pumped as a thick slurry
to the mill.
Recycled wastepaper has long been used as a source of fiber to augment pulp
made from virgin materials. Depending on the application, various fractions of
recycled and virgin materials can be incorporated—all the way up to 100 percent
recycled. Each recycling of wastepaper, however, results in losses so it is not possible
to use the same fiber over and over again. Each time paper is soaked in water,
heated, and processed, some of the cellulose breaks down into starches and is lost;
also, in each processing, some of the smaller fibers don’t bond together, and they are
lost as well. Not only is less fiber made available after each recycling, but the fibers
are shorter and the resulting product is not as strong as product made from virgin
materials. Nonetheless, there are abundant uses for recycled wastepaper.
Roughly half of U.S. recycled paper products are used to make paperboard
(cereal boxes, tablet backs, shoe boxes, and so on) and containerboard (corrugated
cardboard). For such applications, product whiteness is not important. When paper
products are to be recycled into newsprint or other papers, an additional de-inking
stage must be added to the processing, which increases costs. Recycled wastepaper is
also used to make various construction products such as cellulose insulation, fiberboard, and some flooring materials. Other applications include animal bedding,
nursery pots, garden mulch, and trays.
The standard recycling symbol, used worldwide, is the familiar triangle of
arrows that form a Möbius strip (Figure 11). For paper products, when the arrows

stand alone, whether colored or not, it means the product is recyclable. When the
arrows are contained within a circle, it means the product is made from recycled
materials.
The economic value of recycled paper very much depends on the characteristics of the paper collected. In fact, the Paper Stock Institute has defined 51 grades of
recycled paper and paper products, and each category has its own pricing structure
when sold. Prices for recycled paper products have traditionally been volatile,
depending on ever-changing market conditions. For example, the price of old corrugated containers (OCC) jumped from $30/ton in 1993, to $200/ton in 1996, but fell
back again to $80/ton in 1998. In 2005, OCC was selling for about $90/ton.

Recycling Plastics
The rate at which plastics enter the municipal solid wastestream in the United States
has grown phenomenally from 0.4 million tons per year in 1960 to 18 million tons
in 1993, and 29 million tons in 2005. Plastics now comprise almost 12 percent of
the weight of all municipal solid waste generated, but since they are so bulky, they
account for one-fourth of the total volume in landfills. Although all plastics are
theoretically recyclable, less than 6 percent are actually recovered.
The term plastics encompasses a wide variety of resins or polymers with different characteristics and uses. Plastics are produced by converting basic hydrocarbon
building blocks such as methane and ethane into long chains of repeating molecules
called polymers. While there are natural polymers such as cellulose, starch, and
natural rubbers, it is only the synthetic materials that are referred to as plastics. One
way to categorize plastics is based on their behavior when heated. Roughly 80 percent are thermoplastics, which can be remelted and remolded into new products.
The other 20 percent are thermoset plastics, which decompose when they are heated, so they are more difficult to recycle.
The Plastic Bottle Institute of the Society of the Plastics Industry has developed
a voluntary coding system for plastic bottles and other rigid containers, which uses
the familiar three arrows in a triangle, this time with a numerical designation that
indicates the type of resin used in the plastic. Table 11 describes the labeling system
and highlights the main uses of the designated plastics.
Although the three-arrow symbol is usually thought to mean the product is
recyclable, in the case of plastics it is really only polyethylene terepthalate (PET or
PETE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) that are recycled to any significant
degree. In fact, while soft-drink bottles (PET) and milk and water bottles (HDPE)
make up less than 6 percent of the total plastic products generated in MSW, they
account for almost two-thirds of all recycled plastic. PET provides a better barrier to
transmission of gases than HDPE, which makes it a better container for carbonated
beverages and other foods whose aromas need to be contained. PET also fetches a
much higher price in the recycling market.
When plastics are recycled, it is often important to carefully separate them by
resin type and color. Different resins have different melting points, so if a batch of
mixed plastics is being heated and reformed into new products, some resins may not
melt at all, and some may end up burning. A single PVC bottle in a batch of 20,000
PET bottles, for example, can ruin the whole batch and potentially damage the manufacturing equipment (Moore, 1994). Similarly, if polypropylene, which is difficult

to distinguish from polyethylene, contaminates a batch of recycled polyethylene, the
resulting blend would be useless. Plastic recycling is also complicated by the potential for contamination by the products that they once contained. Plastics do absorb,
to varying degrees, materials that they come in contact with. Substances such as
pesticides and various oils will migrate slowly into their plastic containers, and some
will survive the melting and reforming processes when recycled. For that reason, the
Food and Drug Administration keeps a careful eye on the use of recycled plastics for
direct-food-contact applications.
Recycled plastics find application in a number of products. Recycled PET bottles, for example, are being transformed into quality fibers for jackets and other outdoor clothing, as well as fiberfill material for cushions. They are also used to make
carpeting, surfboards, sailboat hulls, as well as new PET soft drink bottles. To avoid
the contamination problem mentioned previously, recovered PET used in new soft
drink bottles is usually sandwiched between an inner and outer layer of virgin plastic. HDPE and LDPE are often recycled into new detergent bottles, trash cans, and
drainage pipes. For some of the most popular uses for recycled HDPE and LDPE,

629

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

minor color variations in the final product are not particularly important. For
other products, such as colored detergent bottles, variations in color would affect
consumer perceptions of the product, so presorting of recyclables by color can be
important.
While it is usually important for recovered plastics to be sorted carefully, some
applications are emerging that can use commingled plastics. Mixtures of plastics can
be shredded, melted, and extruded into useful forms. Plastic lumber, which can be
used for fence posts, siding, timbers, park benches, docks, and so forth, is formed in
this way. Plastic lumber is more expensive than wood lumber, but it resists insect
and weather damage better than wood. In countries such as Japan, which have little
timber, plastic lumber is enjoying a growing niche in the construction market.
PVC in the wastestream poses particular problems. As already mentioned,
small amounts can cause major contamination problems for recycled PET. It is also
a source of potentially serious air pollution problems if it ends up being burned. At
elevated temperatures, the chlorine in PVC combines with hydrogen to form toxic
hydrogen chloride, which can be emitted into the atmosphere. To help avoid these
problems, a new mechanical separation system has been devised that automatically
separates PVC from other plastics at the recycling facility. Whole or crushed plastic
bottles are moved on a conveyor belt past a sensor that detects the chlorine atoms in
PVC. When PVC is detected, air jets are triggered that kick the PVC bottles away
from the remaining containers.

Glass Container Recycling
The amount of glass in the municipal wastestream is one of the few materials that
has shown a decrease over time. In 1980, 15 million tons of glass entered the
wastestream, but by 1990, it had dropped to less than 13 million tons, which is
where it has remained through 2005. The impact of much lighter-weight aluminum
cans and plastic drink bottles is evident. Even at these lower current rates, that still
amounts to about 100 pounds of glass generated per person per year. The glass
recovery rate in the United State is about 22 percent, most of which is made into
new glass containers.
Of the glass used in the Unitd State, 85 percent is for bottles and jars of one
sort or another. The remaining 15 percent, referred to as durable goods, consists of
items such as window glass, fiberglass, mirrors, ceramic dishes, porcelain, glassware, ovenware, and light bulbs. The recycling rate for those durable goods is essentially zero, and, in fact, they are considered to be contaminants in container glass
recycling. Ceramics and heat-resistant cookware melt at much higher temperatures
than container glass, so they form solid or slightly melted chunks of impurities when
the two are mixed together in a glass furnace. Metal caps and rings left on bottles
also cause problems when they are mixed in with glass. Metals melt at lower temperatures than glass, and that molten metal can cause expensive corrosion problems
in the glass furnace itself.
Recovered glass that will be remade into new container glass needs to be separated by color: clear (flint), green (emerald), or brown (amber). Those colors have
traditionally been created with permanent dyes, but there are now colored polymer
coatings that can be applied to the outside of clear glass containers. If these coatings
would allow all glass used in containers to be clear, the need to separate by color as

630

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

well as the need to use care to prevent bottle breakage during collection (which
mixes bits and pieces of different colored glass together in the residue) would be
eliminated. An additional advantage of the polymer coatings is they make the container considerably stronger, which could allow bottles to be made even lighter than
they are now.
Once recovered glass has been separated by color, and the metal rings and caps
removed, it needs to be crushed into smaller pieces, called cullet. When significant
quantities of color-separated cullet are accumulated, it is usually shipped to container manufacturers to be remade into new glass bottles and jars. Glass has the unusual
property of being 100 percent recyclable; that is, the same bottle can be melted down
and remade over and over again without any product degradation. Moreover, cullet
melts at lower temperature than the raw materials from which new glass is made
(silica sand, soda ash, and limestone) which helps save energy.
Not all cullet is remade into containers. Some is used in a mix with asphalt to
form a new road paving material called glasphalt. Cullet can also be used as a road
base material in areas where suitable supplies of gravel may be limited. Other products that can be made using cullet include fiberglass, abrasives, reflective paint for
road signs (made from small glass beads), lightweight aggregate for concrete, glass
polymer composites, and glass wool insulation.

Aluminum Recycling
By some measures, the most valuable collectable in a municipal recycling program is
aluminum cans. A ton of aluminum is typically worth 10 times as much as a ton of
PET or HDPE, and it generates on the order of 20 times as much revenue per ton as
glass, steel cans, or newspapers. Even though it may comprise only 2 or 3 percent of
the total tonnage of collected recyclables, it often generates on the order of 20 to
40 percent of the total revenues. This economic incentive is directly attributable
to the fact that recycled aluminum uses only 2 to 3 percent of the energy required to
make new aluminum from bauxite ore.
In 2005, aluminum beer and soft drink cans made up 60 percent of the
3.2 million tons of aluminum in municipal solid waste. Almost half of those cans,
roughly 60 billion per year, are recovered from the wastestream and recycled back
into the production of aluminum. It is estimated that 95 percent of recovered
aluminum goes back into the production of the next generation of cans, with a turnaround time of as little as 90 days (Bukholz, 1993). The next biggest source of
aluminum in MSW is from durable and nondurable goods such as home appliances
and furniture, with almost none of that being recovered for recycling.
Recycling aluminum not only helps reduce the demands placed on landfills,
but doing so saves quite large amounts of energy as well. The production of new
aluminum begins with the mining of bauxite ore. Then, using a procedure known
as the Bayer process, impurities are removed, and the aluminum hydrates and
hydroxides in bauxite are converted to aluminum oxide, or alumina. Alumina is
then electrolytically reduced to aluminum metal. That electrolysis, known as the
Hall-Heroult process, consumes enormous amounts of electricity. On the average,
the energy required by the two-step conversion of bauxite to aluminum metal
requires 220,600 kJ/kg, while only 5,060 kJ/kg are needed to make it from recycled
aluminum—an energy savings of 98 percent (Table 12).

EXAMPLE 4 Energy for the Aluminum in a Can
a. Using the current 50 percent recycling rate for aluminum cans, find the
primary energy required to produce the aluminum in a 0.36 L (12 oz)
aluminum can having a mass of 16 g.
b. How much energy is saved when a can is recycled instead of being thrown
away?
c. What is the equivalent amount of gasoline wasted when one can is thrown
away (gasoline has an energy content of about 35,000 kJ/L).
Solution
a. The primary energy needed for the 50 percent of the can made from bauxite is
Primary energy (virgin) =

16 g/can * 0.50 virgin * 220,600 kJ/kg
1,000 g/kg

= 1,765 kJ/can
and the primary energy needed to produce the rest from recycled aluminum
will be
Primary energy (recycled) =

16 g/can * 0.50 recycled * 5,060 kJ/kg
1,000 g/kg

= 40 kJ/can
So the total for an average can with 50-percent recycled aluminum is
Primary energy = 1,765 + 40 = 1,805 kJ/can
b. Every time an aluminum can is not recycled, a new can must be made from
bauxite to replace it. The energy to produce the aluminum for a new can
from ore is
Primary energy (all virgin) =

632

16 g/can * 220,600 kJ/kg
1,000 g/kg

= 3,530 kJ/can

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

If the can is recycled, it can be melted down and made into the next new
can, which requires
Primary energy (all recycled) =

16 g/can * 5,060 kJ/kg
1,000 g/kg

= 81 kJ/can

The energy saved by recycling is therefore
Energy saved = 3,530 - 81 = 3,449 kJ/can
c. The equivalent amount of gasoline thrown away when a can is not recycled
is
Gasoline equivalent =

3,449 kJ/can
= 0.099L = 98 mL
35,000 kJ/L of gasoline

Since the can holds 355 mL, that is like throwing away almost one-third of
a can of gasoline every time a can ends up at the dump.
The analysis in Example 4 tells us the amount of energy needed to produce the
aluminum for one can, given the current recycling rate. It does not tell us the total
amount of energy required to make an aluminum can, however. As shown in
Figure 12, once an ingot of aluminum is cast, more energy is required to roll it into
sheets, to transport those sheets to the can manufacturing plant, to manufacture
the cans, and to transport used cans back to the plant that remelts the aluminum.
Table 13 provides an estimate that shows about 3,188 kJ of energy are invested in a
single 12 oz can, which is 75 percent more than the energy required to produce the
aluminum itself.

Other Metals
Metals can be conveniently classified into two categories: ferrous and nonferrous.
Nonferrous metals (aluminum, copper, lead, zinc) have little or no iron in them,
while ferrous metals do. In keeping with EPA definitions, the only metals we will
consider here are those that end up in the municipal solid wastestream as discarded
refrigerators, stoves, water heaters, and so forth. That excludes, for example, preconsumer scrap that is recovered during metal manufacturing, and it also excludes
old automobile and truck bodies that are crushed and recycled.

In 2005, 18.7 million tons of metals entered the municipal solid waste system.
Ferrous metals account for the largest chunk of that total, 74 percent. Aluminum is
the second largest at 17 percent, and the remaining 9 percent are other nonferrous
metals. All told, 37 percent of metals generated were recovered from the wastestream. Renewed emphasis on ferrous metal recovery has led to a rapid rise in white
goods (appliances) recycling, which is now about 90 percent. About half of the steel
and aluminum in packaging is now recovered. The recovery rate of “other nonferrous” metals is quite high, averaging 72 percent. That category is dominated by
lead, most of which is in car batteries, with 98 percent of that battery lead being
recovered.

Construction and Demolition Debris
Construction and demolition (C&D) debris is generated when new structures are
built and when existing structures are renovated or demolished. While the exact definition of C&D debris varies from state to state, it usually consists of the residues
from residential and nonresidential building sites, including wood, metals, gypsum
wallboard, roofing, concrete, asphalt. It often includes trees, stumps, earth, and rock
from the clearing of all sorts of construction sites, including public works projects,
such as streets and highways.
C&D debris is a wastestream that is considered to be separate from MSW
even though a significant fraction of this material ends up in MSW landfills. The
EPA does not track these wastes nearly as carefully as MSW, so consistent data are
hard to come by. One report, written in 1998, suggests an annual generation rate of
about 2.8 pounds per capita, which can be compared with the current 4.5 pounds of
conventional MSW (U.S. EPA, 1998). Table 14 shows a distribution of generation
sources, with residential debris accounting for 43 percent of the total, and nonresidential debris the other 57 percent. Most of the debris from residential sources is
generated during renovation; for nonresidential buildings, it is mostly demolition.
Typical construction waste for a new, detached, single-family, 2,000-squarefoot house is shown in Table 15. Most of building construction waste is relatively
clean, unmixed, nonhazardous material that is easily disposed of without harm to

soil or groundwater. As much as 95 percent of it can be recycled, but historically
only about one-fourth of it actually does get reused or reprocessed into new materials (Table 16). That low rate is starting to change, in large part because of the
green building industry. The U.S. Green Buildings Council created its own building

rating system called Leadership for Energy and Environmental Design (better
known as LEED), which recognizes buildings that have outstanding environmental
attributes. One portion of their rating system awards points for management of
construction waste (1 point for 50 percent recycling, 2 points for 75 percent, and
3 points for 90 percent).

Collection and Transfer Operations
After source reduction, and before recycling, comes the process of actually collecting
solid wastes and transporting them to resource recovery facilities, landfills, or incinerators. This collection and transportation of solid wastes accounts for roughly
three-fourths of the total cost of refuse service. In the past, collection and transport
decisions by professionals involved in solid waste management were focused on
selecting the proper number and size of trucks, choosing the most efficient collection
routes and schedules, locating transfer stations if they were to be used, and administering the whole system. With the growing importance of recycling and composting,
those basic operations have become more complicated. Now, a municipality may
have separate trucks, routes, schedules, and destinations for recyclables and compostable materials—all of which need to be coordinated with already existing refuse
collection systems.
A number of collection options are available for communities with recycling
programs. In some areas drop-off centers, typically located in convenient places
such as supermarket parking lots, accept recyclables that the consumer delivers in
person. These may provide the only recycling service in a community, which is often
the case for rural areas, or they may supplement curbside collection. Curbside collection systems vary considerably, and the collection vehicles that are used depend
on the degree of sorting that residents are expected to perform. It has been common
for a separate truck for recyclables to make its own collection run, but cocollection
systems in which a single truck picks up both recyclables and residential solid waste
are beginning to appear more often.

Collection of MSW
Conventional collection vehicles for municipal solid waste are distinguished by their
size, how they are loaded, and how much compaction of refuse they can accomplish.
Trucks designed for residential refuse service are usually rear-loaded or side-loaded.
Rear-loaded trucks more readily accommodate large, bulky items, and they tend to
be able to provide greater refuse compaction, while side-loaded trucks tend to cost
less and are often more appropriate in densely populated areas where collection
takes place on only one side of the street at a time. A range of sizes for either type of
collection truck is available, from roughly 6 to 40 cubic yards, but the most common capacity for municipal service is typically 16 to 28 yd3. Obviously, larger
trucks cost more, but they don’t have to make as many trips back and forth to the
disposal site, which can more than offset the higher capital costs. Larger trucks,
however, are also less maneuverable in crowded urban areas, and their weight may
exceed allowable limits for residential streets.

FIGURE 13 Examples of a rear-loading packer truck and a side-loading truck with an
automated arm to pick up trash containers.

Municipal solid waste at the curbside has a density of around 100 to 200 lb/yd3.
At those low densities, collection vehicles fill too fast, which means multiple, timewasting trips to the disposal site would be needed. Modern trucks, called packers,
have hydraulic compactors that can compress that waste to as much as 1,500 lb/yd3.
The ratio of the density of waste in the truck to the density at curbside is known
as the compaction ratio. Ratios of 2.5 to 3.5 were the norm in the recent past,
but newer generations of trucks are being offered with 8-to-1 compaction. Packers
come with a variety of loading options, including front-load, rear-load, and fully
automated side-loading packers capable of picking up cans at the curb (Figure 13).
Those side-loading packers may cost more, but the reduced rate of injuries to crews
who no longer have to lift heavy containers all day long can more than offset the
extra capital cost of the trucks.

Micro-Route Planning
Designing a route for collection vehicles to travel in order for every house to be
served with a minimum of deadheading (traveling without picking up refuse) is a
challenging task. While it is possible to analyze this problem mathematically for an
idealized neighborhood, the realities of one-way streets, dead ends, hills, traffic,
location of transfer stations, and other complications can make this approach too
difficult for practical implementation. Instead, a common-sense, heuristic approach
is usually taken. In a 1974 report, Heuristic Routing for Solid Waste Collection
Vehicles, the EPA outlined a set of simple guidelines that included some obvious
notions such as avoiding heavily traveled streets during rush hour, making routes

compact with streets clustered in the same geographical area, and routing long,
straight runs before looping. Other ideas are less obvious such as starting the run at
the top of a hill rather than the bottom so the load is increasing as the vehicle travels downhill. Recognizing the hazards and delays associated with making left turns,
the guidelines emphasize clockwise loops made up mostly of right-hand turns.
Dead-end streets therefore are better accessed when the vehicle encounters the street
on the right hand side rather than the left. One-way streets are best entered at the
upper end of the street. Figure 14 shows an example of a routing that tries to follow
these guidelines.

Direct Haul Systems
We can use some simple estimates to help gain a sense of how truck sizes and collection patterns might be planned. Consider Figure 15, which shows a basic collection system consisting of the garage, where collection vehicles are parked overnight,

638

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

the collection route, and the disposal site where refuse is deposited. Later, the possibility of incorporating a transfer station between the collection route and the disposal site to reduce lost time by the collection vehicles will be introduced.
To work up a basic plan for refuse collection, consider the following notation:

time spent at the disposal site dropping one truck load
time spent on breaks, and so on
total time for one day of refuse collection
number of runs from the collection route to the disposal site

No matter what, each day’s collection requires at least a drive from the garage
to the collection route, time spent on the route, a run to the disposal site, time spent
there unloading, and a drive back from the disposal site to the garage. More than
one run may be made between the collection route and the disposal site, depending
on how big the truck is, how many pickups are to be made, and how much refuse is
picked up at each stop. The following describes a single day of collection:
Tt = t1 + tR + t2 + td + (n - 1)(2t2 + td) + t3 + tb
Tt = t1 + (2n - 1)t2 + t3 + tb + tR + ntd

(2)

EXAMPLE 5 Time Spent Collecting Refuse
Suppose it takes 0.4 hours to drive from the garage to the beginning of the route,
0.4 hours to drive between the route and disposal site, and 0.25 hours to return
from the disposal site to the garage. It takes 0.2 hours to offload a truck at the
disposal site. The crew is given two 15-minute breaks per day and another
30 minutes is allowed for unexpected delays (total 1 hour). If two runs are made
to the disposal site each day, how much time is left in an 8-hour shift for actual
refuse collection?
Solution

Rearranging (2) and substituting appropriate values,
tR = Tt - t1 - (2n - 1)t2 - t3 - tb - ntd
= 8 - 0.4 - (2 * 2 - 1) * 0.4 - 0.25 - 1 - 2 * 0.2
= 4.75 hours left for actual collection

To decide how many customers can be served per day by one collection truck,
we need the average length of time needed to service each stop. A simple approach
suggests that the time per stop is equal to the average time that it takes to drive from
one stop to another, plus the time taken at each stop to empty the containers, from
which we can write
ts =

EXAMPLE 6 Vehicle Sizing
Continuing with Example 5 (two truckloads and 4.75 hours of collection per
day), suppose the pickup vehicle averages 5 mph between stops that are on the
average separated by 150 feet. Each stop collects from two households that each
put out two full 30-gallon (4 cubic feet) containers. It takes an average of 20 seconds to empty one container. How many households could be serviced per day,
and how large should the truck be if it has a compaction ratio of 3.5:1?
The time required to service each stop would be

Solution
ts =

150 ft/stop * 3,600 s/hr
d
+ ntc =
+ 4 cans/stop * 20 s/can = 100 s/stop
n
5 mile/hr * 5,280 ft/mile

At 100 seconds per stop, and 2 truckloads per day, the number of stops that
could be made per truckload is
N =

4.75 h/d * 3,600 s/h
= 85 stops/truckload
100 s/stop * 2 truckloads/day

The truck volume needed would be
V =

4 cans/stop * 4 ft3/can * 85 stops/load
nsN
= 14.4 yd3
=
r
3.5 * 27 ft3/yd3

So, you would choose a truck size that provides at least 14.4 yd3 of hauling
capacity. With 2 households per stop and 2 truckloads per day, the truck would
service 2 * 2 * 85 = 340 households each day.
The collection vehicle sized in Example 6 was based on an assumption that
each truck would make 2 runs to the disposal site per day. If the truck is large
enough, perhaps only 1 run per day to the disposal site would be needed. In fact, if

640

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

we rework Examples 1 and 2 using only 1 run, we find that a 35-yd3 truck could
serve 412 customers per day instead of the 340 found in Example 2. With 3 runs
per day, there is so much time taken up making trips back-and-forth to the disposal
site that the time remaining to fill a truck is so low that a 7.6-yd3 truck is all that
would be needed. This little truck would only be able to serve 270 customers per
day. So, the natural question to ask is, “which choice is best?” Should we design the
collection system around large, expensive trucks, which make fewer trips, or go with
smaller trucks, which are cheaper, but since they make more back-and-forth runs to
the disposal site each day they serve fewer customers per truck?

Economics of Collection
To decide on the truck size that would provide the cheapest waste transport, we
need to know the annual cost of owning and operating trucks, including the cost of
the crew that makes the pickups. Finding the annualized cost of each truck involves
using an engineering economy calculation in which the capital cost, amortized over
the lifetime of the vehicle, is added to the estimated annual maintenance and fuel
costs. The relationship between the purchase price of capital equipment, such as
trucks, and the amortized yearly cost is given by
A = Pc

annual cost ($/yr)

interest rate, discount rate (yr - 1)
amortization period (yr)

The quantity in brackets in (5) is known as the capital recovery factor,
CRF(i, n). One way to interpret (5) is to think of A as being annual payments that
would pay off a loan of P dollars in n years if the loan interest rate is i (the decimal
fraction representation of i should be used; for example, 10 percent should be entered as i = 0.10/yr). For example, a mid-size collection vehicle costing $180,000, if
amortized over a five-year period using a 10-percent discount rate, would have an
annualized cost of
A = $180,000c

0.10(1 + 0.10)5
(1 + 0.10)5 - 1

d = $180,000 * 0.2638/yr = $47,484/yr

These vehicles are heavy, and their start-and-stop driving pattern leads to very low fuel
efficiency—less than 2 miles per gallon is typical. An average truck driven 50 miles per
day, 260 days per year, at 2 mpg and $3.00 per gallon would cost almost $20,000 per
year in fuel alone. If we add maintenance, insurance, and other costs, this typical
packer truck can easily cost on the order of $80,000 per year—not counting the labor
cost of the crew.
The annualized cost of a vehicle will depend on its size and usage, and one approach to analyzing its economics is to use a simple linear model such as the following:
Annualized cost ($/yr) = a + bV

(6)

641

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

where a and b are empirically determined estimates based on a survey of available
vehicles, and V is the volume of the truck. The following example illustrates how it
could be used to help make economic decisions about what size truck makes sense
for a given job.

EXAMPLE 7 An Economic Analysis of Refuse Collection
Suppose the annualized cost of purchasing, fueling, and maintaining a compactor
truck is given by the following expression:
Annualized cost($/yr) = 25,000 + 4,000V
where V is the truck volume in cubic yards. Suppose these trucks require twoperson crews, with labor charged at $24 per hour each (including benefits). Do
an economic analysis of the collection system in Example 6 in which a 14.4-yd3
truck collects refuse from 340 households each day. Each household generates
60 lbs of refuse per week. The trucks and crew work 5 days per week, and curbside pickup is provided once a week for each house. What is the cost per ton of
refuse collected and what is the cost per household?
Solution If we assume 8-hour days, 5 days/week, 52 weeks/yr, the annualized
cost of labor per truck would be
Labor cost = 2 person * $24/hr * 8 hr/day * 5 day/wk * 52 week/yr
= $99,840/yr
The annualized cost of the truck would be
Annualized truck cost ($/yr) = 25,000 + 4,000 * 14.4 = $82,600/yr
Total annual cost of truck and crew = $99,840 + $82,600 = $182,440/yr
Over a 5-day week, 1,700 households (5 * 340 = 1,700) are served by each
truck. The total amount of refuse collected by 1 truck in 1 year is
Annual refuse =

1,700 homes * 60 lb/week * 52 week/yr
= 2,652 ton/yr
2,000 lb/ton

The annual cost per ton of waste collected is therefore
Annual cost per ton =

$182,440/yr
= $68.80/ton
2,652 ton/yr

The annual cost per household for the truck and crew
Annual cost per household =

$68.80/ton * 2,652 ton/yr
= $107.32/yr
1,700 household

The total amount billed to each customer will be considerably higher after including transfer station fees, administrative costs, overhead, profits, and so on.

642

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

Table 17 extends the analysis of Examples 5, 6, and 7 to trucks making one
run or three runs per day to the disposal site. Under the assumptions made in this
analysis, mid-size trucks are optimum. Larger trucks make fewer runs to the disposal site, but their capital cost is too high. Use of smaller trucks holds their capital cost
down, but the extra time spent driving back and forth reduces the number of customers served, which more than offsets that advantage.
The solution represented by Table 16 is quite sensitive to the distance between
collection route and the disposal site. As that distance increases, having fewer trucks
driving that long distance only once per day begins to become the most cost effective
design, as is shown in Figure 16.

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

Transfer Stations
As convenient, local landfills close it is often the case that the replacement site is located many miles away from the community that is being served. As that distance
from the collection area increases, it takes more and more time to haul the refuse to
the disposal site, which leaves less and less time for each truck to actually collect the
wastes. At some point, it is better to construct a facility close to town, called a
transfer station, that acts as a temporary repository for wastes dropped off by local
garbage trucks. Larger, long-haul trucks are then used to transport wastes from the
transfer station to the disposal site.
Again, a design decision must be made. At what point is the disposal site so far
away that the added costs of a transfer station are justified? The problem we need to
analyze is shown in Figure 17. A procedure for deriving the cost-versus-distance
graph for direct haul from collection route to disposal site has already been demonstrated. What needs to be done now is an analysis of the transfer station and its
associated fleet of long-haul trucks.
The cost of a transfer station itself depends on many factors, including its size,
local construction costs, and the price of land. In addition, transfer stations can employ a variety of technological features that also contribute to costs. Simple transfer
stations may consist of just a lightweight building shell with a thick concrete slab
called a tipping floor. Collection vehicles drop their refuse onto the tipping floor
while a front-loader scoops it up and loads the transfer vehicles. More complex
facilities may include hoppers for direct deposit of refuse from collection vehicles
into transfer vehicles. They may also have compaction equipment to compress the
wastes before loading. Some transfer stations compress wastes into dense bales
(1,000 lb/yd3) that can be loaded with forklifts onto flatbed trucks. Baled refuse is
especially convenient for rail or barge transport.
Trucks that haul wastes from transfer stations to the disposal site are usually
large tractor-trailer vehicles. The trailers may be open-topped or closed, but closed

644

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

trailers are preferred since they are less likely to spread debris along the highway
and the wastes can be more easily compacted in the trailer. Open trailers carry on
the order of 40 to 120 cubic yards of refuse with densities of 200 to 300 lb/yd3.
Since the density of wastes in closed trailers may be higher (500 to 800 lb/yd3),
closed trailers are usually smaller (40 to 80 yd3) in order to keep the total vehicle
weight below highway load limits.
EXAMPLE 8 Costs of a Transfer Station and Its Vehicles
A transfer station handling 300 tons/day, 5 days per week, costs $5 million to
build and $150,000 per year to operate. An individual tractor-trailer costs
$140,000 and carries 15 tons per trip. Operation and maintenance costs (including fuel) of the truck are $50,000/yr; the driver makes $40,000 per year (including benefits). The capital costs of the building and transfer trucks are to be
amortized over a 10-year period using a 12 percent discount factor.
Suppose it takes 30 minutes to make a one-way trip from the transfer
station to the disposal site, and 7 round trips per day are made. Find the transferstation and hauling cost in dollars per ton.
Solution Using (5), the capital recovery factor for a 10-year amortization
period and 12 percent discount factor is
CRF =

i(1 + i)n
0.12(1 + 0.12)10
=
= 0.1770/yr
n
(1 + i) - 1
(1 + 0.12)10 - 1

The annualized cost of the transfer station is therefore
$5,000,000 * 0.1770/yr + $150,000/yr = $1,035,000/yr
Per ton of waste, that works out to be
$1,035,000/yr
300 ton/day * 5 days/week * 52 weeks/yr
= $13.27/ton

Transfer station cost =

The annualized cost of a single truck and its driver is
$140,000 * 0.177/yr + $50,000/yr + $40,000/yr = $114,780/yr
Per ton of waste hauled, the truck and driver cost
Truck and driver cost =

$114,780/yr
= $4.20/ton
15 ton/trip * 7 trip/day * 260 day/yr

Total cost of transfer station, trucks and driver is therefore
Total cost = $13.27 + $4.20 = $17.47/ton
In Example 8, the $4.20/ton trucking cost was worked out for a particular
trip time from the transfer station to the disposal site of .5 hours each way. That is,
it is $4.20/ton per .5 hours of distance between transfer station and disposal site, or
$8.40 per hour of distance. The transfer station itself has a fixed cost of $13.27/ton.

645

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

By varying that trip time, we will get a variable trucking cost that we can add to
the fixed annual cost of the transfer station itself, resulting in the graph shown in
Figure 18.
We can now compare the economics associated with garbage trucks making
their daily pick-ups and delivering their loads all the way to a disposal site with the

economics of a delivery to a much closer, but costly, local transfer station. To continue our example, let’s combine the example for the costs of collection shown in
Figure 16 with the costs of a transfer station shown in Figure 18. If we assume an
ideal site for a local transfer station is 0.3 hours from town, the decision graph for
whether or not to add a transfer station is shown in Figure 19. For one-way run
times from route to ultimate disposal site above about 0.75 hours, including a transfer station is the cheapest option. These results, of course, are specific to the
example presented. They should, however, give a sense of the trade-offs that need to
be evaluated in actual decision making.

Materials Recovery Facilities and Economics
Recyclable materials need to be sorted to separate the glass, plastics, newspapers,
cans, and so forth. If a community has a recycling system in place, some of this separation is usually done by consumers, some may be done by the crew of the recycling truck as they make their pick-ups, and some is typically done at a materials
recovery facility (MRF). If there is no recycling system geared toward consumers
(that is, materials that could be recycled are mixed in with all of the other refuse collected), there still may be some attempt at recovery. A facility that tries to recover
recyclable materials that are mixed in with all the usual municipal solid waste is
referred to as a waste processing facility (WPF) or sometimes as a front-end processing system. These definitions are not precise; for example, a not uncommon collection system has consumers put their commingled recyclables into separate (usually
blue) bags, which are tossed into the truck with the rest of the mixed waste. The
blue color of those bags helps them visually stand out from dark green, plastic
garbage bags, which facilitates their removal at a processing facility.
The primary function of a materials recovery facility is to separate bottles by
color, plastics by resin, cans by their metal content, as well as old newspapers
(ONP), old corrugated containers (OCC), and compostable organics. The second
function is to densify those separated materials so that they can be more easily
shipped to end users. Densification includes crushing bottles, flattening metal cans,
granulating and baling plastics, and baling waste paper.
Since different communities have differing degrees of preseparation by consumers and truck crews, materials recovery facilities also have a range of equipment
and processes. Almost all will include a significant amount of hand separation supplemented by varying amounts of automated equipment. Smaller facilities tend to
use more labor since they may not process enough waste to justify the cost of automated equipment, but even large automated facilities use workers for some amount
of handpicking and quality control. An example MRF is illustrated in Figure 20.
The usual MRF is designed to receive old newspapers and corrugated cardboard that have already been separated from the bottles, cans, plastics, and glass.
This not only simplifies processing, but it helps reduce contamination of paper products from food and chemical wastes that may accompany the other recyclables. A
separate area of the tipping floor, with its own conveyor belt, receives newspapers
and cardboard. Sorters stand by the conveyor belt, removing cardboard, which will
be baled later, along with paper and plastic bags, string, and other foreign materials,
which are discarded. Newspapers remain on the belt and are fed into a bailer that

compacts them and wraps them with wire to form bales. A typical bale is approximately 0.75 m by 1.2 m by 1.5 m (30 ⫻ 48 ⫻ 60 inches). The same baler can be used
to make bales of corrugated cardboard, PET, HDPE, aluminum, or ferrous metals.
This removal of specific items, such as cardboard, from the conveyor is referred to
as “positive sorting,” to distinguish it from “negative sorting,” in which the product
in question, say newspaper, is left on the conveyor belt.
Another conveyor belt has sorters who push bottles, cans, and other objects
into individual hoppers. Since plastics are voluminous and lightweight, they tend to
stay on top so they are usually pushed into the appropriate hoppers first. To avoid
mixing resins, at least three hoppers are needed: HDPE, PET, and mixed plastics.
More careful separation would have hoppers for HDPE, green PET, clear PET, PVC,
and mixed residue. The plastics may be fed into a granulator, or knife shredder,
which cuts them into pieces roughly 1 cm in size. Or, they may be crushed and baled.
As was mentioned earlier, PVC is a particularly critical contaminant of PET, and it
can also be a source of chlorine emissions if burned, so sorters must keep a careful
watch for it. Manual separation is difficult since PVC and PET are visually very similar. Mechanical sorters which remove PVC are now available, however. In one such
sorter, plastic bottles pass over a detector array that can sense the presence of chlorine atoms in PVC bottles. When chlorine is detected, air jets blow the PVC bottles
over a partition away from the remaining materials. Another sorting technology
analyzes light that has been transmitted through plastic bottles to identify the type
of resin and color.
Ferrous metals can be removed from the conveyor belt by hand, or magnets
can pull them off. One version of a magnetic separator uses a stationary magnet that
is suspended above the main conveyor belt. The magnet draws the ferrous metals to
another belt running perpendicular to the main conveyor and then drops them into
their hopper. Some aluminum, either from bimetal cans having ferrous metal sides

648

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

and aluminum lids, or aluminum cans that get wedged in steel cans, will end up in
the ferrous metal hopper. This aluminum contamination reduces the value the recycled metal when the product is sold to detinning plants, but the aluminum can actually be somewhat beneficial in steelmaking.
Aluminum cans and aluminum food trays can be picked off the conveyor by
hand, as is usually the case in a small MRF, but it is also possible to do this using an
eddy-current separator. When good electrical conductors, such as aluminum, are
placed in a changing magnetic field, small eddy currents are created in the conductor. Those eddy currents, in turn, create their own magnetic field, which interacts
with the field created by the magnets. That interaction generates a force that can be
used to nudge aluminum out of the wastestream. Other metals, such as copper, will
also experience forces induced by eddy currents, but they are much heavier than aluminum and aren’t moved as easily. One version of an eddy current separator has the
materials to be separated sliding down a ramp under a series of alternating polarity
permanent magnets. As the aluminum slides under these magnets it experiences a
changing magnetic field, which results in eddy-current forces that push the aluminum to one side of the ramp. Nonconductors slide straight down the ramp, so
separation is achieved.
Bottles need to be separated by color, into clear, green, and brown. Prior to
color separation, it is important to avoid breakage, but afterwards, the glass is purposely crushed. Vibrating screens, which allow the crushed glass to fall through the
openings, can be used to help remove larger, unwanted contaminants such as bottle
caps, labels, and other debris.

Processing Equipment for Commingled Wastes
Many communities collect commingled recyclables and mixed wastes. Such wastes
could be landfilled as collected, but they contain valuable resources that should be
recovered. Not only can recyclables be removed, but combustible products can be
prepared for waste-to-energy incineration, and materials to be landfilled can be densified to take up less space. Processing facilities that handle such mixtures may utilize a combination of large, heavy-duty machines to screen, shred, separate, and
classify the waste as is suggested in Figure 21.
Raw solid waste consists of a mix of boxes, bags, newspapers, food waste,
chunks of wood, bottles, cans, garden clippings, tires, and so forth, with varying
sizes and shapes. To facilitate recovery of various components of the waste it must
be broken down into smaller pieces. A combination of machines that screen and
shred the waste accomplish this task.

Screening. Figure 21 suggests a simple screening of the waste as a first step,
though this is not always the case. The most common screen is a large-diameter,
tilted, rotating drum with appropriately sized holes, called a trommel. These drums
have a diameter of roughly 1 meter to 3 meters, and the holes are often about 10 cm
across—big enough to let most of the metal and glass fall through but too small to
pass much of the paper and larger objects. The rate of rotation is such that particles
move at least halfway up the side of the drum before falling back. If the speed is too
high, centrifugal forces can hold the wastes against the drum so they never fall back
to the bottom. Typical rotation speeds are on the order of 20 to 30 rpm. A sketch of
a trommel is shown in Figure 22a.
Shredding. Shredders are brute-force machines that pound, crush, pulverize, and
shred the wastes. A number of types of shredders are available, but the one most
commonly used in recycling operations is the horizontal axis hammermill shown in
Figure 22b. Wastes dropped into the top are pounded by hammers until they are
reduced to a small enough size to fall through the bottom grate. As a way to help
prolong the relatively short life of the hammers, wastes are often prescreened before
the hammermill to remove objects that are already sufficiently small. Other types of
shredders include flail mills, which are similar to hammermills except the hammers
are more like knives, and there are no grates, so materials make only one pass by the

hammers. There are also knife shredders, which slice up objects like rags and bottles; shear shredders, with counterrotating blades that cut materials into strips; and
pulverizers that crush glass. Even if there is no materials recovery, shredding has several advantages when used as a precursor to landfilling. Shredded refuse compacts
better within a landfill, reducing the storage volume needed. Moreover, shredded
waste in a landfill may not need daily covering with earth when spread in thin
enough layers to maintain aerobic conditions, which controls odors. Since it is relatively dry, and there are no large food particles, rat and insect problems are also
minimized without daily covering.
Magnetic Separators. After materials have been broken into small enough particles, they can be passed by magnets to remove ferrous metals. A number of design
variations are possible, but they are all similar in nature. Ferrous metals are picked
up by the magnet and moved away from the remaining materials on the main conveyor belt. Figure 22c shows one version of a magnetic separator.
Air Classification. Once the wastestream has been reduced to relatively small
particle sizes, a blast of air, along with gravity, can be used to separate heavy particles from light ones. In one version of an air classifier, called an air knife, light particles such as plastic and paper are blown over barriers that separate a number of
collection bins. Heavy particles are not affected much by the air stream, so they fall
into the first hopper. The air knife shown in Figure 22d has two receiving bins, but
more are possible if more sensitive separation is needed.

Economics of Recycling
While the environmental and resource values of recycling are clear, the economic viability under constantly fluctuating market and regulatory conditions is less certain.
To make an economic assessment we need to explore the collection costs, the cost
of materials processing, the market value of recycled materials, and the tipping
fees avoided by reducing the amount of waste that ends up at the local landfill or
incinerator.
To a significant extent, there is a trade-off between the cost of collection and
the cost of processing. For example, separate collection of source-separated recyclables is expensive, but the processing that follows collection is relatively cheap.
Moreover, overall resource recovery rates may be lower if consumers balk at being
asked to do most of the source separation. At the other extreme, using the same
packer to pick up recyclables and mixed waste cuts collection costs, but raises the
cost of processing. In this case, everyone participates whether they like it or not, so
potential recovery rates are high. Also complicating the economics is the trade-off
between extensive hand sorting at the materials recovery facility, common when volumes are low, and mechanized sorting, which predominates larger operations.
Finally, data on costs is hard to come by, difficult to interpret, and often based on
widely varying assumptions and accounting practices.
The big economic question is, of course, how does the cost of collection and
processing recyclables, which seems to be very roughly around $180 per ton ($120
for collection, $60 for MRF), compare with the revenues received when the recovered materials are sold? Unfortunately, that comparison is not a simple one for the

general case. Prices vary considerably over time, both within a given year, and from
year to year. For example, prices for recycled aluminum cans tend to rise in the
spring as can-makers prepare for the heavy summer demand for beverages. In the
fall, prices drop as the supply of returned cans increases and demand drops. Prices
also vary from year to year, sometimes by large amounts. For example, there was little demand for recycled paper in the early 1990s, and paper processors often had to
pay mills to take it off their hands. Stimulated in part by President Clinton’s 1993
executive order directing every federal agency to purchase printing and writing
paper containing at least 20 percent postconsumer material by the end of 1994, and
30 percent by the end of 1998, the recycled paper market suddenly exploded
(Figure 23). In 1995, it was not uncommon for mills to be paying $140 per ton of
mixed paper that had in previous years brought only $25 per ton. The market
quickly saturated, and the price collapsed a few years later. After various oscillations
in price, in 2005, mixed paper was selling for about $75 per ton.
Given the uncertainties in prices paid for recycled materials, it is difficult to do
an economic analysis of recycling that will be valid for any length of time or for any
location in general. Nonetheless, it is worth sketching out a simple example to suggest the approach. Table 18 combines representative 2005 prices for recovered materials with an estimate of the relative amounts of various materials typically
recovered from MSW. The product of the two gives the revenue derived from the
sale of each recovered material. For example, revenue from sale of recovered corrugated cardboard is $40.50 per ton of recovered MSW. Aluminum cans, with much
less mass, provide $24 per ton of recovered MSW.
The total revenue from the sale of all recovered materials in the example is
$107 per ton. If we use an estimate of $180/ton to collect and process recyclables,
the net cost of recycling would be $73 per ton. Is this good or bad? To answer that
question, we must estimate the cost of collecting MSW and sending it to the local
landfill. As a rough estimate, let’s say ordinary MSW collection without recycling
costs $100/ton. Add to that the cost of disposing waste in a landfill (called the tipping charge). With a tipping charge of $50/ton, the total cost to dispose of ordinary

MSW is $150/ton. Compared to our estimate of $73 per ton to recycle, it would appear that recycling saves us $77 per ton of recovered materials. This is not a robust
conclusion, however, since there are simply too many uncertainties and variations in
the numbers used here to justify a strong general statement, but it is encouraging.

Recycling and Carbon Credits
It seems likely that sometime in the near future pouring greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere will no longer be cost free. It is easy to imagine a carbon trading
scheme, such as the one established with the Kyoto Protocol, that would give value
to carbon-saving technologies. By avoiding carbon emissions, recovering and recycling resources from MSW could very well earn carbon credits that could add to the
economic value of recycling.
EXAMPLE 9 Carbon Credits for Recycled Corrugated Cardboard
Suppose 1 ton of recovered materials from MSW includes 0.45 tons of corrugated cardboard. By recycling that cardboard instead of landfilling it, greenhouse
gas emissions will be reduced. If carbon is traded (or taxed) at $50 per metric ton
of carbon equivalents, what would be the extra revenue associated with selling
that saved carbon?
Solution From Table 8, recycling one ton of cardboard reduces greenhouse gas
emissions by the equivalent of 0.96 metric tons of carbon. The greenhouse gas
reduction is therefore
0.45 tons * 0.96 metric-tons-carbon/ton = 0.432 MTCE
If carbon is trading at $50/MTCE, the value of this carbon savings would be
0.432 MTCE * $50/MTCE = $21.60

653

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

Table 19 extends Example 9 to the entire suite of recovered materials shown in
Table 18. For each of the recovered products, the carbon equivalent from Table 8 is
applied to determine the carbon credit earned by recycling. At $50/MTCE the total
carbon-savings revenue that would be realized is $43.34, which, when added to the
$107.35 received by selling the recovered materials, gives a total of $150.69. The
economic value of recycling would certainly be significantly improved by including
this greenhouse gas adder. Figure 24 extends this example to show the impact of
varying the value of the carbon credits.

Composting
Yard trimmings and food waste account for one-fourth of the mass of all municipal
solid waste generated in the United States. Prior to the 1990s, essentially all of that
ended up as discards sent to the local landfill or incinerator. As the remaining life of
landfills becomes more limited, and the difficulty in permitting new sites grows, it is
clear that source reduction and recycling programs need to be implemented for these
wastes as well as all the others. In fact, by the mid-1990s, over half of the population in the United States lived in states having regulations restricting disposal of yard
trimmings. The impact of those programs is beginning to be felt. The generation rate
of yard trimmings, for example, is dropping as more and more households implement backyard composting, and the recovery rate for yard trimmings is increasing
rapidly as municipalities implement their own composting programs. Notice the distinction between backyard composting, which is a form of source reduction since it
reduces the amount of waste that has to be collected, and municipal composting,
which is considered a form of recycling since it creates a marketable product out of
collected wastes.
Composting is the term used to describe the aerobic degradation of organic
materials under controlled conditions, yielding a marketable soil amendment or
mulch. It is a natural process that can be carried out with modest human intervention, or it can be carefully controlled to shorten the composting time and space
required, and to minimize offensive odors. The stabilized end product of composting is rich in organic matter, which makes it a fine soil conditioner, but the concentrations of key nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are typically
too low for it to compete with commercial fertilizers.
In the simplest composting systems, yard wastes (sometimes mixed with
sewage sludge) are stacked in long, outdoor piles called windows (Figure 25). A typical windrow might be 2 meters high, 3 or 4 meters wide, and tens of meters long.
Their length is determined by the rate of input of new materials, the length of time
that materials need for decomposition, and the cross-sectional area of the pile. More
complex systems use biological reactor vessels. Some systems involve both technologies: reactor vessels are used to start the decomposition process, and windrows are
used to for the finishing stages.
The composting process is affected by temperature, moisture, pH, nutrient
supply, and the availability of oxygen. Bacteria and fungi are the principal players in

FIGURE 25 Composting piles, called windrows.

655

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

the decomposition process, but macroorganisms such as rotifers, nematodes, mites,
sow-bugs, earthworms, and beetles also play a role by physically breaking down the
materials into smaller bits that are easier for microoganisms to attack.

Temperature
In the early stages of decomposition, mesophilic microorganisms (bacteria and fungi
that grow best at temperatures between 25 and 45°C) generate heat while they
metabolize the waste, which raises the temperature of the pile. When temperatures
reach 45°C, the activity of mesophiles stops, and thermophilic microorganisms,
which prefer temperatures between 45 and 70°C, take over the decomposition.
Inside the compost pile, temperatures continue to increase as long as nutrient and
energy sources are plentiful for the thermophiles. If the pile temperature stays above
55°C for more than 72 hours, most pathogens and weed seeds will be destroyed,
making a more marketable end product. Eventually, the nutrient supply drops,
thermophiles die off, the temperature falls, and mesophilic microorganism once
again dominate the decomposition process until stable end products are formed.
Figure 26 shows an example of this rise and fall of pile temperature.

pH
In the early stages of decomposition, organic acids are formed, which cause the pH
of the pile to drop to about 5. When the pH is this low, acid-tolerating fungi dominate. Eventually microorganisms break down the organic acids and the pile pH
rises, as suggested in Figure 26.

Nutrient Levels
A number of nutrients must be available to the microorganisms that are attacking
and degrading the compost pile. The most important nutrients needed are carbon

for energy, nitrogen for protein synthesis, and phosphorus and potassium for cell
reproduction and metabolism. In addition, a number of nutrients are needed in trace
amounts, including calcium, cobalt, copper, magnesium, and manganese.
One of the best indicators of the likely health of microorganisms is the ratio
of carbon to nitrogen available to them. An ideal C:N ratio is roughly 25 to 35
parts of available carbon to available nitrogen. High C:N ratios inhibit the growth
of microorganisms, slowing the decomposition. Low C:N ratios accelerate the rate
of decomposition but may cause loss of nitrogen as ammonia gas and rapid depletion of the available oxygen supply leading to foul-smelling anaerobic conditions.
Leaves, cornstalks, rice hulls, and paper are examples of materials that have high
C:N ratios, while grass clippings and sewage sludge have low C:N ratios.
Examples of high carbon content and high nitrogen content feedstocks are given
in Table 20.
By properly combining different kinds of solid wastes, the C:N ratio can be
brought into the desired range. Mixing dry leaves with grass clippings, for example,
helps balance the ratio, leading to rapid decomposition without foul odors. Sewage
sludge, which is high in water as well as nitrogen, nicely complements municipal
solid waste, which tends to be low in moisture and nitrogen. When composted properly, high compost temperatures not only kill pathogens, but they also promote the
drying of sewage sludges, which helps reduce the cost of sludge dewatering.

Oxygen
As aerobic microbes degrade waste, they remove oxygen from the pile. If the supply
of oxygen is insufficient to meet their needs, anaerobic microorganisms will take
their place, slowing the degradation process and producing undesirable odors.
Oxygen can be supplied by simply mixing or turning the pile every so often, or piles
can be aerated with forced ventilation.

657

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

Compost piles that are aerated by mixing need to be turned anywhere from
once or twice a week, to once per year. More frequent turning speeds the composting process and helps prevent anaerobic conditions, but may cause the pile to dry
out or cool down too much. Such turned windrows can complete the composting of
yard trimmings in roughly three months to one year. Composting can be speeded up
(which also reduces the land area required) by incorporating a forced aeration system. Wastes are stacked on top of a grid of perforated pipes and a blower forces air
through the pipes and composting materials. Composting can be completed in as little as three to six months using this method.

12

Discarded Materials
Recall the definitions used to describe the flow of solid waste materials through our
society. Source reduction (for example, lightening containers) and reuse (for example, refilling glass bottles) are activities that reduce the amount of materials that
enter the municipal wastestream. What remains are referred to as MSW materials
generated. Some of those materials are recovered from the wastestream and recycled
or composted, leaving materials that are discarded. Those remaining discards are
burned or buried.
Table 21 shows historical quantities of various categories of materials discarded in the United States. The impacts of recycling and composting are evident.
Paper and paperboard discards are declining as are yard trimmings and ferrous metals. The ever-increasing use of plastics in our society, along with only modest efforts
to recycle, are reflected in the continued rapid rise in plastics discards.

Waste-to-Energy Combustion
The history of combustion of solid wastes in the United States clearly demonstrates
the controversial nature of this method of waste disposal. In 1960, a little over
30 percent of MSW discards were burned in incinerators solely as a volume reduction practice. That percentage dropped rapidly during the 1960s and 1970s, reaching a low of less than 10 percent in 1980. With increased emphasis on avoiding
landfilling and with better incinerators that were designed to control emissions
while generating useful steam or electricity, combustion of MSW has returned to
about 15 percent of MSW generation. As Table 3 illustrated, a number of developed
countries around the world rely much more heavily on incineration than does the
United States—especially if they have high population densities. Japan, for instance,
burns almost two-thirds of its wastes, while the incineration rate in western Europe
is roughly 30 to 40 percent.
In the early 1990s, the United States had 190 MSW-combustion facilities in
operation that burned about 30 million tons of waste per year. By 2000, that number had dropped to 102, and by 2005, it was down to 88. Those 88 facilities, however, are bigger and cleaner and they burn slightly more waste than those in
operation in the early 1990s. Most of these are located in the Northeast and South,
while the West has only half a dozen.
Incineration of MSW as a method of waste disposal has a number of favorable
attributes, including volume reduction, immediate disposal without waiting for slow
biological processes to do the job, much less land area requirements, destruction of
hazardous materials, and the possibility of recovering useful energy. There are tradeoffs. For example, it is reasonable to question whether burning paper for its energy
value, or recycling it to reduce the environmental impacts of virgin pulping, is the
higher use for the material. On the negtive side of combustion, poorly operated incinerators release toxic substances such as dioxins into the air, the ash recovered
may be classified as hazardous materials that requires special handling, and the
public has generally been reluctant to accept the technology—especially if a facility is being proposed in their own area. There is also a concern for whether incineration competes with recycling. Once an incinerator has been built, a reliable
stream of refuse to burn must be maintained to pay it off. There can be reluctance
then to expand a recycling program if it may reduce the fuel supply, and hence
cash flow, for the incineration system. In the general heirarchy of solid waste management, recycling is considered a greater good than incineration, so there are
advocates who feel it is important to write into an incineration contract the freedom to reduce the amount of garbage provided to the facility at any time, without
penalty or other economic risk, when that reduction is due to an expansion in
recycling.

Energy Content of MSW
The energy content of MSW depends on the mix of materials that it contains as well
as its moisture content. The standard test used to determine the heating value of a
material involves completely burning a sample in a bomb calorimeter and then

measuring the rise in temperature of a surrounding water bath. The result obtained
is known as the higher heat value (HHV), or gross heat value. Included in the HHV
is energy that was used to vaporize moisture, which is usually not recovered in normal combustion unless the flue gases are condensed. A more realistic estimate of the
energy that can be recovered during combustion is known as the lower heat value
(LHV), or net energy. Table 22 gives example higher heating values of various components of municipal solid waste “as received”—that is, without any particular effort to remove the moisture. For comparison, the energy content of fossil fuels is
also included in the table.

EXAMPLE 10 Energy Density of MSW Discards
Estimate the energy density in Btu/lb of “as received” discarded solid waste in the
United States.
Solution Using data given in Table 21 for discarded materials and data
from Table 22 for energy density, we can set up a table based on 1 pound of discards. We need to make a few assumptions since some data are missing. For wood,
we will use an average HHV of hardwood and softwood (7,300 + 6,500)>2 =
6,900 Btu/lb. Since the mix of rubber and leather is not given in Table 21, we will
use an average value of (11,200 + 8,000)>2 = 9,600 Btu/lb. For “miscellaneous
other” wastes, we will assign an energy value of 0. Also, metals and glass will be
assumed to have 0 heating value even though coatings on cans do provide modest amounts of energy.

Thus, typical discarded solid waste in the United States has an energy content
of approximately 5,977 Btu/lb (13,902 kJ/kg), which is about half the energy
density of coal and roughly one-third that of fuel oil. Notice the importance of
plastics, especially, and paper products as well.
The composition of MSW varies considerably around the world, and so does
its energy content. In developing countries, a relatively small fraction of the waste
consists of manufactured materials such as paper, metals, plastic, and glass, which
means that the percentage that is food waste is high—usually over 40 percent. Since
food waste has a relatively low energy density, the heating value of MSW in the
developing world tends to be lower than that of more industrialized countries. Khan
and Abu-Gharrarah (1991) have developed an equation that attempts to predict the
heating value of MSW based on the paper and food fractions, plus a term that
accounts for plastic, leather, and rubber.
HHV (kJ/kg) = 53.5(F + 3.6 CP) + 372 PLR

(7)

where F is food, CP is cardboard and paper, and PLR is plastic, leather, and rubber
in the waste mixture, all expressed as mass percentages. For example, Colombia,
with 56 percent food waste, 22 percent paper, and 5 percent plastic, leather, and
rubber, (7) would estimate the fuel value of its MSW to be
HHV = 53.5(56 + 3.6 * 22) + 372 * 5 = 9,090 kJ/kg
This result agrees with that given in Table 23, which shows estimates of MSW
energy density for a number of countries.
Only in unusual circumstances can the HHV of a fuel be captured. Usually the
latent heat contained in water vapor is lost to the atmosphere rather than being
captured by the power plant. There are two possible sources of that water vapor
loss: moisture in the wastes and hydrogen in the (dry) waste, which can react with
oxygen to form water. Using 2,440 kJ/kg as the latent heat of vaporization for water

(at 25°C), each kg of moisture that is vaporized and lost contains 2,440 kJ of energy. In addition, each kg of hydrogen in the waste itself can produce another 9 kg of
water vapor. The total energy lost in vaporized water is therefore
QL = 2,440 (W + 9H)

(6)

where
QL = latent heat of water vapor released (kJ)
W = kg of moisture in the waste
H = kg of dry waste that is hydrogen
If we assume all of that latent heat is lost out of the stack during combustion, the net
energy derived from the material burned, called the Lower Heating Value (LHV), is
LHV = HHV - 2,440 (W + 9H)

(7)

EXAMPLE 11 Lower Heating Value of MSW
Typical MSW has a moisture content of around 20 percent, and roughly 6 percent of the dry mass of MSW is hydrogen. Using the High Heating Value of MSW
found in Example 10, estimate the latent heat of vaporized water and the net
Lower Heating Value.
Solution In 1 kg of waste, there will be 0.2 kg of moisture, leaving a dry
weight of 0.8 kg. In that dry mass, there will be 0.8 * 0.06 = 0.048 kg of
hydrogen.

662

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

Using (6) the energy content of the water vapor released when 1 kg of waste
is burned is
QL = 2,440 * (0.2 + 9 * 0.048) = 1,542 kJ
If that heat is not recovered, the 13,902 kJ/kg found in Example 10 is reduced
to
LHV = 13,902 - 1,542 = 12,360 kJ/kg
Applying the useful conversion factor of 2.326 kJ/kg = 1 Btu/lb gives
LHV = 5,314 Btu/lb
Table 24 shows typical moisture and hydrogen contents of various components of solid waste. The values given for the Lower Heating Value are based on (7).

Mass Burn and Refuse-Derived Fuel
Combustion for energy recovery is typically done in one of two ways: Either MSW
is sent directly to a mass-burn incinerator, or it is preprocessed to produce a more
homogeneous product called refuse-derived fuel (RDF) that has much better combustion characteristics. About one-third of the capacity additions of late have been
RDF facilities and two-thirds have been mass-burn incinerators.
Figure 27 shows a sketch of a mass-burn, rotary-kiln furnace receiving refuse
directly from a packer truck. Heat recovery from the waterwalls, convection tubes,
and superheater provides steam that can be used for process heat or space heating in
nearby industrial facilities, or the steam can be used to generate electricity, which
can more easily be transported over long distances.

EXAMPLE 12 U.S. Electricity Potential from MSW
The United States discards roughly 167 million tons of MSW (Table 21). The
High Heating Value of those discards is about 6,000 Btu/lb (Example 10). A
mass-burn waste-to-energy facility can convert those wastes to electricity with a
heat rate of 17,000 Btu of thermal input per kWh of electrical output (roughly
20 percent efficiency). Estimate the electrical energy that could be produced per
year if all of our discards were used in this type of WTE system. Compare it with
the total that is now generated, which is about 4,000 * 109 kWh/yr.
Solution
Electrical output =

167 * 106 ton/yr * 2,000 lb/ton * 6,000 Btu/lb
17,000 Btu/kWh

= 118 * 109 kWh/yr
Fraction from MSW =

118 * 109 kWh/yr
4,000 * 109 kWh/yr

= 0.0295 = 2.95%

Refuse-derived fuels have had most of the noncombustible portion of MSW
removed, and after shredding and sorting, a relatively uniform product is produced.
An example flow diagram for a resource recovery facility that yields RDF is shown
in Figure 28. With the noncombustibles removed, the energy content of RDF is
obviously higher than that of unprocessed MSW. The typical range of heat values
for MSW is roughly 3,500 to 6,500 Btu/lb (8,000 kJ/kg to 15,000 kJ/kg), while the
RDF range is typically 6,000 to 7,800 Btu/lb (14,000 kJ/kg to 18,000 kJ/kg). Even

with these higher heating values, RDF is often used as a supplemental fuel in coalfired facilities that have been suitably modified. Such co-firing facilities tend to use
up to 20 percent RDF, with the remaining portion being higher energy-content fossil fuel. Fluidized-bed combustors are well suited to refuse-derived fuels since they
are able to burn a wide variety of fuels with combustion efficiencies that exceed
99 percent. Japan has more than 100 such incinerators, but only recently have they
been introduced in the United States.

Environmental Impacts of WTE
There can be significant environmental impacts associated with the solids and gases
that are produced during combustion. Solids are in the form of ash, which is made
up of bits of glass and metal, unburned carbon particles, and other inert substances
such as silica and alumina. Bottom ash is the residue that falls through grates in the
combustion chamber, or which drops off the walls of the boiler. Fly ash is made up
of solid particles that are carried out of the boiler by combustion gases. Fly ash
should be collected by particulate control systems such as scrubbers, electrostatic
precipitators, and/or baghouses. Since combustion is involved, there are all of the
usual criteria air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and carbon
monoxide to worry about, and in addition there can be emissions of various acid
gases such as hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid. Of special concern are emissions
of especially toxic substances such as dioxins, furans, polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs), metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
Dioxins and Furans. Dioxins and furans are chlorinated compounds that have
somewhat similar chemical structures. They both consist of two benzene rings that
are linked together with oxygen bridges. Dioxins have two oxygen atoms joining the
benzene rings, while furans have only one oxygen link, the other link being a direct
carbon bond. Figure 29 introduces the generic structures of dioxins and furans,
showing the conventional numbering system for the chlorine bonding sites.

FIGURE 30 Two of the most toxic dioxins, 2,3,7,8-TCDD and 1,2,3,7,8-PCDD.

With chlorine added to the basic dioxin and furan structures shown in Figure 29, two families of chemicals are created. There are 76 possible isomers of
dioxin, 2 of which are shown in Figure 30, and 136 possible isomers of furan.
The most common, and most toxic, of the dioxins is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-pdioxin, or 2,3,7,8-TCDD, shown in Figure 30.
Dioxins are highly toxic substances that are produced as byproducts of incineration, chemical processing, chlorine bleaching of paper and pulp, the burning of
diesel fuel, and the use of some herbicides. They are not manufactured for any commercial purpose and they appear to be entirely the result of human activities.
Dioxins have become rather well known to the public as a result of several incidents
in the 1970s. They were identified as the chemical that caused the death of numerous birds, cats, and horses when dioxin-laced waste oil was used as a spray to
control dust in Times Beach and other locations in Missouri in 1971. TCDD was a

666

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

contaminant of the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, which were commonly used for
weed control in the United States, and which were mixed together and used as the
defoliant Agent Orange in Vietnam. In 1976, an explosion at a chemical plant in
Seveso, Italy, released a cloud of dioxin that exposed workers and residents. These
episodes, tragic as they were, did help to provide data on carcinogenicity and other
health effects of exposure.
Dioxins do cause cancer in laboratory animals and, in 2003, EPA classified
2,3,7,8-TCDD as a human carcinogen with no known safe dose, or threshold,
below which it will not cause cancer. Dioxins also cause reproductive, developmental, and immune system problems in fish, birds, and mammals at concentrations that
are close to those humans experience. The ability of dioxins to affect cell growth
and confuse biological signals early in fetal development indicates the human embryo may be susceptible to long-term impairment of immune function from in-utero
exposure. Most of human exposure to dioxin is the result of airborne emissions that
settle on plants and grasses, and which make their way up the food chain into the
beef, dairy, pork, and poultry products that we eat. When dioxins land on water,
they are rapidly bioaccumulated in the food chain, which makes some freshwater
fish the most heavily contaminated human food source.
Most dioxins and furans are created during combustion, so incineration of
municipal solid waste (as well as hazardous and medical wastes) has to be done
carefully if emissions are to be minimized. When combustion occurs at temperatures
of over 900°C, with residence times of over one to two seconds, dioxin and furan
emissions from the furnace itself can be reduced to nondetectable levels. However, if
dioxin-furan precursers, such as hydrogen chloride, phenols, chlorophenols, and
aromatic hydrocargons, have not been completely destroyed during combustion
they can react in the presence of fly ash to form new dioxins and furans as the exiting flue gases cool. Complete combustion, combined with downstream emission
control systems, are therefore essential to achieve acceptable emission limits.
It is encouraging to note that dioxin levels in the fatty tissue of the average
American dropped from 18 parts per trillion in 1976 to less than 5 parts per trillion
in 1994. These gains are thought to have been achieved as a result of the ban on
PCBs in 1978; the ban on the herbicide 2,4,5-T in 1979; as well as improved control
of the production, use, and disposal practices for a number of other important chlorinated hydrocarbons.
Heavy Metals. Metals such as lead, zinc, cadmium, arsenic, and mercury are
part of the municipal wastestream and, when burned, become part of the gases and
particles that leave the combustion chamber, or end up as part of the ash residue. In
either case, their potential to contaminate the environment requires that they be
most carefully controlled. Removal prior to combustion, as well as after combustion, are both necessary parts of the control strategy.
The temperature at which these metals vaporize and condense is an important
characteristic that affects the ease with which they can be removed from the incinerator. During combustion, most metals vaporize into gases, which are difficult to
control. When those flue gases are cooled, however, metals with high volatilization
temperatures condense and adsorb onto fly ash particles, which simplifies their removal in particulate control systems. Metals condense and adsorb more readily onto
small particles, typically below 2 mm in size. Most metals are thus best controlled by

667

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

a combination of flue-gas cooling to below the condensation temperature, followed
by an emission control system that effectively removes small particles. A heat
exchanger, called an economizer, recovers heat from flue gases after they leave the
boiler, which not only increases the overall energy recovery rate but also cools and
causes condensation of most metals. The emission control system of choice for
control of metals is the baghouse since it outperforms electrostatic precipitators at
removing very small particles.
The most problematic metal in flue gases to control is mercury, which has the
lowest boiling point of all the metals. It is hard to cool flue gases enough to cause
mercury vapor to condense, so it may not be effectively removed by particulate control systems. This makes it even more important to focus attention on removing
mercury from the wastestream before incineration. By far, the biggest source of
mercury in municipal solid waste has been dry cell batteries, but that problem began
to ease after Congress passed the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery
Management Act of 1996. Other mercury sources include fluorescent lamps and
mercury thermometers.
Portable dry-cell batteries that power our flashlights, cell phones, laptops, and
every other portable electronic device contain a number of heavy metals in addition
to mercury, including cadmium, nickel, silver, and zinc. Americans purchase and discard over three billion of these batteries each year, which works out to about ten per
capita per year. Rechargeable batteries last longer and can significantly reduce the
rate at which batteries enter our wastestream. Lithium-ion batteries in our laptops
and potentially in our future battery-powered vehicles are considered to be nonhazardous waste. Attempts at community battery collection programs have met with
limited success but are certainly to be encouraged.
MSW Incinerator Ash. The ash from incineration of municipal solid waste is
collected as fly ash and bottom ash, both of which are contaminated with heavy
metals and dioxins/furans. There are two major environmental concerns with
respect to disposing of this ash. For one, it is the nature of ash that it can easily
become airborne, which increases the risk of exposure due to ingestion or inhalation. Secondly, when ash is disposed of in landfills it becomes exposed to acidic conditions that enhance the ease with which metals dissolve into the leachate. Of special
concern are the heavy metals, lead and cadmium, which are highly toxic and are
especially common in fly ash.
Until recently, fly ash and bottom ash were typicaly combined and disposed of
in conventional clay or plastic lined landfills, which is a much cheaper option than
disposal in landfills designed for hazardous materials. This practice was based on
Subtitle C, Section 3001(i) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA),
which exempts municipal incinerators from Federal hazardous waste regulation as
long as they do not burn hazardous wastes. In 1994, however, that section was
interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court to apply only to the waste itself, not the
resulting ash. Under their ruling, ash must now be tested and if it fails the toxicity test
it must be managed as a hazardous waste. Roughly 90 percent of an incinerator’s ash
is bottom ash that may not require disposal as a hazardous waste, but the remaining
10 percent, which is fly ash, is highly toxic and will almost always require special disposal. Mixing them together means the entire ash production may require expensive
handling and disposal as hazardous wastes, so that practice is being discontinued.

668

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

Of course, if metals are not in the wastestream, they won’t end up in incinerator ash. The need to keep toxic metals out of municipal solid waste, especially in
areas that utilize incineration, has become especially important.

Landfills
The image of the local dump, complete with flies, rats, gulls, odors, airborne bits of
paper and garbage, and a black cloud of smoke is well engrained in the consciousness of most of the public. The NIMBY reaction (Not In My Backyard) to proposals
for new sites, or expansion of existing sites, comes as no surprise then, even though
modern, engineered facilities bear little resemblance to that image just described. In
fact, one of the major impacts of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) on solid waste management has been the prohibition of such open dumps
as of 1984.
There are three classifications for landfills. Class I landfills, or secure landfills,
are those designed to handle hazardous wastes; Class II landfills, or monofills, handle
so-called designated wastes, which are particular types of waste, such as incinerator
ash or sewage sludge, that are relatively uniform in characteristics and require special
handling; and Class III landfills, or sanitary landfills, are engineered facilities
designed to handle municipal solid waste. This chapter will deal with Class III, MSW
landfills.
While landfilling continues to be the primary means of MSW disposal in the
United States, the “3Rs” of reduction, reuse, recycling are beginning to have some
impact, and the amounts landfilled have been on the decline since the late 1980s
(refer to Figure 6). The number of MSW landfills in the United States has been
declining rapidly of late as well. In 1988, there were 8,000 landfill sites around the
country; in 1995, there were only 3,200; and in 2005, that total had declined to just
1,650. Most of the sites closed were small, publicly owned facilities that were unable to meet new RCRA Subtitle D landfill regulations that went into effect in 1994.
What those statistics mask is the fact that newer facilities tend to be much larger
than the smaller ones they replace, so the overall capacity of landfills has actually
increased.
With closure of so many local, substandard landfills, coupled with the difficulty in siting new ones, it is not surprising that there are parts of the country that
face disposal capacity problems. New RCRA rules, additional maintenance requirements, and tight capacity constraints in the early 1990s caused a surge in tipping
fees charged when a truck drops its load at a landfill site. As shown in Figure 31,
these fees, which vary considerably from one part of the country to another, seem to
have stabilized somewhat in recent years. Notably, the average tipping fee for incinerators is about 80 percent higher than that charged at landfills. Figure 32 shows
typical landfill operations.

Basic Landfill Construction and Operation
Moisture in a landfill is critically important if the wastes are to decompose properly,
so it is an aspect of landfill design that receives considerable attention. The initial

moisture contained in the wastes themselves is rather quickly dissipated, so it is
water that percolates through the surface, sides, and bottom that eventually dominates the water balance in the landfill. Water percolating through the wastes is
called leachate, and its collection and treatment is essential to the protection of the
local groundwater.
RCRA Subtitle D regulations require MSW landfills to have composite liners
and leachate collection systems to prevent groundwater contamination. The composite liner consists of a flexible membrane liner (FML) above a layer of compacted
clay soil. Leachate is collected with perforated pipes that are situated above the

FML. A final cover over the completed landfill must be designed to minimize infiltration of water. During waste decomposition, methane gas is formed, so completed
landfills need collection and venting systems. The essential features of such a landfill
are shown in Figure 33.
The operational phase of a sanitary landfill is organized around the concepts
of cells, daily covers, and lifts. Each day’s wastes are received and compacted into
cells, which are then covered at the end of the day with a thin layer of soil or other
material. The size of a cell depends on the daily volume of refuse to be buried, but
typically they are on the order of 3 m (10 ft) thick (including daily cover) and their
individual area is determined by the amount and density of the compacted refuse.
Cells are covered each day, or more often if necessary, to prevent windblown spread
of refuse, reduce odor, control the amount of water entering the cell, and to control
rodent, bird, and fly access to the garbage. When a given active area of the landfill is
filled with cells, other layers, called lifts, can be added on top. Figure 34 illustrates
an active landfill with a second lift being added to the first.

671

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

Sizing a landfill requires estimates of the rate at which wastes are discarded
and the density of those wastes when they are compacted in the fill. The density of
waste depends on how well it is spread and compacted by heavy machinery making
multiple passes over the refuse. For municipal solid waste, the density in a landfill
will usually be somewhere between 800 and 1,200 lb/yd3, with a reasonable average
estimate of about 1,000 lb/yd3.

Estimate the landfill area needed to handle one year’s MSW for a town of
100,000 people. Assume per capita national average discards of 3 lbs per day, no
combustion, a landfill density of 1,000 lb/yd3, and one 10-foot lift per year.
Assume 20 percent of the cell volume is soil used for cover.
Solution
would be
VMSW =

From the data given, the landfill volume of refuse for 100,000 people
3 lbs/day-person * 365 day/yr * 100,000 people
1,000 lb/yd3

= 109,500 yd3/yr

Since only 80 percent of a cell is landfill, the volume of cell needed is
Vcells =

109,500 yd3
= 136,875 yd3/yr
0.8

The area of lift per year at 10-ft/yr of depth is
Alift =

136,875 yd3/yr * 27 ft3/yd3
= 369,560 ft2/yr
10 ft/yr

(8.5 acre/yr)

The actual sizing of a landfill would include a number of additional factors, such
as additional area requirements for access roads and auxiliary facilities, reduction
in landfill volume as biological decomposition takes place, and increases in compaction as additional lifts are included.

Decomposition in Landfills
When MSW is deposited in landfills, microbial decomposition breaks down the
wastes creating gaseous end products, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and various
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as well liquid leachate. The main focus of
environmental engineers has traditionally been on keeping leachate from contaminating groundwater, but more recently attention has shifted to the global warming
implications of keeping potent methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere,
capturing those emissions for clean power generation, and the potential for longterm carbon storage in landfills (Figure 35). To understand these issues, we need to
learn more about waste decomposition.

The decomposition of landfill materials can be thought of as a four-stage
process. As shown in Figure 36, these stages are:
I. Aerobic Phase: When wastes are placed in a landfill, there is enough entrained oxygen to allow aerobic decomposition to take place for the first few
days. Oxygen levels drop, and at the end of this phase, anaerobic conditions
begin.
II. Acid Phase: During this phase, anaerobic conditions prevail, and a twostep process begins. First, hydrolyzing-fermentative organisms produce
enzymes that break down complex organics such as cellulose and starch into
simpler products that can be fermented into hydrogen, carbon dioxide, fatty
acids, and alcohols. In the second step, those products are converted by
bacteria, called acetogens, into simpler organic acids, typified by acetic acid
(CH3COOH). As these acids form, the pH of the leachate drops, which can

allow heavy metals to be solubilized. The CO2 concentration in the waste
rises and small amounts of hydrogen gas H2 are produced.
III. Methanogenesis, unsteady: Another group of microorganisms, called
methane formers or methanogens, convert the organic acids into CH4 and
CO2. The pH begins to return toward more neutral conditions and the release
of heavy metals into the leachate declines. This phase can last for months.
IV. Methanogenesis, steady: The duration of each phase depends on the availability of moisture and nutrients, but typically on the order of a year or so
after a landfill cell is completed the generation rate of CH4 and CO2 settles
down into nearly equal percentages, which is the characteristic of Phase IV.
After many years, perhaps several decades, the decomposition process and
the rate of production of methane decline significantly.
The rate of landfill decomposition is affected by a number of factors, including
moisture, available nutrients, pH, and temperature. The amount of moisture available for decomposition is a critical factor, which has recently led to increasing interest in recirculating leachate and other liquids into the landfill in order to optimize
moisture content to accelerate decomposition and facilitate methane collection.
Under the assumption that CO2, CH4, and NH3 are the principal gases liberated during decomposition, an equation that describes the complete decomposition of
organic materials under anaerobic conditions is given by the following:
CaHbOcNd + n H2O : m CH4 + s CO2 + d NH3

674

(8)

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

where
n = (4a - b - 2c + 3d)>4
m = (4a + b - 2c - 3d)>8
s = (4a - b + 2c + 3d)>8
To use (8) to determine methane production from waste requires that we
first determine a chemical formula for that waste. Niessen (1977) has developed
estimates of the mass percentage of the chemical elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen that make up fully dried components of solid waste. Such a breakdown by elements is called an ultimate analysis, or elemental analysis. The following
example illustrates the process.

EXAMPLE 14 Estimating the Methane Potential of Discards
Suppose “as delivered” MSW discards include 67.3 percent decomposable
materials, such as paper, yard trimmings, food waste, textiles, and wood. Of that,
32.3 percent is moisture. An elemental analysis of the dried decomposable
components yields the following mass percentages:

Find the chemical formula for the C, H, O, N portion of the decomposables.
Then find the energy content of the methane that would be generated per kg of
discards. The HHV of methane is 890 kJ/mol.
Solution Starting with 1,000 g of as received discards, 673 g are decomposable. Of that, 32.3 percent is moisture, leaving a dry mass of
Dry mass of decomposables = (1 - 0.323) * 673 = 456.1 g/kg discards
which gives for each element:
Element

O
N

% of Dry Mass

Mass (g)
0.4417 * 456.1 = 201.5
0.0591 * 456.1 = 27.0
0.4250 * 456.1 = 193.9
0.0073 * 456.1 = 3.34
CaHbOcNd = 425.7 g/mol

Thus, for example, 1 g-mol of CaHbOcNd has 201.5 g of carbon, so using an
atomic weight of 12 for carbon, we can compute the moles of a as follows:
12 g/mol * a mol = 201.5 g,

so a = 201.5>12.01 = 16.8 mol

675

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

Similarly, using atomic weights of H, O, and N of 1, 16, and 14, respectively,
gives us
H:
O:
N:

1 g/mol * b mol = 27.0 g
16 g/mol * c mol = 193.9 g
14 g/mol * d mol = 3.34 g

b = 27.0 mol
c = 12.1 mol
d = 0.24 mol

So the chemical formula is C16.8H27.0O12.1N0.24.
We can now write the equation that describes the complete decomposition of
this material using Eq. (8)
CaHbOcNd + n H2O : m CH4 + s CO2 + d NH3

(8)

where
n =
=
m =
=
s =
=

(4a - b - 2c + 3d)>4 = (4 * 16.8 - 27.0 - 2 * 12.1 + 3 * 0.24)>4
4.17
(4a + b - 2c - 3d)>8 = (4 * 16.8 + 27.0 - 2 * 12.1 - 3 * 0.24)>8
8.65
(4a - b + 2c + 3d)>8 = (4 * 16.8 - 27.0 + 2 * 12.1 + 3 * 0.24)>8
8.14

So, complete decomposition can be described by
C16.8H27.0O12.1N0.24 + 4.17 H2O : 8.65 CH4 + 8.14 CO2 + 0.24 NH3
Notice that 8.65 mol out of 17.03 mol of gas produced (8.65 + 8.14 + 0.24 =
17.03) is methane. That is, 8.65>17.03 = 0.51 = 51 percent by volume of the
gas produced is CH4, 48 percent is CO2, and about 1 percent is NH3. That is,
landfill gas is about half methane and half carbon dioxide.
One mole of dried discards yields 8.65 mol of CH4. At 890 kJ/mol, that
equals
HHV of CH4 released = 8.65 mol * 890 kJ/mol = 7,698 kJ
To summarize, 1 kg of as received moist discards has 425.7 g of C, H, O, and
N, which makes up 1 mol of C16.8H27.0O12.1N0.24, and which produces 8.65 mol
of methane having an HHV of about 7,700 kJ.

The calculation performed in Example 14 assumes that everything that can
decompose, does decompose. This is an overly optimistic assumption. Excavations
of old dumps routinely find newspapers that can still be read a decade or two after
disposal. One reason for the slow decomposition is that landfills dry out, and without the moisture assumed in (8) the process proceeds slowly, if at all. From a
climate perspective, that is good since it locks up CO2 and CH4 that would have
normally been released into the atmosphere. Also, the calculation doesn’t provide
any insight into the rate at which methane is generated. Some models suggest onehalf of the total methane production occurs over the first 10 years, while 30 years
are required to generate 90 percent of the ultimate volume (McBean et al., 1995).
Methane is explosive when it is in the presence of air in concentrations
between 5 and 15 percent, so some attention must be paid to its management.

676

Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery

Within the landfill itself, there isn’t enough oxygen to cause such an explosion, but
when it outgases from the landfill there is some potential for it to cause problems if
it is allowed to accumulate under buildings and other enclosed spaces that are
located nearby. Methane is lighter than air, so it tends to rise. If there is an impermeable cover over the landfill, the rising gas creates pressure, which can cause it to
move horizontally hundreds of meters before emerging from the soil. Pressure relief
can be obtained passively, with simple perforated vent pipes that penetrate the cover
and extend into a layer of gravel above the wastes, or actively, with collection systems that suck the gases out of the landfill. Passive venting is no longer allowed in
large landfills because of strict air emission regulations.
Collected landfill gases are usually flared, which wastes the energy that could
be recovered, but it does help control odors and it does convert the potent greenhouse gas, methane, into carbon dioxide, which contributes less to global warming.
Only a few percent of MSW landfills currently take advantage of the energy in
landfill gases, but that fraction is growing. One drawback to use of landfill gases is
the relatively low heating value (about 500 Btu/ft3318,000 kJ/m34), which is about
half the heating value of natural gas. This results, of course, from the fact that only
about half of landfill gas is methane, while natural gas is almost entirely methane.
Raw landfill gas can be used as is, but it is highly corrosive, so some treatment is
usually required. It can be upgraded to a medium-energy-content gas by removing
moisture and some of the contaminants, while leaving the CO2 intact. In that form,
it can be used in steam or gas turbines to produce on-site electricity. Further upgrading is possible by removing the carbon dioxide, resulting in pipeline-quality gas that
can be sold for off-site use.
