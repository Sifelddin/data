Global Warming
The Complete Brieﬁng
Third Edition

Global warming and the resulting climate change are among the most
serious environmental problems facing the world community. Global
Warming: The Complete Brieﬁng is the most comprehensive guide available to the subject. A world-renowned expert, Sir John Houghton explores the scientiﬁc basis of global warming and the likely impacts of
climate change on human society, before addressing the action that could
be taken by governments, by industry and by individuals to mitigate the
effects. The ﬁrst two editions received excellent reviews, and this completely updated new edition will prove to be the best brieﬁng the student
or interested general reader could wish for.
  .  ,  is a former Chairman of the
Scientiﬁc Assessment Working Group of the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, Chairman of the UK’s Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution, Vice President of the World Meteorological
Organization, President of the Royal Meteorological Society, and
Professor of Atmospheric Physics at Oxford University. He was Chief
Executive of the UK Meteorological Ofﬁce from 1983 to his retirement
in 1991. As well as the previous editions of this book, he is author of The
Physics of Atmospheres (Cambridge University Press, in three editions),
and has published numerous research papers and contributed to many
inﬂuential research documents. Sir John and his wife Sheila live in
Wales.
From reviews of previous editions
‘It is difﬁcult to imagine how Houghton’s exposition of this complex body of
information might be substantially improved upon . . . Seldom has such a
complex topic been presented with such remarkable simplicity, directness and
crystalline clarity . . . Houghton’s complete brieﬁng is without doubt the best
brieﬁng the concerned citizen could hope to ﬁnd within the pages of a
pocketable book.’
John Perry, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society

‘I can recommend (this book) to anyone who wants to get a better perspective
on the topic of global warming . . . a very readable and comprehensive guide to
the changes that are occurring now, and could occur in the future, as a result of

human action . . . brings the global warming debate right up to date . . . Read
Houghton’s book if you really want to understand both the scientiﬁc and
political issues involved.’
William Harston, The Independent

‘. . . precise account of the science, accompanied by ﬁgures, graphs, boxes on
speciﬁc points, and summaries at the end of each chapter, with questions for
students . . . ranges beyond the science into the diplomacy, politics, economics
and ethics of the problem, which together present a formidable challenge to
human understanding and capacity for action.’
Sir Crispin Tickell, The Times Higher Education Supplement

‘. . . a widely praised book on global warming and its consequences.’
The Economist

‘. . . an interesting account of the topic for the general reader.’
Environmental Assessment

‘. . . very thorough and presents a balanced, impartial picture.’
Jonathan Shanklin, Journal of the British Astronomical Association

‘I would thoroughly recommend this book to anyone concerned about global
warming. It provides an excellent essentially non-technical guide on scientiﬁc
and political aspects of the subject. It is an essential brieﬁng for students and
science teachers.’
Tony Waters, The Observatory

‘For the non-technical reader, the best program guide to the political and
scientiﬁc debate is John Houghton’s book Global Warming: The Complete
Brieﬁng. With this book in hand you are ready to make sense of the debate and
reach your own conclusions.’
Alan Hecht, Climate Change

‘This is a remarkable book . . . It is a model of clear exposition and
comprehensible writing . . . Quite apart from its value as a background reader
for science teachers and students, it would make a splendid basis for a college
general course.’
Andrew Bishop, Association for Science Education

‘Global Warming remains the best single-volume guide to the science of
climate change.’
Greg Terrill, Times Literary Supplement

‘This very readable and informative book is valuable for anyone wanting a
broad overview of what we know about climate change, its potential impacts on
society and the natural world, and what could be done to mitigate or adapt to
global warming. To this end, discussion questions are included at the end of
each chapter. The paperback edition is especially good value . . . Houghton’s

compact book is an accessible, well-researched, and broadly based introduction
to the immensely complicated global warming problem.’
Dennis L. Hartmann, Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington,
Seattle, USA

‘I have no hesitation in endorsing this important book.’
Wilfrid Bach, International Journal of Climatology

‘. . . a useful book for students and laymen to understand some of the
complexities of the global warming issue. Questions and essay topics at the end
of each chapter provide useful follow-up work and the range of material
provided under one cover is impressive. At a student-friendly price, this is a
book to buy for yourself and not rely on the library copy.’
Allen Perry, Holocene

‘In summary I would thoroughly recommend this book to anyone concerned
about global warming. It provides an excellent non-technical guide on
scientiﬁc and political aspects of the subject. It is an essential brieﬁng for
students and science teachers.’
Tony Waters, Weather

‘This book is one of the best I have encountered, that deal with climate change
and some of its anthropogenic causes. Well written, well organised, richly
illustrated and referenced, it should be required reading for anybody concerned
with the fate of our planet.’
Elmar R. Reiter, Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics

‘Sir John Houghton is one of the few people who can legitimately use the
phrase “the complete brieﬁng” as a subtitle for a book on global warming . . . Sir
John has done us all a great favour in presenting such a wealth of material so
clearly and accessibly and in drawing attention to the ethical underpinnings of
our interpretation of this area of environmental science.’
Progress in Physical Geography

‘. . . this complete brieﬁng on global warming is remarkably factual and
inclusive. Houghton’s concern about planet Earth and its people blends well
with this his hopes for global cooperation in concert with the spirit of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.’
Choice

‘Throughout the book this argument is well developed and explained in a way
that the average reader could understand especially because there are many
diagrams, tables, graphs and maps which are easy to interpret.’
SATYA

‘. . . this book is the most comprehensive guide available. Ignore it at your peril.’
The Canadian Field-Naturalist

Preface to the First Edition

Climate change and global warming are well up on the current political
agenda. There are urgent questions everyone is asking: are human activities altering the climate? Is global warming a reality? How big are the
changes likely to be? Will there be more serious disasters; will they be
more frequent? Can we adapt to climate change or can we change the
way we do things so that we can slow down the change or even prevent
it occurring?
Because the Earth’s climate system is highly complex, and because
human behaviour and reaction to change is even more complex, providing answers to these questions is an enormous challenge to the world’s
scientists. As with many scientiﬁc problems only partial answers are
available, but our knowledge is evolving rapidly, and the world’s scientists have been addressing the problems with much energy and determination.
Three major pollution issues are often put together in people’s minds:
global warming, ozone depletion (the ozone hole) and acid rain. Although there are links between the science of these three issues (the
chemicals which deplete ozone and the particles which are involved in
the formation of acid rain also contribute to global warming), they are
essentially three distinct problems. Their most important common feature is their large scale. In the case of acid rain the emissions of sulphur
dioxide from one nation’s territory can seriously affect the forests and
the lakes of countries which may be downwind of the pollution. Global
warming and ozone depletion are examples of global pollution – pollution in which the activities of one person or one nation can affect all
people and all nations. It is only during the last thirty years or so that
human activities have been of such a kind or on a sufﬁciently large scale
that their effects can be signiﬁcant globally. And because the problems
are global, all nations have to be involved in their solution.
The key intergovernmental body which has been set up to assess the
problem of global warming is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), formed in 1988. At its ﬁrst meeting in November of
that year in Geneva, the Panel’s ﬁrst action was to ask for a scientiﬁc
report so that, so far as they were known, the scientiﬁc facts about global
xxiii

xxiv

Preface to the First Edition

warming could be established. It was imperative that politicians were
given a solid scientiﬁc base from which to develop the requirements for
action.
That ﬁrst scientiﬁc report was published at the end of May 1990. On
Monday 17 May I presented a preview of it to the then British Prime
Minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, and members of her Cabinet at 10,
Downing Street in London. I had been led to expect many interruptions
and questions during my presentation. But the thirty or so Cabinet members and ofﬁcials in the historic Cabinet room heard me in silence. They
were clearly very interested in the report, and the questions and discussion afterwards demonstrated a large degree of concern for the world’s
environmental problems.
Since then the interest of many political leaders has been aroused – as
has been shown by their attendance at two important world conferences
concerned with global warming: the Second World Climate Conference
in Geneva in 1990 and the United Nations Conference on Environment
and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The Rio conference with over 25 000 people attending the main sessions and the many
side meetings, was the largest conference ever held. Never before had
a single conference seen so many of the world’s leaders, and for that
reason it is often referred to as the Earth Summit.
Much of the continuing assessment of climate change has been focused on the IPCC and its three working groups dealing respectively
with science, impacts and response strategies. The IPCC’s ﬁrst report
published in 1990 was a key input to the international negotiations which
prepared the agenda for the UNCED Conference in Rio de Janeiro; it
was that IPCC assessment which provided much of the impetus for the
Framework Convention on climate change signed at Rio by over 160
countries. As chairman or co-chairman of the Science Working Group
I have been privileged to work closely with hundreds of scientiﬁc colleagues in many countries who readily gave of their time and expertise
to contribute to the IPCC work.
For this book I have drawn heavily on the 1990 and 1992 reports of
all three working groups of IPCC. Further, in putting forward options
for action I have followed the logic of the Climate Convention. What I
have said I believe to be consistent with the IPCC reports and with the
implications of the Climate Convention. However, I must also emphasise that the choice of material and any particular views I put forward
are entirely my own and should in no way be construed as the views of
the IPCC.
During the preparation of both IPCC reports so far there has been
considerable scientiﬁc debate about just how much can be said about
likely climate change next century. Some researchers initially felt that

Preface to the First Edition

the uncertainties were such that scientists should refrain from making any
estimates or predictions for the future. However, it soon became clear
that scientists have a responsibility to communicate the best possible
information about the likely magnitude of climate change, along with
clear statements of the assumptions made and the level of uncertainty in
the estimates. Like weather forecasters, their results will not be entirely
accurate, but can provide useful guidance.
Many books have been published on global warming. This book
differs from the others because I have attempted to describe the science
of global warming, its impacts and what action might be taken in a way
which the intelligent non-scientist can understand. Although there are
many numbers in the book – I believe the quantiﬁcation of the problem to
be very important – there are no mathematical equations. I have also used
the minimum of jargon in the main text. Some technical explanations
which would be of interest to the scientiﬁcally trained are included in
some of the boxes. Others contain further material of speciﬁc interest.
I am grateful to many who have helped me with the provision
and preparation of particular material for this book and to those who
have read and helpfully commented on my drafts. There have been
those who have been involved with the IPCC: Bert Bolin, the IPCC
Chairman, Gylvan Meira Filho, my co-chairman on the IPCC Science
Working Group, Robert Watson, co-chairman of the IPCC Working
Group on Impacts and Response Strategies, Bruce Callander, Chris Folland, Neil Harris, Katherine Maskell, John Mitchell, Martin Parry, Peter
Rowntree, Catherine Senior and Tom Wigley. Others I wish to thank are
Myles Allen, David Carson, Jonathan Gregory, Donald Hay, David Fisk,
Kathryn Francis, Michael Jefferson, Geoffrey Lean and John Twidell.
The staff at Lion Publishing, Rebecca Winter, Nicholas Rous and Sarah
Hall, have been most helpful in preparing the book for publication, especially in ensuring that it is as attractive and readable as possible. Finally,
I owe an especial debt to my wife, Sheila, who gave me strong encouragement to write the book in the ﬁrst place, and who has continued her
encouragement and support through the long hours of its production.

Preface to the Second Edition

Since the publication of the ﬁrst edition nearly three years ago, interest
in the issue of Global Warming and concern about it has continued to
grow. The Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) agreed
at the Earth Summit in 1992 has been ratiﬁed and machinery for its
implementation is gradually being developed. At the end of 1995, the
IPCC produced a further comprehensive report updating the 1990 report.
Although the main conclusions have not changed, much has been added
to the detail of our knowledge regarding all aspects of the issue, the
science, the impacts and the possible response. This revised edition takes
into account this further information from the 1995 IPCC reports.
In the ﬁrst edition I included a chapter, Chapter 8, with the heading
‘Why should we be concerned?’ which addresses the question of the
responsibility of humans for the Earth and for looking after the environment. In it I presented something of the basis for my personal motivation
as a Christian for being concerned with environmental problems. Although I believe that it is important that science is presented in the broad
context of human values, I realised that the inclusion of such a chapter
was something of a departure and wondered how it would be received.
Some have expressed surprise that in the middle of a science book,
there should be, unusually, a chapter of this kind which deals with ethical
and religious issues. However, it has been pleasing that scientiﬁc colleagues and reviewers of the book have referred favourably to the chapter
stressing the value and importance of placing environmental science in
the context of the reasons for its pursuit. For instance, John Perry, in the
Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, writes:
Many scientists, including avowed agnostics such as myself, will ﬁnd this
forth-right declaration of religious belief and divine purpose a bit startling
in an otherwise rigorously scientiﬁc volume. However, in a line of
argument that I have no difﬁculty whatever in supporting, Houghton
demonstrates that the domains of science and religion are simply
complementary ways of looking at truth. The former deals with how the
world works and the latter with why. In Houghton’s framework, we and the
earth are each other’s reasons for existence in a divine plan that we must
xxvii

xxviii

Preface to the Second Edition

struggle to understand but must inescapably follow. Thus, Houghton holds
that we have no choice but to care for the earth solicitously as its
‘gardeners’ in a ‘partnership with God’. His lucid precis of the complex
factual substance of global warming is an authoritative guide to the issue’s
scientiﬁc dimensions; his inspiring synthesis of science, faith and
stewardship is an even more illuminating handbook to its moral and ethical
dimensions. Together, they constitute a uniquely valuable Baedeker to one
of the most important issues of our science and our time.

In revising Chapter 8 for this edition, I have been somewhat more
objective and less personal – which I felt was more appropriate for student readers from a wide range of disciplines, for whom the edition is
particularly suited. As a didactic aid I have also included a number of
problems and questions for discussion at the end of all the chapters.
Some of my colleagues sometimes comment on how formidable is
the task of sewardship of the Earth feeling that it is perhaps beyond the
capability of the human race to tackle it adequately. I feel optimistic
about it, however, for three main reasons. Firstly, I have seen how the
world’s scientists, coming from very different countries, cultures and
backgrounds, have worked closely and responsibly in the IPCC to provide
a consensus presentation of the science of global warming. Secondly, the
technologies required to provide for greater efﬁciency in the use of fossil
fuels and for their replacement with renewable sources of energy are
available and, when developed on the necessary scale, also affordable.
Thirdly, my belief in God’s commitment to the material world coupled
with his offer of partnership in caring for it, makes stewardship of the
Earth an especially exciting and challenging activity.
In the preparation of this revised volume I wish to express again
my gratitute to the scientiﬁc colleagues with whom I have worked
in the ongoing activity of the IPCC and from whom I have learnt
much. My thanks are also due to John Twidell and Michael Banner
who have commented on particular chapters, and to Catherine Flack,
Matt Lloyd and other staff of the Cambridge University Press for their
competence, courtesy and assistance in the preparation of the book.

Preface to the Third Edition

Since the Second Edition seven years ago, research and debate on the issue of human-induced climate change have grown at a rapidly increasing
pace. Observations of climate during this period have provided further
information about the warming Earth and there has been substantial
improvement in the models that simulate both past and future climate.
Although the main messages regarding the fact of human-induced climate change and its impact have not changed signiﬁcantly (on the whole
they have been strengthened) more detailed understanding has been
achieved regarding the basic science (including the uncertainties), the
likely impacts and the imperative for action. Hence the need to update this
book.
In 2001 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
published its Third Assessment Report–even more thorough and comprehensive than the ﬁrst two. As co-chair of the scientiﬁc assessment
working group for all three of the IPCC reports, I have been privileged
to be a part of the IPCC process, which has been so effective in informing
the scientiﬁc community. Then, through that community, information has
been spread to decision makers and others regarding what is known about
climate change with some degree of certainty and also about the areas
where there remains much uncertainty. I have leant heavily on the IPCC
2001 Report in revising this text and wish to express my deep gratitude to
those many IPCC colleagues with whom I have worked and from whom
I have learnt so much. I have also beneﬁted greatly from my association
with the UK Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, which
has become the world’s premier centre for climate modelling research.
My especial thanks are due to those who have provided me with
particular new material; Peter Cox, Chris Jones, Colin Prentice and Jo
House for Chapter 3; Chris Folland and Alan Dickinson for Chapters 4
and 5; Tim Palmer and Jonathan Gregory for Chapter 6; Martin Parry and
Rajendra Pachauri for Chapter 7; Stephen Briggs for material regarding
Envisat for Chapter 9; Aubrey Meyer for Chapter 10; Mark Akhurst,
Andre Romeyn, Robert Kleiburg, Gert Jan Kramer, Chris West, Peter
Smith and Chris Llewellyn Smith for Chapter 11; and William Clark for
Chapter 12. John Mitchell, Terry Barker and Susan Baylis kindly read

and commented on some of the draft chapters. I am also particularly
grateful to David Griggs, Geoffrey Jenkins, Philippe Rekacewicz and
Paul van der Linden who assisted with the sourcing and preparation of
the ﬁgures. Finally, I wish to thank Matt Lloyd, Carol Miller, Sarah Price
and other staff of Cambridge University Press who have carefully steered
the book through its gestation and production.
In January of this year I attended the World Economic Forum in
Davos and engaged in discussion and debate regarding global warming
and climate change. Nearly everyone there accepted the fact of climate
change due to human activities and the need for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to reduce its impact. However, many participants knew little of the likely impacts of climate change or of the extent
of the action required to address it; they just believed that it was one of
those problems that would have to be addressed sometime. I hope that
this book will assist in making the necessary information more readily
available and so help to provide the foundation for the urgent action that
is required.

Chapter 1

Global warming and climate change

The phrase ‘global warming’ has become familiar to many people as
one of the important environmental issues of our day. Many opinions
have been expressed concerning it, from the doom-laden to the dismissive. This book aims to state the current scientiﬁc position on global
warming clearly, so that we can make informed decisions on the facts.

Is the climate changing?
In the year 2060 my grandchildren will be approaching seventy; what
will their world be like? Indeed, what will it be like during the seventy
years or so of their normal life span? Many new things have happened
in the last seventy years that could not have been predicted in the 1930s.
The pace of change is such that even more novelty can be expected in the
next seventy. It is fairly certain that the world will be even more crowded
and more connected. Will the increasing scale of human activities affect
the environment? In particular, will the world be warmer? How is its
climate likely to change?
Before studying future climate changes, what can be said about climate changes in the past? In the more distant past there have been very
large changes. The last million years has seen a succession of major ice
ages interspersed with warmer periods. The last of these ice ages began
to come to an end about 20 000 years ago and we are now in what is called
an interglacial period. Chapter 4 will focus on these times far back in
the past. But have there been changes in the very much shorter period of
living memory – over the past few decades?

Global warming and climate change

Variations in day-to-day weather are occurring all the time; they
are very much part of our lives. The climate of a region is its average
weather over a period that may be a few months, a season or a few years.
Variations in climate are also very familiar to us. We describe summers
as wet or dry, winters as mild, cold or stormy. In the British Isles, as
in many parts of the world, no season is the same as the last or indeed
the same as any previous season, nor will it be repeated in detail next
time round. Most of these variations we take for granted; they add a
lot of interest to our lives. Those we particularly notice are the extreme
situations and the climate disasters (for instance, Figure 1.1 shows the
signiﬁcant climate events and disasters during the year 1998). Most of
the worst disasters in the world are, in fact, weather- or climate-related.
Our news media are constantly bringing them to our notice as they occur
in different parts of the world – tropical cyclones (called hurricanes or
typhoons), wind-storms, ﬂoods, tornadoes and droughts whose effects
occur more slowly, but which are probably the most damaging disasters
of all.

The remarkable last decades of the
twentieth century
The 1980s and 1990s were unusually warm. Globally speaking, the
decades have been the warmest since accurate records began somewhat
over a hundred years ago and these unusually warm years are continuing
into the twenty-ﬁrst century. In terms of global average near-surface air
temperature, the year 1998 was the warmest in the instrumental record
and the nine warmest years in that record have occurred since 1990.
The period has also been remarkable (just how remarkable will be
considered later) for the frequency and intensity of extremes of weather
and climate. For example, periods of unusually strong winds have been
experienced in western Europe. During the early hours of the morning
of 16 October 1987, over ﬁfteen million trees were blown down in southeast England and the London area. The storm also hit Northern France,
Belgium and The Netherlands with ferocious intensity; it turned out to be
the worst storm experienced in the area since 1703. Storm-force winds
of similar or even greater intensity but covering a greater area of western
Europe have struck since – on four occasions in 1990 and three occasions
in December 1999.1
But those storms in Europe were mild by comparison with the much
more intense and damaging storms other parts of the world have experienced during these years. About eighty hurricanes and typhoons – other
names for tropical cyclones – occur around the tropical oceans each year,

Global warming and climate change

familiar enough to be given names. Hurricane Gilbert that caused devastation on the island of Jamaica and the coast of Mexico in 1988, Typhoon
Mireille that hit Japan in 1991, Hurricane Andrew that caused a great
deal of damage in Florida and other regions of the southern United States
in 1992 and Hurricane Mitch that caused great devastation in Honduras
and other countries of central America in 1998 are notable recent examples. Low-lying areas such as Bangladesh are particularly vulnerable
to the storm surges associated with tropical cyclones; the combined effect
of intensely low atmospheric pressure, extremely strong winds and high
tides causes a surge of water which can reach far inland. In one of the
worst such disasters in the twentieth century over 250 000 people were
drowned in Bangladesh in 1970. The people of that country experienced
another storm of similar proportions in 1999 as did the neighbouring
Indian state of Orissa also in 1999, and smaller surges are a regular
occurrence in that region.
The increase in storm intensity during recent years has been tracked
by the insurance industry, which has been hit hard by recent disasters.
Until the mid 1980s, it was widely thought that windstorms or hurricanes with insured losses exceeding one billion (thousand million) US
dollars were only possible, if at all, in the United States. But the gales
that hit western Europe in October 1987 heralded a series of windstorm
disasters which make losses of ten billion dollars seem commonplace.
Hurricane Andrew, for instance, left in its wake insured losses estimated
at nearly twenty-one billion dollars (1999 prices) with estimated total
economic losses of nearly thirty-seven billion dollars. Figure 1.2 shows
the costs of weather-related disasters2 over the past ﬁfty years as calculated by the insurance industry. It shows an increase in economic losses
in such events by a factor of over 10 in real terms between the 1950s and
the 1990s. Some of this increase can be attributed to the growth in population in particularly vulnerable areas and to other social or economic
factors; the world community has undoubtedly become more vulnerable to disasters. However, a signiﬁcant part of it has also arisen from
the increased storminess in the late 1980s and 1990s compared with the
1950s.
Windstorms or hurricanes are by no means the only weather and
climate extremes that cause disasters. Floods due to unusually intense
or prolonged rainfall or droughts because of long periods of reduced
rainfall (or its complete absence) can be even more devastating to human
life and property. These events occur frequently in many parts of the
world especially in the tropics and sub-tropics. There have been notable
examples during the last two decades. Let me mention a few of the ﬂoods.
In 1988, the highest ﬂood levels ever recorded occurred in Bangladesh,
eighty per cent of the entire country was affected; China experienced

in the region of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers in the United States,
ﬂooding an area equivalent in size to one of the Great Lakes; major ﬂoods
in Venezuela in 1999 led to a large landslide and left 30 000 people dead,
and two widespread ﬂoods in Mozambique occurred within a year in
2000–1 leaving over half a million homeless. Droughts during these
years have been particularly intense and prolonged in areas of Africa,
both north and south. It is in Africa especially that they bear on the most
vulnerable in the world, who have little resilience to major disasters.
Figure 1.3 shows that in the 1980s droughts accounted for more deaths
in Africa than all other disasters added together and illustrates the scale
of the problem.

El Ni˜
no events
Rainfall patterns which lead to ﬂoods and droughts especially in
tropical and semi-tropical areas are strongly inﬂuenced by the surface
temperature of the oceans around the world, particularly the pattern of
ocean surface temperature in the Paciﬁc off the coast of South America

(see Chapter 5 and Figure 5.9). About every three to ﬁve years a large
area of warmer water appears and persists for a year or more. Because
they usually occur around Christmas these are known as El Ni˜no
(‘the boy child’) events.3 They have been well known for centuries
to the countries along the coast of South America because of their
devastating effect on the ﬁshing industry; the warm top waters of the
ocean prevent the nutrients from lower, colder levels required by the
ﬁsh from reaching the surface.
A particularly intense El Ni˜no, the second most intense in the twentieth century, occurred in 1982–3; the anomalous highs in ocean surface
temperature compared to the average reached 7 ◦ C. Droughts and ﬂoods
somewhere in almost all the continents were associated with that El
Ni˜no (Figure 1.4). Like many events associated with weather and climate, El Ni˜nos often differ very much in their detailed character; that
has been particularly the case with the El Ni˜no events of the 1990s. For
instance, the El Ni˜no event that began in 1990 and reached maturity
early in 1992, apart from some weakening in mid 1992, continued to be
dominated by the warm phase until 1995. The exceptional ﬂoods in the
central United States and in the Andes, and droughts in Australia and
Africa are probably linked with this unusually protracted El Ni˜no. This,
the longest El Ni˜no of the twentieth century, was followed in 1997–8 by
the century’s most intense El Ni˜no that brought exceptional ﬂoods to
China and to the Indian sub-continent and drought to Indonesia – that
in turn brought extensive forest ﬁres creating an exceptional blanket of
thick smog that was experienced over a thousand miles away (Figure 1.1).

The effect of volcanic eruptions on temperature extremes

Studies with computer models of the kind described later in Chapter 5
provide a scientiﬁc basis for links between the El Ni˜no and these extreme
weather events; they also give some conﬁdence that useful forecasts of
such disasters will in due course be possible. A scientiﬁc question that is
being urgently addressed is the possible link between the character and
intensity of El Ni˜no events and global warming due to human-induced
climate change.

The effect of volcanic eruptions on
temperature extremes
Volcanoes inject enormous quantities of dust and gases into the upper
atmosphere. Large amounts of sulphur dioxide are included, which
through photochemical reactions using the Sun’s energy are transformed
to sulphuric acid and sulphate particles. Typically these particles remain
in the stratosphere (the region of atmosphere above about 10 km in altitude) for several years before they fall into the lower atmosphere and are

8

quickly washed out by rainfall. During this period they disperse around
the whole globe and cut out some of the radiation from the Sun, thus
tending to cool the lower atmosphere.
One of the largest volcanic eruptions in the twentieth century was
that from Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines on 12 June 1991 which
injected about twenty million tonnes of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere together with enormous amounts of dust. This stratospheric dust
caused spectacular sunsets around the world for many months following
the eruption. The amount of radiation from the Sun reaching the lower
atmosphere fell by about two per cent. Global average temperatures
lower by about a quarter of a degree Celsius were experienced for the
following two years. There is also evidence that some of the unusual
weather patterns of 1991 and 1992, for instance unusually cold winters
in the Middle East and mild winters in western Europe, were linked
with effects of the volcanic dust.

Vulnerable to change
Over the centuries different human communities have adapted to their
particular climate; any large change to the average climate tends to bring
stress of one kind or another. It is particularly the extreme climate events
and climate disasters which emphasise the importance of climate to
our lives and which demonstrate to countries around the world their
vulnerability to climate change – a vulnerability which is enhanced by
rapidly increasing demands on resources.
But the question must be asked: how remarkable are these events?
Do they point to a changing climate due to human activities? Do they
provide evidence for global warming because of the increased carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere
by burning fossil fuels?
Here a note of caution must be sounded. The range of normal natural
climate variation is large. Climate extremes are nothing new. Climate
records are continually being broken. In fact, a month without a broken
record somewhere would itself be something of a record! Changes in
climate that indicate a genuine long-term trend can only be identiﬁed
after many years.
However, we know for sure that, because of human activities especially the burning of fossil fuels, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has
been increasing over the past two hundred years and more substantially
over the past ﬁfty years. To identify climate change related to this carbon dioxide increase, we need to look for trends in global warming over
similar lengths of time. They are long compared with both the memories
of a generation and the period for which accurate and detailed records

The problem of global warming

exist. Although, therefore, it can be ascertained that there was more
storminess, for instance, in the region of the north Atlantic during the
1980s and 1990s than in the previous three decades, it is difﬁcult to know
just how exceptional those decades were compared with other periods
in previous centuries. There is even more difﬁculty in tracking detailed
climate trends in many other parts of the world, owing to the lack of
adequate records; further, trends in the frequency of rare events are not
easy to detect.
The generally cold period worldwide during the 1960s and early
1970s caused speculation that the world was heading for an ice age. A
British television programme about climate change called ‘The ice age
cometh’ was prepared in the early 1970s and widely screened – but the
cold trend soon came to an end. We must not be misled by our relatively
short memories.
What is important is continually to make careful comparisons between practical observations of the climate and its changes and what
scientiﬁc knowledge leads us to expect. During the last few years, as the
occurrence of extreme events has made the public much more aware of
environmental issues,4 scientists in their turn have become more sure
about just what human activities are doing to the climate. Later chapters
will look in detail at the science of global warming and at the climate
changes that we can expect, as well as investigating how these changes
ﬁt in with the recent climate record. Here, however, is a brief outline of
our current scientiﬁc understanding.

The problem of global warming
Human activities of all kinds whether in industry, in the ﬁeld (e.g. deforestation) or concerned with transport or the home are resulting in
emissions of increasing quantities of gases, in particular the gas carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. Every year these emissions currently
add to the carbon already present in atmospheric carbon dioxide a further seven thousand million tonnes, much of which is likely to remain
there for a period of a hundred years or more. Because carbon dioxide
is a good absorber of heat radiation coming from the Earth’s surface,
increased carbon dioxide acts like a blanket over the surface, keeping
it warmer than it would otherwise be. With the increased temperature
the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere also increases, providing
more blanketing and causing it to be even warmer.
Being kept warmer may sound appealing to those of us who live in
cool climates. However, an increase in global temperature will lead to
global climate change. If the change were small and occurred slowly
enough we would almost certainly be able to adapt to it. However, with

9

10

Global warming and climate change

rapid expansion taking place in the world’s industry the change is unlikely to be either small or slow. The estimate I present in later chapters is that, in the absence of efforts to curb the rise in the emissions
of carbon dioxide, the global average temperature will rise by about a
third of a degree Celsius every ten years – or about three degrees in a
century.
This may not sound very much, especially when it is compared with
normal temperature variations from day to night or between one day and
the next. But it is not the temperature at one place but the temperature
averaged over the whole globe. The predicted rate of change of three
degrees a century is probably faster than the global average temperature has changed at any time over the past ten thousand years. And as
there is a difference in global average temperature of only about ﬁve or
six degrees between the coldest part of an ice age and the warm periods
in between ice ages (see Figure 4.4), we can see that a few degrees in this
global average can represent a big change in climate. It is to this change
and especially to the very rapid rate of change that many ecosystems and
human communities (especially those in developing countries) will ﬁnd
it difﬁcult to adapt.
Not all the climate changes will in the end be adverse. While some
parts of the world experience more frequent or more severe droughts,
ﬂoods or signiﬁcant sea level rise, in other places crop yields may increase
due to the fertilising effect of carbon dioxide. Other places, perhaps
for instance in the sub-arctic, may become more habitable. Even there,
though, the likely rate of change will cause problems: large damage to
buildings will occur in regions of melting permafrost, and trees in subarctic forests like trees elsewhere will need time to adapt to new climatic
regimes.
Scientists are conﬁdent about the fact of global warming and climate
change due to human activities. However, substantial uncertainty remains
about just how large the warming will be and what will be the patterns
of change in different parts of the world. Although some indications can
be given, scientists cannot yet say in precise detail which regions will be
most affected. Intensive research is needed to improve the conﬁdence in
scientiﬁc predictions.

Adaptation and mitigation

Figure 1.5 where a complete cycle of cause and effect is shown. Begin

important) and aerosols. Moving in a clockwise direction around the
diagram, these emissions lead to changes in atmospheric concentrations
of important constituents that alter the energy input and output of the
climate system and hence cause changes in the climate. These climate
changes impact both humans and natural ecosystems altering patterns of
resource availability and affecting human livelihood and health. These
impacts in their turn affect human development in all its aspects. An
anticlockwise arrow represents other effects of development on human
communities and natural systems, for instance changes in land use that
lead to deforestation and loss of biodiversity.
Figure 1.5 also shows how both causes and effects can be changed
through adaptation and mitigation. In general adaptation is aimed at
reducing the effects and mitigation is aimed at reducing the causes of
climate change, in particular the emissions of the gases that give rise to it.

Global warming and climate change

Uncertainty and response
Predictions of the future climate are surrounded with considerable uncertainty that arises from our imperfect knowledge both of the science
of climate change and of the future scale of the human activities that
are its cause. Politicians and others making decisions are therefore faced
with the need to weigh all aspects of uncertainty against the desirability and the cost of the various actions that can be taken in response
to the threat of climate change. Some mitigating action can be taken
easily at relatively little cost (or even at a net saving of cost), for instance the development of programmes to conserve and save energy, and
many schemes for reducing deforestation and encouraging the planting
of trees. Other actions such as a large shift to energy sources that are
free from signiﬁcant carbon dioxide emissions (for example, renewable
sources – biomass, hydro, wind, or solar energy) both in the developed
and the developing countries of the world will take some time. Because
however of the long timescales that are involved in the development of
new energy infrastructure and in the response of the climate to emissions of gases like carbon dioxide, there is an urgency to begin these
actions now. As we shall argue later (Chapter 9), to ‘wait and see’ is an
irresponsible response.
In the following chapters I shall ﬁrst explain the science of global
warming, the evidence for it and the current state of the art regarding
climate prediction. I shall then go on to say what is known about the
likely impacts of climate change on human life – on water and food
supplies for instance. The questions of why we should be concerned for
the environment and what action should be taken in the face of scientiﬁc uncertainty are followed by consideration of the technical possibilities for large reductions in the emissions of carbon dioxide and how
these might affect our energy sources and usage, including means of
transport.
Finally I will address the issue of the ‘global village’. So far as the
environment is concerned, national boundaries are becoming less and
less important; pollution in one country can now affect the whole world.
Further, it is increasingly realised that problems of the environment are
linked to other global problems such as population growth, poverty, the
overuse of resources and global security. All these pose global challenges
that must be met by global solutions.

Chapter 2

The greenhouse effect

The basic principle of global warming can be understood by considering
the radiation energy from the Sun that warms the Earth’s surface and
the thermal radiation from the Earth and the atmosphere that is radiated
out to space. On average these two radiation streams must balance.
If the balance is disturbed (for instance by an increase in atmospheric
carbon dioxide) it can be restored by an increase in the Earth’s surface
temperature.

How the Earth keeps warm
To explain the processes that warm the Earth and its atmosphere, I will
begin with a very simpliﬁed Earth. Suppose we could, all of a sudden, remove from the atmosphere all the clouds, the water vapour, the
carbon dioxide and all the other minor gases and the dust, leaving an
atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen only. Everything else remains the
same. What, under these conditions, would happen to the atmospheric
temperature?
The calculation is an easy one, involving a relatively simple radiation
balance. Radiant energy from the Sun falls on a surface of one square
metre in area outside the atmosphere and directly facing the Sun at a rate
of about 1370 watts – about the power radiated by a reasonably sized
domestic electric ﬁre. However, few parts of the Earth’s surface face the
Sun directly and in any case for half the time they are pointing away from
the Sun at night, so that the average energy falling on one square metre
of a level surface outside the atmosphere is only one-quarter of this1 or
about 343 watts. As this radiation passes through the atmosphere a small

amount, about six per cent, is scattered back to space by atmospheric
molecules. About ten per cent on average is reﬂected back to space
from the land and ocean surface. The remaining eighty-four per cent, or
about 288 watts per square metre on average, remains actually to heat
the surface – the power used by three good-sized incandescent electric
light bulbs.
To balance this incoming energy, the Earth itself must radiate on
average the same amount of energy back to space (Figure 2.1) in the form
of thermal radiation. All objects emit this kind of radiation; if they are
hot enough we can see the radiation they emit. The Sun at a temperature
of about 6000 ◦ C looks white; an electric ﬁre at 800 ◦ C looks red. Cooler
objects emit radiation that cannot be seen by our eyes and which lies
at wavelengths beyond the red end of the spectrum – infrared radiation
(sometimes called long-wave radiation to distinguish it from the shortwave radiation from the Sun). On a clear, starry winter’s night we are
very aware of the cooling effect of this kind of radiation being emitted
by the Earth’s surface into space – it often leads to the formation of frost.
The amount of thermal radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface depends on its temperature – the warmer it is, the more radiation is emitted.
The amount of radiation also depends on how absorbing the surface is;
the greater the absorption, the more the radiation. Most of the surfaces
on the Earth, including ice and snow, would appear ‘black’ if we could
see them at infrared wavelengths; that means that they absorb nearly all
the thermal radiation which falls on them instead of reﬂecting it. It can
be calculated2 that, to balance the energy coming in, the average temperature of the Earth’s surface must be –6 ◦ C to radiate the right amount.3
This is much colder than is actually the case. In fact, an average of temperatures measured near the surface all over the Earth – over the oceans
as well as over the land – averaging, too, over the whole year, comes to
about 15 ◦ C. Some factor not yet taken into account is needed to explain
this discrepancy.

The greenhouse effect
The gases nitrogen and oxygen that make up the bulk of the atmosphere
(Table 2.1 gives details of the atmosphere’s composition) neither absorb nor emit thermal radiation. It is the water vapour, carbon dioxide
and some other minor gases present in the atmosphere in much smaller
quantities (Table 2.1) that absorb some of the thermal radiation leaving
the surface, acting as a partial blanket for this radiation and causing the
difference of 21 ◦ C or so between the actual average surface temperature
on the Earth of about 15 ◦ C and the ﬁgure of −6 ◦ C which applies when
the atmosphere contains nitrogen and oxygen only.4 This blanketing
is known as the natural greenhouse effect and the gases are known as
greenhouse gases. It is called ‘natural’ because all the atmospheric gases
(apart from the chloroﬂuorocarbons – CFCs) were there long before human beings came on the scene. Later on I will mention the enhanced
greenhouse effect: the added effect caused by the gases present in the atmosphere due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and
deforestation.
The basic science of the greenhouse effect has been known since
early in the nineteenth century (see box) when the similarity between the
radiative properties of the Earth’s atmosphere and of the glass in a greenhouse (Figure 2.2) was ﬁrst pointed out – hence the name ‘greenhouse
effect’. In a greenhouse, visible radiation from the Sun passes almost

The greenhouse effect

Pioneers of the science of the greenhouse effect5
The warming effect of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was ﬁrst
recognised in 1827 by the French scientist Jean-Baptiste Fourier, best
known for his contributions to mathematics. He also pointed out the
similarity between what happens in the atmosphere and in the glass
of a greenhouse, which led to the name ‘greenhouse effect’. The next
step was taken by a British scientist, John Tyndall, who, around 1860,
measured the absorption of infrared radiation by carbon dioxide and
water vapour; he also suggested that a cause of the Ice Ages might be
a decrease in the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide. It was a Swedish
chemist, Svante Arrhenius, in 1896, who calculated the effect of an
increasing concentration of greenhouse gases; he estimated that doubling
the concentration of carbon dioxide would increase the global average
temperature by 5 ◦ C to 6 ◦ C, an estimate not too far from our present
understanding.6 Nearly ﬁfty years later, around 1940, G. S. Callendar,
working in England, was the ﬁrst to calculate the warming due to the
increasing carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.
The ﬁrst expression of concern about the climate change which might
be brought about by increasing greenhouse gases was in 1957, when
Roger Revelle and Hans Suess of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography
in California published a paper which pointed out that in the build-up
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, human beings are carrying out a
large-scale geophysical experiment. In the same year, routine measurements of carbon dioxide were started from the observatory on Mauna
Kea in Hawaii. The rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels since then, together with growing interest in the environment, has led to the topic of
global warming moving up the political agenda through the 1980s, and
eventually to the Climate Convention signed in 1992 – of which more in
later chapters.

unimpeded through the glass and is absorbed by the plants and the soil
inside. The thermal radiation that is emitted by the plants and soil is,
however, absorbed by the glass that re-emits some of it back into the
greenhouse. The glass thus acts as a ‘radiation blanket’ helping to keep
the greenhouse warm.
However, the transfer of radiation is only one of the ways heat is
moved around in a greenhouse. A more important means of heat transfer is due to convection, in which less dense warm air moves upwards
and more dense cold air moves downwards. A familiar example of this
process is the use of convective electric heaters in the home, which heat
a room by stimulating convection in it. The situation in the greenhouse

17

18

The greenhouse effect

emitted thermal radiation.

is therefore more complicated than would be the case if radiation were
the only process of heat transfer.
Mixing and convection are also present in the atmosphere, although
on a much larger scale, and in order to achieve a proper understanding of the greenhouse effect, convective heat transfer processes in the
atmosphere must be taken into account as well as radiative ones.
Within the atmosphere itself (at least in the lowest three-quarters or
so of the atmosphere up to a height of about 10 km which is called the
troposphere) convection is, in fact, the dominant process for transferring
heat. It acts as follows. The surface of the Earth is warmed by the sunlight
it absorbs. Air close to the surface is heated and rises because of its lower
density. As the air rises it expands and cools – just as the air cools as it
comes out of the valve of a tyre. As some air masses rise, other air masses
descend, so the air is continually turning over as different movements
balance each other out – a situation of convective equilibrium. Temperature in the troposphere falls with height at a rate determined by these
convective processes; the fall with height (called the lapse-rate) turns
out on average to be about 6 ◦ C per kilometre of height (Figure 2.3).
A picture of the transfer of radiation in the atmosphere may be obtained by looking at the thermal radiation emitted by the Earth and its
atmosphere as observed from instruments on satellites orbiting the Earth
(Figure 2.4). At some wavelengths in the infrared the atmosphere – in
the absence of clouds – is largely transparent, just as it is in the visible
part of the spectrum. If our eyes were sensitive at these wavelengths we
would be able to peer through the atmosphere to the Sun, stars and Moon
above, just as we can in the visible spectrum. At these wavelengths all
the radiation originating from the Earth’s surface leaves the atmosphere.
At other wavelengths radiation from the surface is strongly absorbed
by some of the gases present in the atmosphere, in particular by water
vapour and carbon dioxide.

The greenhouse effect

Figure 2.3 The distribution of temperature in a convective atmosphere (full
line). The broken line shows how the temperature increases when the amount of
carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere is increased (in the diagram the
difference between the lines is exaggerated – for instance, for doubled carbon
dioxide in the absence of other effects the increase in temperature is about
1.2 ◦ C). Also shown for the two cases are the average levels from which thermal
radiation leaving the atmosphere originates (about 6 km for the unperturbed
atmosphere).

Figure 2.4 Thermal radiation in the infrared region (the visible part of the
spectrum is between about 0.4 and 0.7 µm) emitted from the Earth’s surface
and atmosphere as observed over the Mediterranean Sea from a satellite
instrument orbiting above the atmosphere, showing parts of the spectrum
where different gases contribute to the radiation. Between the wavelengths of
about 8 and 14 µm, apart from the ozone band, the atmosphere, in the absence
of clouds, is substantially transparent; this is part of the spectrum called a
’window’ region. Superimposed on the spectrum are curves of radiation from a
black body at 7 ◦ C, −13 ◦ C, −33 ◦ C and −53 ◦ C. The units of radiance are watts
per square metre per steradian per wavenumber.

The greenhouse effect

Figure 2.5 The blanketing
effect of greenhouse gases.

Objects that are good absorbers of radiation are also good emitters
of it. A black surface is both a good absorber and a good emitter, while
a highly reﬂecting surface absorbs rather little and emits rather little too
(which is why highly reﬂecting foil is used to cover the surface of a vacuum ﬂask and why it is placed above the insulation in the lofts of houses).
Absorbing gases in the atmosphere absorb some of the radiation
emitted by the Earth’s surface and in turn emit radiation out to space. The
amount of thermal radiation they emit is dependent on their temperature.
Radiation is emitted out to space by these gases from levels somewhere near the top of the atmosphere – typically from between 5 and
10 km high (see Figure 2.3). Here, because of the convection processes
mentioned earlier, the temperature is much colder – 30 to 50 ◦ C or so
colder – than at the surface. Because the gases are cold, they emit correspondingly less radiation. What these gases have to do, therefore, is
absorb some of the radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface but then to
emit much less radiation out to space. They, therefore, act as a radiation blanket over the surface (note that the outer surface of a blanket is
colder than inside the blanket) and help to keep it warmer than it would
otherwise be7 (Figure 2.5).
There needs to be a balance between the radiation coming in and
the radiation leaving the top of the atmosphere – as there was in the
very simple model with which this chapter started. Figure 2.6 shows
the various components of the radiation entering and leaving the top of
the atmosphere for the real atmosphere situation. On average, 240 watts
per square metre of solar radiation are absorbed by the atmosphere and
the surface; this is less than the 288 watts mentioned at the beginning of
the chapter, because now the effect of clouds is being taken into account.
Clouds reﬂect some of the incident radiation from the Sun back out to
space. However, they also absorb and emit thermal radiation and have
a blanketing effect similar to that of the greenhouse gases. These two
effects work in opposite senses: one (the reﬂection of solar radiation)
tends to cool the Earth’s surface and the other (the absorption of thermal
radiation) tends to warm it. Careful consideration of these two effects
shows that on average the net effect of clouds on the total budget of
radiation results in a slight cooling of the Earth’s surface.8

Mars and Venus

The numbers in Figure 2.6 demonstrate the required balance – 240
watts per square metre on average coming in and 240 watts per square
metre on average going out. The temperature of the surface and hence of
the atmosphere above adjusts itself to ensure that this balance is maintained. It is interesting to note that the greenhouse effect can only operate
if there are colder temperatures in the higher atmosphere. Without the
structure of decreasing temperature with height, therefore, there would
be no greenhouse effect on the Earth.

Mars and Venus
Similar greenhouse effects also occur on our nearest planetary neighbours, Mars and Venus. Mars is smaller than the Earth and possesses, by
Earth’s standards, a very thin atmosphere. A barometer on the surface of
Mars would record an atmospheric pressure less than one per cent of that
on the Earth. Its atmosphere, which consists almost entirely of carbon
dioxide, contributes a small but signiﬁcant greenhouse effect.
The planet Venus, which can often be seen fairly close to the Sun
in the morning or evening sky, has a very different atmosphere to Mars.
Venus is about the same size as the Earth. A barometer for use on Venus
would need to survive very hostile conditions and would need to be able to
measure a pressure about one hundred times as great as that on the Earth.
Within the Venus atmosphere, which consists very largely of carbon
dioxide, deep clouds consisting of droplets of almost pure sulphuric
acid completely cover the planet and prevent most of the sunlight from
reaching the surface. Some Russian space probes that have landed there
have recorded what would be dusk-like conditions on the Earth – only one

on average enter and leave
the Earth’s atmosphere and

budget for the

22

The greenhouse effect

or two per cent of the sunlight present above the clouds penetrates that
far. One might suppose, because of the small amount of solar energy
available to keep the surface warm, that it would be rather cool; on
the contrary, measurements from the same Russian space probes ﬁnd a
temperature there of about 525 ◦ C – a dull red heat, in fact.
The reason for this very high temperature is the greenhouse effect.
Because of the very thick absorbing atmosphere of carbon dioxide, little
of the thermal radiation from the surface can get out. The atmosphere
acts as such an effective radiation blanket that, although there is not
much solar energy to warm the surface, the greenhouse effect amounts
to nearly 500 ◦ C.

The ‘runaway’ greenhouse effect
What occurs on Venus is an example of what has been called the ‘runaway’ greenhouse effect. It can be explained by imagining the early
history of the Venus atmosphere, which was formed by the release of
gases from the interior of the planet. To start with it would contain a lot of
water vapour, a powerful greenhouse gas (Figure 2.7). The greenhouse
effect of the water vapour would cause the temperature at the surface to
rise. The increased temperature would lead to more evaporation of water
from the surface, giving more atmospheric water vapour, a larger greenhouse effect and therefore a further increased surface temperature. The
process would continue until either the atmosphere became saturated
with water vapour or all the available water had evaporated.

Figure 2.7 Illustrating the evolution of the atmospheres of the Earth, Mars and
Venus. In this diagram, the surface temperatures of the three planets are plotted
against the vapour pressure of water in their atmospheres as they evolved. Also
on the diagram (dashed) are the phase lines for water, dividing the diagram into
regions where vapour, liquid water or ice are in equilibrium. For Mars and the
Earth the greenhouse effect is halted when water vapour is in equilibrium with
ice or liquid water. For Venus no such halting occurs and the diagram illustrates
the ’runaway’ greenhouse effect.

The enhanced greenhouse effect

A runaway sequence something like this seems to have occurred on
Venus. Why, we may ask, has it not happened on the Earth, a planet of
about the same size as Venus and, so far as is known, of a similar initial
chemical composition? The reason is that Venus is closer to the Sun than
the Earth; the amount of solar energy per square metre falling on Venus
is about twice that falling on the Earth. The surface of Venus, when there
was no atmosphere, would have started off at a temperature of just over
50 ◦ C (Figure 2.7). Throughout the sequence described above for Venus,
water on the surface would have been continuously boiling. Because of
the high temperature, the atmosphere would never have become saturated
with water vapour. The Earth, however, would have started at a colder
temperature; at each stage of the sequence it would have arrived at an
equilibrium between the surface and an atmosphere saturated with water
vapour. There is no possibility of such runaway greenhouse conditions
occurring on the Earth.

The enhanced greenhouse effect
After our excursion to Mars and Venus, let us return to Earth! The natural
greenhouse effect is due to the gases water vapour and carbon dioxide
present in the atmosphere in their natural abundances as now on Earth.
The amount of water vapour in our atmosphere depends mostly on the
temperature of the surface of the oceans; most of it originates through
evaporation from the ocean surface and is not inﬂuenced directly by
human activity. Carbon dioxide is different. Its amount has changed
substantially – by about thirty per cent so far – since the Industrial
Revolution, due to human industry and also because of the removal of
forests (see Chapter 3). Future projections are that, in the absence of
controlling factors, the rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide
will accelerate and that its atmospheric concentration will double from
its pre-industrial value within the next hundred years (Figure 6.2).
This increased amount of carbon dioxide is leading to global warming of the Earth’s surface because of its enhanced greenhouse effect.
Let us imagine, for instance, that the amount of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere suddenly doubled, everything else remaining the same
(Figure 2.8). What would happen to the numbers in the radiation budget
presented earlier (Figure 2.6)? The solar radiation budget would not be
affected. The greater amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means
that the thermal radiation emitted from it will originate on average from
a higher and colder level than before (Figure 2.3). The thermal radiation
budget will therefore be reduced, the amount of reduction being about
4 watts per square metre (a more precise value is 3.7).9

23

24

The greenhouse effect

Figure 2.8 Illustrating the enhanced greenhouse gas effect. Under natural
conditions (a) the net solar radiation coming in (S = 240 watts per square
metre) is balanced by thermal radiation (L) leaving the top of the atmosphere;
average surface temperature (Ts ) is 15 ◦ C. If the carbon dioxide concentration is
suddenly doubled (b), L is decreased by 4 watts per square metre. Balance is
restored if nothing else changes (c) apart from the temperature of the surface
and lower atmosphere, which rises by 1.2 ◦ C. If feedbacks are also taken into
account (d), the average temperature of the surface rises by about 2.5 ◦ C.

This causes a net imbalance in the overall budget of 4 watts per square
metre. More energy is coming in than going out. To restore the balance
the surface and lower atmosphere will warm up. If nothing changes apart
from the temperature – in other words, the clouds, the water vapour, the
ice and snow cover and so on are all the same as before – the temperature
change turns out to be about 1.2 ◦ C.
In reality, of course, many of these other factors will change, some
of them in ways that add to the warming (these are called positive
feedbacks), others in ways that might reduce the warming (negative
feedbacks). The situation is therefore much more complicated than this
simple calculation. These complications will be considered in more detail in Chapter 5. Sufﬁce it to say here that the best estimate at the present
time of the increased average temperature of the Earth’s surface if carbon dioxide levels were to be doubled is about twice that of the simple
calculation: 2.5 ◦ C. As the last chapter explained, for the global average
temperature this is a large change. It is this global warming expected to
result from the enhanced greenhouse effect that is the cause of current
concern.
Having dealt with a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide, it
is interesting to ask what would happen if all the carbon dioxide were
removed from the atmosphere. It is sometimes supposed that the outgoing
radiation would be changed by 4 watts per square metre in the other
direction and that the Earth would then cool by one or two degrees
Celsius. In fact, that would happen if the carbon dioxide amount were

Questions

to be halved. If it were to be removed altogether, the change in outgoing
radiation would be around 25 watts per square metre – six times as big –
and the temperature change would be similarly increased. The reason
for this is that with the amount of carbon dioxide currently present in
the atmosphere there is maximum carbon dioxide absorption over much
of the region of the spectrum where it absorbs (Figure 2.4), so that a
big change in gas concentration leads to a relatively small change in
the amount of radiation it absorbs.10 This is like the situation in a pool
of water: when it is clear, a small amount of mud will make it appear
muddy, but when it is muddy, adding more mud only makes a small
difference.
An obvious question to ask is: has evidence of the enhanced greenhouse effect been seen in the recent climatic record? Chapter 4 will look
at the record of temperature on the Earth during the last century or so,
during which the Earth has warmed on average by rather more than half
a degree Celsius. We shall see in Chapters 4 and 5 that there are good
reasons for attributing most of this warming to the enhanced greenhouse
effect, although because of the size of natural climate variability the
exact amount of that attribution remains subject to some uncertainty.
To summarise the argument so far:
r No one doubts the reality of the natural greenhouse effect, which keeps
us over 20 ◦ C warmer than we would otherwise be. The science of it
is well understood; it is similar science that applies to the enhanced
greenhouse effect.
r Substantial greenhouse effects occur on our nearest planetary neighbours, Mars and Venus. Given the conditions that exist on those planets,
the sizes of their greenhouse effects can be calculated, and good agreement has been found with those measurements which are available.
r Study of climates of the past gives some clues about the greenhouse
effect, as Chapter 4 will show.
First, however, the greenhouse gases themselves must be considered.
How does carbon dioxide get into the atmosphere, and what other gases
affect global warming?

Carry out the calculation described in Note 4 (refer also to Note 2) which
obtains an equilibrium average temperature of −18 ◦ C for an Earth partially
covered with clouds such that thirty per cent of the incoming solar radiation
is reﬂected. If clouds are assumed to cover half the Earth and if the reﬂectivity
of the clouds increases by one per cent what change will this make in the
resulting equilibrium average temperature?

It is sometimes argued that the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide is negligible because its absorption band in the infrared is so close to saturation
that there is very little additional absorption of radiation emitted from the
surface. What are the fallacies in this argument?
Use the information in Figure 2.4 to estimate approximately the surface
temperature that would result if carbon dioxide were completely removed
from the atmosphere. What is required is that the total energy radiated by
the Earth plus atmosphere should remain the same, i.e. the area under the
radiance curve in Figure 2.4 should be unaltered. On this basis construct a
new curve with the carbon dioxide band absent.11
Using information from books or articles on climatology or meteorology
describe why the presence of water vapour in the atmosphere is of such
importance in determining the atmosphere’s circulation.
Estimates of regional warming due to increased greenhouse gases are generally larger over land areas than over ocean areas. What might be the reasons
for this?
(For students with a background in physics) What is meant by Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE),12 a basic assumption underlying calculations
of radiative transfer in the lower atmosphere appropriate to discussions of
the greenhouse effect? Under what conditions does LTE apply?

Notes for Chapter 2
1 It is about one-quarter because the area of the Earth’s surface is four times
the area of the disc, which is the projection of the Earth facing the Sun; see
Figure 2.1.
2 The radiation by a black body is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant (5.67 ×
10−8 J m−2 K−4 s−1 ) multiplied by the fourth power of the body’s absolute temperature in Kelvin. The absolute temperature is the temperature in
degrees Celsius plus 273 (1 K = 1 ◦ C).
3 These calculations using a simple model of an atmosphere containing nitrogen and oxygen only have been carried out to illustrate the effect of the
other gases, especially water vapour and carbon dioxide. It is not, of course,
a model that can exist in reality. All the water vapour could not be removed
from the atmosphere above a water or ice surface. Further, with an average
surface temperature of −6 ◦ C, in a real situation the surface would have
much more ice cover. The additional ice would reﬂect more solar energy out
to space leading to a further lowering of the surface temperature.
4 The above calculation is often carried out using a ﬁgure of thirty per cent
for the average reﬂectivity of the Earth and atmosphere, rather than the
sixteen per cent assumed here; the calculation of surface temperature then
gives −18 ◦ C for the average surface temperature rather than the −6 ◦ C
found here. The higher ﬁgure of thirty per cent for the Earth’s average
reﬂectivity is applicable when clouds are also included, in which case the
average temperature of −18 ◦ C is not applicable to the Earth’s surface but
to some appropriate level in the atmosphere. Further, clouds not only reﬂect

solar radiation but also absorb thermal radiation, and so have a blanketing
effect similar to greenhouse gases. For the purposes of illustrating the effect
of greenhouse gases, therefore, it is more correct to omit the effect of clouds
from this initial calculation.

Chapter 3

The greenhouse gases

The greenhouse gases are those gases in the atmosphere which, by
absorbing thermal radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface, have a blanketing effect upon it. The most important of the greenhouse gases is
water vapour, but its amount in the atmosphere is not changing directly
because of human activities. The important greenhouse gases that are
directly inﬂuenced by human activities are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, the chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs) and ozone. This chapter will
describe what is known about the origin of these gases, how their concentration in the atmosphere is changing and how it is controlled. Also
considered will be particles in the atmosphere of anthropogenic origin
that can act to cool the surface.

Which are the most important greenhouse gases?
Figure 2.4 illustrated the regions of the infrared spectrum where the
greenhouse gases absorb. Their importance as greenhouse gases depends
both on their concentration in the atmosphere (Table 2.1) and on the
strength of their absorption of infrared radiation. Both these quantities
differ greatly for various gases.
Carbon dioxide is the most important of the greenhouse gases that
are increasing in atmospheric concentration because of human activities.
If, for the moment, we ignore the effects of the CFCs and of changes
in ozone, which vary considerably over the globe and which are therefore more difﬁcult to quantify, the increase in carbon dioxide (CO2 ) has
contributed about seventy per cent of the enhanced greenhouse effect

28

Carbon dioxide and the carbon cycle

to date, methane (CH4 ) about twenty-four per cent, and nitrous oxide
(N2 O) about six per cent (Figure 3.8).

Radiative forcing
In this chapter we shall use the concept of radiative forcing to compare
the relative greenhouse effects of different atmospheric constituents. It
is necessary therefore at the start to deﬁne radiative forcing.
In Chapter 2 we noted that, if the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
were suddenly doubled, everything else remaining the same, a net radiation imbalance near the top of the atmosphere of 3.7 W m−2 would result.
This radiation imbalance is an example of radiation forcing, which is deﬁned as the change in average net radiation at the top of the troposphere1
(the lower atmosphere; for deﬁnition see Glossary) which occurs because of a change in the concentration of a greenhouse gas or because of
some other change in the overall climate system; for instance, a change
in the incoming solar radiation would constitute a radiative forcing. As
we saw in the discussion in Chapter 2, over time the climate responds to
restore the radiative balance between incoming and outgoing radiation.
A positive radiative forcing tends on average to warm the surface and a
negative radiative forcing tends on average to cool the surface.

Carbon dioxide and the carbon cycle
Carbon dioxide provides the dominant means through which carbon is
transferred in nature between a number of natural carbon reservoirs – a
process known as the carbon cycle. We contribute to this cycle every time
we breathe. Using the oxygen we take in from the atmosphere, carbon
from our food is burnt and turned into carbon dioxide that we then exhale;
in this way we are provided with the energy we need to maintain our life.
Animals contribute to atmospheric carbon dioxide in the same way; so
do ﬁres, rotting wood and decomposition of organic material in the soil
and elsewhere. To offset these processes of respiration whereby carbon is
turned into carbon dioxide, there are processes involving photosynthesis
in plants and trees which work the opposite way; in the presence of
light, they take in carbon dioxide, use the carbon for growth and return
the oxygen back to the atmosphere. Both respiration and photosynthesis
also occur in the ocean.
Figure 3.1 is a simple diagram of the way carbon cycles between
the various reservoirs – the atmosphere, the oceans (including the ocean
biota), the soil and the land biota (biota is a word that covers all living
things – plants, trees, animals and so on – on land and in the ocean, which

make up a whole known as the biosphere). The diagram shows that the
movements of carbon (in the form of carbon dioxide) into and out of
the atmosphere are quite large; about one-ﬁfth of the total amount in the
atmosphere is cycled in and out each year, part with the land biota and
part through physical and chemical processes across the ocean surface.
The land and ocean reservoirs are much larger than the amount in the
atmosphere; small changes in these larger reservoirs could therefore have
a large effect on the atmospheric concentration; the release of just two
per cent of the carbon stored in the oceans would double the amount of
atmospheric carbon dioxide.
It is important to realise that on the timescales with which we are
concerned anthropogenic carbon emitted into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide is not destroyed but redistributed among the various carbon
reservoirs. Carbon dioxide is therefore different from other greenhouse
gases that are destroyed by chemical action in the atmosphere. The carbon reservoirs exchange carbon between themselves on a wide range of

Carbon dioxide and the carbon cycle

timescales determined by their respective turnover times – which range
from less than a year to decades (for exchange with the top layers of
the ocean and the land biosphere) to millennia (for exchange with the
deep ocean or long-lived soil pools). These timescales are generally
much longer than the average time a particular carbon dioxide molecule
spends in the atmosphere, which is only about four years. The large range
of turnover times means that the time taken for a perturbation in the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration to relax back to an equilibrium
cannot be described by a single time constant. Although a lifetime of
about a hundred years is often quoted for atmospheric carbon dioxide so
as to provide some guide, use of a single lifetime can be very misleading.
Before human activities became a signiﬁcant disturbance, and over
periods short compared with geological timescales, the exchanges between the reservoirs were remarkably constant. For several thousand
years before the beginning of industrialisation around 1750, a steady
balance was maintained, such that the mixing ratio (or mole fraction, for
deﬁnition see Glossary) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as measured
from ice cores (see Chapter 4) kept within about ten parts per million of
a mean value of about 280 parts per million (ppm) – see Figure 3.2(a).
The Industrial Revolution disturbed this balance and since its beginning in about 1700 approximately 600 thousand million tonnes (or
gigatonnes, Gt) of carbon have been emitted into the atmosphere from
fossil fuel burning. This has resulted in a concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that has increased by about thirty per cent, from
280 ppm around 1700 to a value of over 370 ppm at the present day
(Figure 3.2(b)). Accurate measurements, which have been made since
1959 from an observatory near the summit of Mauna Loa in Hawaii,
show that carbon dioxide is currently increasing on average each year
by about 1.5 ppm, although there are large variations from year to year
(Figure 3.2(c)). This increase spread through the atmosphere adds about
3.3 Gt to the atmospheric carbon reservoir each year.
It is easy to establish how much coal, oil and gas is being burnt worldwide each year. Most of it is to provide energy for human needs: for heating and domestic appliances, for industry and for transport (considered
in detail in Chapter 11). The burning of these fossil fuels has increased
rapidly since the Industrial Revolution (Figure 3.3 and Table 3.1); currently the annual total is between 6 and 7 Gt of carbon, nearly all of
which enters the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Another contribution to
atmospheric carbon dioxide due to human activities comes from landuse change, in particular from the burning and decay of forests balanced
in part by aforestation or forest regrowth. This contribution is not easy
to quantify but some estimates are given in Figure 3.3 and Table 3.1.

fossil fuel burning, cement manufacture and land-use change amounted
to about 7.1 Gt; over three-quarters of these resulted from fossil fuel
burning. Since the annual net increase in the atmosphere was about
3.3 Gt, about forty-ﬁve per cent of the 7.1 Gt of new carbon remained to
increase the atmospheric concentration. The other ﬁfty-ﬁve per cent was
taken up between the other two reservoirs: the oceans and the land biota.

The greenhouse gases

Figure 3.5 shows that these fractions may change substantially in the
future.
About ninety-ﬁve per cent of fossil fuel burning occurs in the
northern hemisphere, so there is more carbon dioxide there than in the
southern hemisphere. The difference is currently about two parts per
million and, over the years, has grown in parallel with fossil fuel emissions, thus adding further compelling evidence that the atmospheric
increase in carbon dioxide levels results from these emissions.
We turn now to what happens in the oceans. We know that carbon
dioxide dissolves in water; carbonated drinks make use of that fact. Carbon dioxide is continually being exchanged with the air above the ocean
across the whole ocean surface (about 90 Gt per year is so exchanged –
Figure 3.1), particularly as waves break. An equilibrium is established
between the concentration of carbon dioxide dissolved in the surface
waters and the concentration in the air above the surface. The chemical
laws governing this equilibrium are such that if the atmospheric concentration changes by ten per cent the concentration in solution in the water
changes by only one-tenth of this: one per cent.
This change will occur quite rapidly in the upper waters of the ocean,
the top hundred metres or so, so enabling part of the anthropogenic (i.e.
human generated) carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere (most of the
ocean’s share of the ﬁfty-ﬁve per cent mentioned above) to be taken up
quite rapidly. Absorption in the lower levels in the ocean takes longer;
mixing of surface water with water at lower levels takes up to several
hundred years or for the deep ocean over a thousand years. This process
whereby carbon dioxide is gradually drawn from the atmosphere in the
ocean’s lower levels is sometimes known as the solubility pump.
So the oceans do not provide as immediate a sink for increased
atmospheric carbon dioxide as might be suggested by the size of the
exchanges with the large ocean reservoir. For short-term changes only
the surface layers of water play a large part in the carbon cycle.
Biological activity in the oceans also plays an important role. It may
not be immediately apparent, but the oceans are literally teeming with
life. Although the total mass of living matter within the oceans is not
large, it has a high rate of turnover. Living material in the oceans is
produced at some thirty to forty per cent of the rate of production on
land. Most of this production is of plant and animal plankton that go
through a rapid series of life cycles. As they die and decay some of the
carbon they contain is carried downwards into lower levels of the ocean
adding to the carbon content of those levels. Some is carried to the very
deep water or to the ocean bottom where, so far as the carbon cycle is
concerned, it is out of circulation for hundreds or thousands of years.

Carbon dioxide and the carbon cycle

35

The biological pump in the oceans3
In temperate and high latitudes there is a peak each
spring in ocean biological activity. During the winter, water rich in nutrients is transferred from deep
water to levels near the surface. As sunlight increases in the spring an explosive growth of the
plankton population occurs, known as the ‘spring
bloom’. Pictures of the colour of the ocean taken
from satellites orbiting the Earth can demonstrate
dramatically where this is happening.
Plankton are small plants (phytoplankton) and
animals (zooplankton) that live in the surface waters of the ocean; they range in size between about
one-thousandth of a millimetre across and the size
of typical insects on land. Herbivorous zooplankton graze on phytoplankton; carnivorous zooplankton eat herbivorous zooplankton. Plant and animal debris from these living systems sinks in
the ocean. While sinking, some decomposes and
returns to the water as nutrients, some (perhaps
about one per cent) reaches the deep ocean or
the ocean ﬂoor, where it is lost to the carbon cycle for hundreds, thousands or even millions of
years. The net effect of the ‘biological pump’ is
to move carbon from the surface waters to lower
levels in the ocean. As the amount of carbon in
the surface waters is reduced, more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere can be drawn down in order to restore the surface equilibrium. It is thought
that the ‘biological pump’ has remained substantially constant in its operation during the last century unaffected by the increase in carbon dioxide
availability.
Evidence of the importance of the ‘biological
pump’ comes from the paleoclimate record from
ice cores (see Chapter 4). One of the constituents
from the atmosphere trapped in bubbles in the ice
is the gas methyl sulphonic acid, which originates
from decaying ocean plankton; its concentration is
therefore an indicator of plankton activity. As the

global temperature began to increase when the last
Ice Age receded nearly 20 000 years ago and as the
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere began to increase
(Figure 4.4), the methyl sulphonic acid concentration decreased. An interesting link is thereby
provided between the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and marine biological activity. During the
cold periods of the Ice Ages, enhanced biological
activity in the ocean could have been responsible
for maintaining the atmospheric carbon dioxide
at a lower level of concentration – the ‘biological
pump’ was having an effect.
There is some evidence from the paleo record
of the biological activity in the ocean being stimulated by the presence of iron-containing dust blown
over the oceans from the land surface. This has led
to some proposals in recent years to enhance the
‘biological pump’ through artiﬁcially introducing
iron over suitable parts of the ocean. While an interesting idea, it seems from careful studies that
even a very large-scale operation would not have a
large practical effect.
The question then remains as to why the Ice
Ages should be periods of greater marine biological activity than the warm periods in between. A
British oceanographer, Professor John Woods, has
suggested that the key may lie in what happens in
the winter as nutrients are fed into the upper ocean
ready for the spring bloom. When there is less atmospheric carbon dioxide, the cooling by radiation
from the surface of the ocean increases. Since convection in the upper layers of the ocean is driven
by cooling at the surface, the increased cooling
results in a greater depth of the mixed layer near
the top of the ocean where all the biological activity occurs. This is an example of a positive biological feedback; a greater depth of layer means
more plankton growth. Woods calls it the ‘plankton
multiplier’.4

36

The greenhouse gases

This process, whose contribution to the carbon cycle is known as the
biological pump (see box), was important in determining the changes
of carbon dioxide concentration in both the atmosphere and the ocean
during the ice ages (see Chapter 4).
Computer models – which calculate solutions for the mathematical equations describing a given physical situation, in order to predict
its behaviour (see Chapter 5) – have been set up to describe in detail
the exchanges of carbon between the atmosphere and different parts of
the ocean. To test the validity of these models, they have also been applied to the dispersal in the ocean of the carbon isotope 14 C that entered
the ocean after the nuclear tests of the 1950s; the models simulate this
dispersal quite well. From the model results, it is estimated that about
2 Gt (±0.8 Gt) of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere each year
ends up in the oceans (Table 3.1 and Figure 3.3). Observations of the
relative distribution of the other isotopes of carbon in the atmosphere
and in the oceans also conﬁrm this estimate (see Box below).
Further information regarding the broad partitioning of added
atmospheric carbon dioxide between the atmosphere, the oceans and
the land biota as presented in Table 3.1 comes from comparing the
trends in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration with the trends in
very accurate measurements of the atmospheric oxygen/nitrogen ratio.5
This possibility arises because the relation between the exchanges of
carbon dioxide and oxygen with the atmosphere over land is different to
that over the ocean. On land, living organisms through photosynthesis
take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and build up carbohydrates,
returning the oxygen to the atmosphere. In the process of respiration
they also take in oxygen from the atmosphere and convert it to
carbon dioxide. In the ocean, by contrast, carbon dioxide taken from
the atmosphere is dissolved, both the carbon and the oxygen in the
molecules being removed. How such measurements can be interpreted
for the period 1990–4 is shown in Figure 3.4. These data are consistent
with budget for the 1990s shown in Table 3.1.
The global land–atmosphere ﬂux in Table 3.1 represents the balance
of a net ﬂux due to land-use changes which has generally been positive or a source of carbon to the atmosphere (Figure 3.3) and a residual
component that is, by inference, a negative ﬂux or carbon sink. The estimates of land-use changes (Table 3.1) are dominated by deforestation in
tropical regions although some uptake of carbon has occurred through
forest regrowth in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and
other changes in land management. The main processes that contribute
to the residual carbon sink are believed to be the carbon dioxide ‘fertilisation’ effect (increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere leads to
increased growth in some plants – see box in Chapter 7 on page 166),

Carbon dioxide and the carbon cycle

What we can learn from carbon isotopes
Isotopes are chemically identical forms of the same element but with different atomic weights. Three isotopes of carbon are important in studies
of the carbon cycle: the most abundant isotope 12 C which makes up
98.9 per cent of ordinary carbon, 13 C present at about 1.1 per cent and
the radioactive isotope 14 C which is present only in very small quantities.
About 10 kg of 14 C is produced in the atmosphere each year by the action
of particle radiation from the Sun; half of this will decay into nitrogen
over a period of 5730 years (the ‘half-life’ of 14 C).
When carbon in carbon dioxide is taken up by plants and other
living things, less 13 C is taken up in proportion than 12 C. Fossil fuel
such as coal and oil was originally living matter so also contains less
13
C (by about eighteen parts per thousand) than the carbon dioxide in
ordinary air in the atmosphere today. Adding carbon to the atmosphere
from burning forests, decaying vegetation or fossil fuel will therefore
tend to reduce the proportion of 13 C.
Because fossil fuel has been stored in the Earth for much longer
than 5730 years (the half-life of 14 C), it contains no 14 C at all. Therefore,
carbon from fossil fuel added to the atmosphere reduces the proportion
of 14 C the atmosphere contains.
By studying the ratio of the different isotopes of carbon in the atmosphere, in the oceans, in gas trapped in ice cores and in tree rings, it
is possible to ﬁnd out where the additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has come from and also what amount has been transferred to the
ocean. For instance, it has been possible to estimate for different times
how much carbon dioxide has entered the atmosphere from the burning
or decay of forests and other vegetation and how much from fossil fuels.
Similar isotopic measurements on the carbon in atmospheric
methane provide information about how much methane from fossil fuel
sources has entered the atmosphere at different times.

the effects of increased use of nitrogen fertilisers and of some changes in
climate. The magnitudes of these contributions (Table 3.1 and Figure 3.3)
are difﬁcult to estimate directly and are subject to much more uncertainty
than their total, which can be inferred from the requirement to balance
the overall carbon cycle budget.
A clue to the uptake of carbon by the land biosphere is provided from
observations of the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide which,
each year, show a regular cycle; the seasonal variation, for instance, at
the observatory site at Mauna Loa in Hawaii approaches about 10 ppm.
Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere during the growing season and is returned as the vegetation dies away in the winter. Since there

Future emissions of carbon dioxide

is more vegetation growth in the northern hemisphere than the southern, a minimum in the annual cycle of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
occurs in the northern summer. Estimates from carbon cycle models of
the uptake by the land biosphere are constrained by these observations
of the difference between the hemispheres.6
The carbon dioxide fertilisation effect is an example of a biological
feedback process. It is a negative feedback because, as carbon dioxide
increases, it tends to increase the take-up of carbon dioxide by plants
and therefore reduce the amount in the atmosphere, decreasing the rate
of global warming. Positive feedback processes, which would tend to
accelerate the rate of global warming, also exist; in fact there are more
potentially positive processes than negative ones (see box on page 40).
Although scientiﬁc knowledge cannot yet put precise ﬁgures on them,
there are strong indications that some of the positive feedbacks could
be large, especially if carbon dioxide were to continue to increase, with
its associated global warming, through the twenty-ﬁrst century into the
twenty-second. Carbon dioxide provides the largest single contribution to
anthropogenic radiative forcing. Its radiative forcing from pre-industrial
times to the present is shown in Figure 3.8. A useful formula for the
radiative forcing R from atmospheric carbon dioxide when its atmospheric concentration is C ppm is: R = 5.3 ln (C/C0 ) where C0 is its
pre-industrial concentration of 280 ppm.

Future emissions of carbon dioxide
To obtain information about future climate we need to estimate the future
atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, which depend on future
anthropogenic emissions. In these estimates, the long time constants
associated with the response of atmospheric carbon dioxide to change
have important implications. Suppose, for instance, that all emissions
into the atmosphere from human activities were suddenly halted. No
sudden change would occur in the atmospheric concentration, which
would decline only slowly. We could not expect it to approach its preindustrial value for several hundred years.
But emissions of carbon dioxide are not halting, nor are they slowing;
their increase is, in fact, becoming larger each year. The atmospheric
concentration of carbon dioxide will therefore also increase more rapidly.
Later chapters (especially Chapter 6) will present estimates of climate
change during the twenty-ﬁrst century due to the increase in greenhouse
gases. A prerequisite for such estimates is the knowledge of what changes
in carbon dioxide emissions there are likely to be. Estimating what will
happen in the future is, of course, not easy. Because nearly everything
we do has an inﬂuence on the emissions of carbon dioxide, it means

39

40

The greenhouse gases

Feedbacks in the biosphere
As the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane are added to the
atmosphere because of human activities, biological or other feedback
processes occurring in the biosphere (such as those that arise from the
climate change that has been induced) inﬂuence the rate of increase
of the atmospheric concentration of these gases. These processes will
either tend to add to the anthropogenic increase (positive feedbacks) or
to subtract from it (negative feedbacks).
Two feedbacks, one positive (the plankton multiplier in the ocean)
and one negative (carbon dioxide fertilisation), have already been mentioned in the text. Three other positive feedbacks are potentially important, although our knowledge is currently insufﬁcient to quantify them
precisely.
One is the effect of higher temperatures on respiration, especially
through microbes in soils, leading to increased carbon dioxide emissions.
Evidence regarding the magnitude of this effect has come from studies
of the short-term variations of atmospheric carbon dioxide that have
occurred during El Ni˜no events and during the cooler period following
the Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991. These studies, which covered
variations over a few years, indicate a relation such that a change of
5 ◦ C in average temperature leads to a forty per cent change in global
average respiration rate7 – a substantial effect. A question that needs to
be resolved is whether this relation still holds over longer-term changes
of the order of several decades to a century.
A second positive feedback is the reduction of growth or the dieback especially in forests because of the stress caused by climate change,
which may be particularly severe in Amazonia8 (see box in Chapter 7
on page 173). As with the last effect, this will increase as the amount of
climate change becomes larger. A number of carbon cycle models show
that, through these two effects, during the second half of the twenty-ﬁrst
century the residual terrestrial sink (Table 3.1) could change sign and
become a substantial net source (Figure 3.5).
The third positive feedback is the release of methane, as temperatures increase – from wetlands and from very large reservoirs of methane
trapped in sediments in a hydrate form (tied to water molecules when
under pressure) – mostly at high latitudes. Methane has been generated
from the decomposition of organic matter present in these sediments
over many millions of years. Because of the depth of the sediments this
latter feedback is unlikely to become operative to a signiﬁcant extent
during the twenty-ﬁrst century. However, were global warming to continue to increase substantially for more than a hundred years, releases
from hydrates could make a large contribution to methane emissions into
the atmosphere and act as a large positive feedback on the climate.

Figure 3.5 Illustrating the possible effects of climate feedbacks on the carbon
cycle. Results are shown of the changing budgets of carbon (in gigatonnes of
carbon) in the atmosphere, land and ocean in an ocean–atmosphere model
coupled to an ocean carbon cycle model (which includes the transfer of carbon
dioxide to depth through both the solubility pump and the biological pump)
and a dynamic global vegetation model (which includes the exchange of carbon
with the soil and with ﬁve different types of plant). The model was run with the
fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions from 1860 to the present and then projected
to 2100 assuming the IS 92a scenario shown in Figure 6.1. Note that because of
climate feedbacks, the terrestrial biosphere changes from being a net sink of
carbon to being a net source around the middle of the twenty-ﬁrst century. Note
also as this source becomes stronger, by 2100 the atmospheric carbon content is
increasing at about the same rate as the total emissions (i.e. the ‘airborne
fraction’, or the fraction of fossil fuel emissions that remains in the atmosphere,
has changed from being about a half in the year 2000 to being about unity in
2100). Note also that an atmospheric carbon content of 1500 Gt more than it
was in 1860 is equivalent to a concentration of nearly 1000 ppm.

estimating how human beings will behave and what their activities are
likely to be. For instance, assumptions need to be made about population
growth, economic growth, energy use, the development of energy sources
and the likely inﬂuence of pressures to preserve the environment. These
assumptions are required for all countries of the world, both developing
as well as developed ones. Further, since any assumptions made are

41

42

The greenhouse gases

unlikely to be fulﬁlled accurately in practice, it is necessary to make a
variety of different assumptions, so that we can get some idea of the
range of possibilities. Such possible futures are called scenarios.
In Chapter 6 are presented two sets of emission scenarios as developed respectively by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) and the World Energy Council (WEC). These emission scenarios are then turned into future projections of atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentrations through the application of a computer model of the carbon
cycle that includes descriptions of all the exchanges already mentioned.
Further in that chapter, through the application of computer models of
the climate (see Chapter 5), projections of the resulting climate change
from different scenarios are also presented.

Other greenhouse gases
Methane
Methane is the main component of natural gas. Its common name used
to be marsh gas because it can be seen bubbling up from marshy
areas where organic material is decomposing. Data from ice cores show
that for at least two thousand years before 1800 its concentration in the
atmosphere was about 700 ppb. Since then its concentration has more
than doubled (Figure 3.6). During the 1980s it was increasing at about
10 ppb year−1 but during the 1990s the average rate of increase fell to
around 5 ppb year−1 .9 Although the concentration of methane in the
atmosphere is much less than that of carbon dioxide (less than 2 ppm
compared with about 370 ppm for carbon dioxide), its greenhouse effect
is far from negligible. That is because the enhanced greenhouse effect
caused by a molecule of methane is about eight times that of a molecule
of carbon dioxide.10

gases. Chapter 4 in Houghton et al., Climate Change 2001. See also Prather,
M. et al. 1995. Other trace gases and atmospheric chemistry. In Climate Change
1994. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The ﬁgure for atmospheric increase is an average for the 1990s.

The main natural source of methane is from wetlands. A variety
of other sources result directly or indirectly from human activities, for
instance from leakage from natural gas pipelines and from oil wells, from
generation in rice paddy ﬁelds, from enteric fermentation (belching)
from cattle and other livestock, from the decay of rubbish in landﬁll
sites and from wood and peat burning. Details of the best estimates of
the sizes of these sources are shown in Table 3.2. Attached to many of
the numbers is a wide range of uncertainty. It is, for instance, difﬁcult to
estimate the amount produced in paddy ﬁelds averaged on a worldwide
basis. The amount varies enormously during the rice growing season
and also very widely from region to region. Similar problems arise when
trying to estimate the amount produced by animals. Measurements of
the proportions of the different isotopes of carbon (see Box on page 37)
in atmospheric methane assist considerably in helping to tie down the

43

44

The greenhouse gases

proportion which comes from fossil fuel sources, such as leakage from
mines and from natural gas pipelines.
The main process for the removal of methane from the atmosphere
is through chemical destruction. It reacts with hydroxyl (OH) radicals,
which are present in the atmosphere because of processes involving sunlight, oxygen, ozone and water vapour. The average lifetime of methane
in the atmosphere is determined by the rate of this loss process. At about
twelve years,11 it is much shorter than the lifetime of carbon dioxide.
Although most methane sources cannot be identiﬁed very precisely,
the largest sources apart from natural wetlands are closely associated
with human activities. It is interesting to note that the increase of atmospheric methane (Figure 3.6) follows very closely the growth of human
population since the Industrial Revolution. However, even without the
introduction of deliberate measures to control human-related sources
of methane because of the impact on climate change, it is not likely
that this simple relationship with human population will continue. The
IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) presented in Chapter 6 include a wide range of estimates of the growth of human-related
methane emissions during the twenty-ﬁrst century – from approximately
doubling over the century to reductions of about twenty-ﬁve per cent.
In Chapter 10 (page 253) ways are suggested in which methane emissions could be reduced and methane concentrations in the atmosphere
stabilised.

Nitrous oxide
Nitrous oxide, used as a common anaesthetic and known as laughing gas,
is another minor greenhouse gas. Its concentration in the atmosphere of
about 0.3 ppm is rising at about 0.25 per cent per year and is about
sixteen per cent greater than in pre-industrial times. It possesses a
relatively long atmospheric lifetime of about 115 years. The largest
emissions to the atmosphere are associated with natural and agricultural ecosystems; those linked with human activities are probably due
to increasing fertiliser use. Biomass burning and the chemical industry
(for example, nylon production) also play some part. The sink of nitrous
oxide is photodissociation in the stratosphere and reaction with electronically excited oxygen atoms, leading to an atmospheric lifetime of about
120 years.

Chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs) and ozone
The CFCs are man-made chemicals which, because they vaporise
just below room temperature and because they are non-toxic and

Other greenhouse gases

non-ﬂammable, appear to be ideal for use in refrigerators, the manufacture of insulation and aerosol spray cans. Since they are so chemically
unreactive, once they are released into the atmosphere they remain for
a long time – one or two hundred years – before being destroyed. As
their use increased rapidly through the 1980s their concentration in the
atmosphere has been building up so that they are now present (adding
together all the different CFCs) in about l ppb (part per thousand million – or billion – by volume). This may not sound very much, but it is
quite enough to cause two serious environmental problems.
The ﬁrst problem is that they destroy ozone.12 Ozone (O3 ), a
molecule consisting of three atoms of oxygen, is an extremely reactive
gas present in small quantities in the stratosphere (a region of the atmosphere between about 10 km and 50 km in altitude). Ozone molecules
are formed through the action of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun on
molecules of oxygen. They are in turn destroyed by a natural process as
they absorb solar ultraviolet radiation at slightly longer wavelengths –
radiation which would otherwise be harmful to us and to other forms
of life at the Earth’s surface. The amount of ozone in the stratosphere
is determined by the balance between these two processes, one forming
ozone and one destroying it. What happens when CFC molecules move
into the stratosphere is that some of the chlorine atoms they contain are
stripped off, also by the action of ultraviolet sunlight. These chlorine
atoms readily react with ozone, reducing it back to oxygen and adding
to the rate of destruction of ozone. This occurs in a catalytic cycle – one
chlorine atom can destroy many molecules of ozone.
The problem of ozone destruction was brought to world attention
in 1985 when Joe Farman, Brian Gardiner and Jonathan Shanklin at
the British Antarctic Survey discovered a region of the atmosphere over
Antarctica where, during the southern spring, about half the ozone overhead disappeared. The existence of the ‘ozone hole’ was a great surprise to the scientists; it set off an intensive investigation into its causes.
The chemistry and dynamics of its formation turned out to be complex.
They have now been unravelled, at least as far as their main features
are concerned, leaving no doubt that chlorine atoms introduced into the
atmosphere by human activities are largely responsible. Not only is there
depletion of ozone in the spring over Antarctica (and to a lesser extent
over the Arctic) but also substantial reduction, of the order of ﬁve per
cent, of the total column of ozone – the amount above one square metre at a given point on the Earth’s surface – at mid latitudes in both
hemispheres.
Because of these serious consequences of the use of CFCs, international action has been taken. Many governments have signed the Montreal Protocol set up in 1987 which, together with the Amendments

45

46

The greenhouse gases

agreed in London in 1991 and in Copenhagen in 1992, required that
manufacture of CFCs be phased out completely by the year 1996 in
industrialised countries and by 2006 in developing countries. Because
of this action the concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere is no longer
increasing. However, since they possess a long life in the atmosphere,
little decrease will be seen for some time and substantial quantities will
be present well over a hundred years from now.
So much for the problem of ozone destruction. The other problem
with CFCs and ozone, the one which concerns us here, is that they are
both greenhouse gases.13 They possess absorption bands in the region
known as the longwave atmospheric window (see Figure 2.4) where few
other gases absorb. Because, as we have seen, the CFCs destroy some
ozone, the greenhouse effect of the CFCs is partially compensated by
the reduced greenhouse effect of atmospheric ozone.
First considering the CFCs on their own, a CFC molecule added to
the atmosphere has a greenhouse effect ﬁve to ten thousand times greater
than an added molecule of carbon dioxide. Thus, despite their very small
concentration compared, for instance, with carbon dioxide, they have a
signiﬁcant greenhouse effect. It is estimated that due to the CFCs now
present in the atmosphere the radiative forcing in the tropics (at higher
latitudes there is a compensating effect due to ozone reduction which
is explained below) is about 0.25 W m−2 – or about twenty per cent of
the radiative forcing due to all greenhouse gases. This forcing will only
decrease very slowly next century.
Turning now to ozone, the effect from ozone depletion is complex
because the amount by which ozone greenhouse warming is reduced
depends critically on the height in the atmosphere at which it is being destroyed. Further, ozone depletion is concentrated at high latitudes while
the greenhouse effect of the CFCs is uniformly spread over the globe.
In tropical regions there is virtually no ozone depletion so no change in
the ozone greenhouse effect. At mid latitudes, very approximately, the
greenhouse effects of ozone reduction and of the CFCs compensate for
each other. In polar regions the reduction in the greenhouse effect of
ozone more than compensates for the greenhouse warming effect of the
CFCs.14
As CFCs are phased out, they are being replaced to some degree
by other halocarbons – hydrochloro-ﬂuorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs). In Copenhagen in 1992, the international community decided that HCFCs would also be phased out by the year 2030.
While being less destructive to ozone than the CFCs, they are still greenhouse gases. The HFCs contain no chlorine or bromine, so they do not
destroy ozone and are not covered by the Montreal Protocol. Because
of their shorter lifetime, typically tens rather than hundreds of years,

Gases with an indirect greenhouse effect

the concentration in the atmosphere of both the HCFCs and the HFCs,
and therefore their contribution to global warming for a given rate of
emission, will be less than for the CFCs. However, since their rate of
manufacture could increase substantially their potential contribution to
greenhouse warming is being included alongside other greenhouse gases
(see Chapter 10 page 247).
Concern has also extended to some other related compounds which
are greenhouse gases, the perﬂuorocarbons (e.g. CF4 , C2 F6 ) and sulphur
hexaﬂuoride (SF6 ), which are produced in some industrial processes.
Because they possess very long atmospheric lifetimes, probably more
than 1000 years, all emissions of these gases accumulate in the atmosphere and will continue to inﬂuence climate for thousands of years. They
are also therefore being included as potentially important greenhouse
gases.
Ozone is also present in the lower atmosphere or troposphere, where
some of it is transferred downwards from the stratosphere and where
some is generated by chemical action, particularly as a result of the action
of sunlight on the oxides of nitrogen. It is especially noticeable in polluted
atmospheres near the surface; if present in high enough concentration,
it can become a health hazard. In the northern hemisphere the limited
observations available together with model simulations of the chemical
reactions leading to ozone formation suggest that ozone concentrations
in the troposphere have doubled since pre-industrial times – an increase
which is estimated to have led to a global average radiative forcing of
between 0.2 and 0.6 W m−2 (Figure 3.8). Ozone is also generated at
levels in the upper troposphere as a result of the nitrogen oxides emitted
from aircraft exhausts; nitrogen oxides emitted from aircraft are more
effective at producing ozone in the upper troposphere than are equivalent
emissions at the surface. The radiative forcing in northern mid latitudes
from aircraft due to this additional ozone15 is of similar magnitude to that
from the carbon dioxide emitted from the combustion of aviation fuel
which is about three per cent of current global fossil fuel consumption.

Gases with an indirect greenhouse effect
I have described all the gases present in the atmosphere which have
a direct greenhouse effect. There are also gases which through their
chemical action on greenhouse gases, for instance on methane or on
lower atmospheric ozone, have an inﬂuence on the overall size of greenhouse warming. Carbon monoxide (CO) and the nitrogen oxides (NO and
NO2 ) emitted, for instance, by motor vehicles are some of these. Carbon
monoxide has no direct greenhouse effect of its own but, as a result of
chemical reactions, it forms carbon dioxide. These reactions also affect

47

48

The greenhouse gases

the amount of the hydroxyl radical (OH) which in turn affects the concentration of methane. Substantial research has been carried out on the
chemical processes in the atmosphere that lead to these indirect effects
on greenhouse gases.16 It is of course important to take them properly
into account, but it is also important to recognise that their combined effect is much less than that of the major contributors to human-generated
greenhouse warming, namely carbon dioxide and methane.

Particles in the atmosphere17
Small particles suspended in the atmosphere (often known as aerosol)
affect its energy balance because they both absorb radiation from the Sun
and scatter it back to space. We can easily see the effect of this on a bright
day in the summer with a light wind when downwind of an industrial
area. Although no cloud appears to be present, the sun appears hazy. We
call it ‘industrial haze’. Under these conditions a signiﬁcant proportion
of the sunlight incident at the top of the atmosphere is being lost as it
is scattered back and out of the atmosphere by the millions of small
particles (typically between 0.001 and 0.01 mm in diameter) in the haze.
Atmospheric particles come from a variety of sources. They arise
partially from natural causes; they are blown off the land surface, especially in desert areas; they result from forest ﬁres and they come from sea
spray. From time to time large quantities of particles are injected into the
upper atmosphere from volcanoes – the Pinatubo volcano which erupted
in 1991 provides a good example (see Chapter 5). Some particles are
also formed in the atmosphere itself, for instance sulphate particles from
the sulphur-containing gases emitted from volcanoes.
Other particles arise from human activities – from biomass burning
(e.g. the burning of forests) and the sulphates and soot resulting from the
burning of fossil fuels. The sulphate particles are particularly important.
They are formed as a result of chemical action on sulphur dioxide, a gas
that is produced in large quantities by power stations and other industries
in which coal and oil (both of which contain sulphur in varying quantities) are burnt. Because these particles remain in the atmosphere only
for about ﬁve days on average, their effect is mainly conﬁned to regions
near the sources of the particles, i.e. the major industrial regions of the
northern hemisphere (Figure 3.7). Over limited regions of the northern hemisphere the radiative effect of these particles is comparable in
size, although opposite in effect, to that of human-generated greenhouse
gases up to the present time. Estimates of the direct radiative forcing, averaged over the globe, due to the particles from various human-generated
sources are shown in Figure 3.8. It will be seen that there are substantial
uncertainties associated with these estimates.

Particles in the atmosphere

Figure 3.7 Modelled geographic distribution of estimates of the annual mean
direct radiative forcing (in watts per square metre) from anthropogenic sulphate
aerosols in the troposphere. The radiative forcing, which is negative, is largest in
regions close to industrial activity.

So far for aerosol we have been describing direct radiative forcing.
There is a further way by which particles in the atmosphere could inﬂuence the climate; that is through their effect on cloud formation that
is described as indirect radiative forcing. Two mechanisms of indirect
forcing have been proposed. The ﬁrst is the inﬂuence of the number of
particles and their size on cloud radiative properties. It arises as follows.
If particles are present in large numbers when clouds are forming, the
resulting cloud consists of a large number of smaller drops – smaller
than would otherwise be the case – this is similar to what happens as
polluted fogs form in cities. Such a cloud will be more highly reﬂecting
to sunlight than one consisting of larger particles, thus further increasing
the energy loss resulting from the presence of the particles. The second
mechanism arises because of the inﬂuence of droplet size and number on
precipitation efﬁciency, the lifetime of clouds and hence the geographic
extent of cloudiness. There is observational evidence for both of these
mechanisms but the processes involved are difﬁcult to model and will
vary a great deal with the particular situation. Estimates of their magnitude as shown in Figure 3.8 therefore remain very uncertain. To reﬁne
these estimates, more studies need to be made especially by making
careful measurements on suitable clouds.
The estimates for the radiative effects of particles as in Figure 3.8
can be compared with the global average radiative forcing to date due

rectangular bar denotes a best estimate value while its absence denotes no best

‘o’ delimiters indicates estimates of the uncertainty ranges. A ‘level of scientiﬁc
understanding (LOSU)’ index is accorded to each forcing, with H, M, L and VL
denoting high, medium, low and very low levels respectively. This represents a
judgement about the reliability of the forcing estimate involving factors such as
the assumptions necessary to evaluate the forcing, the degree of knowledge of
the mechanisms determining the forcing and the uncertainties surrounding the
quantitative estimate of the forcing. The well-mixed greenhouse gases are
grouped together into a single rectangular bar with the individual contributions
shown. The second and third bars apply to stratospheric and tropospheric
ozone. The next bars denote the direct effect of aerosols. FF denotes aerosol
from fossil fuel burning and is separated into black carbon (bc) and organic
carbon (oc) components. BB denotes aerosols from biomass burning. The sign
of the effects due to mineral dust is itself an uncertainty. Only the ﬁrst indirect
aerosol effect is estimated as little quantitative evidence exists regarding the
second. All the forcings have distinct spatial and seasonal variations (see Figure
3.7) so that they cannot be added up and viewed a priori as providing offsets in
terms of complete global climate impact.

Questions

to the increase in greenhouse gases of about 2.6 W m−2 . Comparing
global average forcings, however, is not the whole story. Because of
the large regional variation of particles in the atmosphere (Figure 3.7),
any effect they have on the climate can be expected to be substantially
different from the effect of increases in greenhouse gases, which is much
more uniform over the globe. This will be illustrated in Chapter 5 where
we consider the likely pattern of anthropogenic climate change to date.
More consideration of it will also be given in Chapter 6 when discussing
projections of climate change on regional scales that can depend critically
on assumptions about the likely concentrations of atmospheric particles
in the future.
An important factor that will inﬂuence the future concentrations of
sulphate particles is ‘acid rain’ pollution, caused mainly by sulphur dioxide emissions. This leads to the degradation of forests and ﬁsh stocks in
lakes especially in regions downwind of major industrial areas. Serious
efforts are therefore under way, especially in Europe and North America,
to curb these emissions to a substantial degree. Although the amount
of sulphur-rich coal being burnt elsewhere in the world, for instance
in Asia, is increasing rapidly, the damaging effects of sulphur pollution
are such that tight controls on sulphur emissions are being extended to
these regions also. For the globe as a whole therefore, sulphur emissions
are likely to rise much less rapidly than emissions of carbon dioxide;
the IPCC SRES scenarios of future emissions as presented in Chapter 6
anticipate these changes. The climate change resulting from an increase
in sulphate particles therefore will become increasingly less by comparison with that from the likely increase of greenhouse gases.

Estimates of radiative forcing
This chapter has summarised current scientiﬁc knowledge about the
sources and sinks of the main greenhouse gases and the exchanges which
occur between the components of the climate system – the atmosphere,
the ocean and the land surface – including the close balances that are
maintained between the different components and the way in which these
balances are being disturbed by human-generated emissions. Different
assumptions about future emissions have been used to generate emission
scenarios. From these scenarios estimates have been made (for carbon
dioxide, for instance, using a computer model of the carbon cycle) of
likely increases in greenhouse gas concentrations in the future.
Given information about the possible increases in greenhouse gases,
the next step is to calculate the effect of these increases on the amounts
of thermal (infrared) radiation absorbed and emitted by the atmosphere.

51

52

The greenhouse gases

This is done using information about how the different gases absorb
radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum, as mentioned in Chapter 2.
The radiative forcing associated with the increases in each of the gases
can then be calculated. In Figure 3.8 are brought together estimates of
global average radiative forcing for the period from 1750 to 2000 for
the different greenhouse gases and for tropospheric aerosols of different
origins which we have been considering in this chapter.
It is useful to be able to compare the radiative forcing generated by
the different greenhouse gases. Because of their different life-times, the
future proﬁle of radiative forcing due to releases of greenhouse gases
varies very much from gas to gas. An index called the global warming potential (GWP) has been deﬁned for greenhouse gases that takes
the ratio of the time-integrated radiative forcing from the instantaneous
release of 1 kg of a given gas to that from the release of 1 kg of carbon dioxide. A time horizon has also to be speciﬁed for the period over
which the integration is carried out. The GWPs of the six greenhouse
gases included in the Kyoto Protocol are listed in Table 10.2. Applying
the GWPs to the emissions from a mixture of greenhouse gases enables
the mixture to be considered in terms of an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. However, because the GWPs for different time horizons are
very different, GWPs are of limited application and must be used with
care.
When considering radiative forcing of climate, the question is bound
to be asked as to whether variations have occurred or are likely to occur
in the amount of energy from the Sun that is incident on the Earth and
that could, therefore, affect the climate. We shall see, for instance, in the
next chapter that ice ages in the past have been triggered by variations in
the geometry of the Earth’s orbit. It is considered possible that the Sun’s
output itself could vary by small amounts over time (see box in Chapter 6
page 138). Figure 3.8 (see also Figure 6.12) indicates the range of estimates of solar variability that may have occurred since 1850 showing
that its inﬂuence is much less than that of the increase in greenhouse
gases.
Also included in Figure 3.8 are the possible effects of aviation on
radiative forcing and effects due to land-use changes that arise because
of changes in the albedo (see Glossary) of the surface. The effects of
aviation that are in addition to the source of carbon dioxide emissions it
provides arise from its inﬂuence on high cloud cover through its emissions of water vapour. As we shall see in Chapter 5 (page 91) high
cloud provides a blanketing effect on the Earth’s surface similar to that
of greenhouse gases and therefore leads to positive radiative forcing.
Many examples exist of extensive contrail formation over regions where
many aircraft ﬂights regularly occur. Aircraft may also inﬂuence cirrus

Questions

cloud formation through the effect of the particles in aircraft emissions.
The overall greenhouse effect of aircraft has been estimated as up to
the equivalent of two or three times the effect of their carbon dioxide
emissions.18
Details of radiative forcings as projected for the twenty-ﬁrst century
are presented in Chapter 6 (page 120). Chapters 5 and 6 will explain how
estimates of radiative forcing can be incorporated into computer climate
models so as to predict the climate change that is likely to occur because
of human activities. However, before considering predictions of future
climate change, it is helpful to gain perspective by looking at some of
the climate changes that have occurred in the past.
Questions
1 The lifetime of a carbon dioxide molecule in the atmosphere before it is
exchanged with the ocean is typically less than a year, while the time taken
for an increase in carbon dioxide concentration from fossil fuel burning to
diminish substantially is typically many years. Explain the reasons for this
difference.
2 Estimate how much carbon dioxide you emit each year through breathing.
3 Estimate the size of your share of carbon dioxide emissions from the burning
of fossil fuels.
4 A typical city in the developed world with a population of about one million
produces about half a million tonnes of municipal waste each year. Suppose
the waste is buried in a landﬁll site where the waste decays producing equal
quantities of carbon dioxide and methane. Making assumptions about the
likely carbon content of the waste and the proportion that eventually decays,
estimate the annual production of methane. If all the methane leaks away,
using the information in note 10, compare the greenhouse effect of the carbon
dioxide and methane produced from the landﬁll site with that of the carbon
dioxide produced if the waste were incinerated instead.
5 A new forest is planted containing a million trees which will mature in forty
years. Estimate the amount of carbon sequestered per year by the forest.
6 Find ﬁgures for the amount of fuel used by a typical aircraft and the size of
ﬂeets of the world’s airlines and airforces and estimate the carbon dioxide
emitted globally each year by the world’s aircraft.
7 Search for information about the ozone hole and explain why it occurs mainly
in the Antarctic.
8 What are the main uses of CFCs? Suggest ways in which the emissions of
CFCs to the atmosphere could be reduced more rapidly.
9 Evidence is sometimes presented suggesting that the variations in global average temperature over the last century or more can all be explained as due
to variations in the energy output of the Sun. There is therefore nothing left
to attribute to the increase in greenhouse gases. What is the fallacy in this
argument?

top of the troposphere rather than at the top of the whole atmosphere.

about 23 for the 100 year time horizon. About seventy-ﬁve per cent of the
contribution of methane to the greenhouse effect is because of its direct
effect on the outgoing thermal radiation. The other twenty-ﬁve per cent
arises because of its inﬂuence on the overall chemistry of the atmosphere.
Increased methane eventually results in small increases in water vapour in
the upper atmosphere, in tropospheric ozone and in carbon dioxide, all of
which in turn add to the greenhouse effect.
Taking into account the loss processes due to reaction with OH in the troposphere, chemical reactions and soil loss lead to a lifetime of about ten years.
However, the effective lifetime of methane against a perturbation in concentration in the atmosphere (the number quoted here) is complex because
it depends on the methane concentration. This is because the concentration
of the radical OH (interaction with which is the main cause of methane
destruction), due to chemical feedbacks, is itself dependent on the methane
concentration (more details in Prather et al., Chapter 4, in Houghton et al.,
Climate Change 2001).

Chapter 4

Climates of the past

To obtain some perspective against which to view future climate
change, it is helpful to look at some of the climate changes that have
occurred in the past. This chapter will brieﬂy consider climatic records
and climate changes in three periods: the last hundred years, then the
last thousand years and ﬁnally the last million years. At the end of the
chapter some interesting recent evidence for the existence of relatively
rapid climate change at various times during the past one or two hundred
thousand years will be presented.

The last hundred years
The 1980s and early 1990s have brought unusually warm years for the
globe as a whole (see Chapter 1) as is illustrated in Figure 4.1, which
shows the global average temperature since 1860, the period for which
the instrumental record is available with good accuracy and coverage.
An increase over this period has taken place of about 0.6 ◦ C (ninety-ﬁve
per cent conﬁdence limits of 0.4 to 0.8 ◦ C). The year 1998 is very likely1
to have been the warmest year during this period. An even more striking
statistic is that each of the ﬁrst eight months of 1998 was very likely the
warmest of those months in the record. Although there is a distinct trend
in the record, the increase is by no means a uniform one. In fact, some
periods of cooling as well as warming have occurred and an obvious
feature of the record is the degree of variability from year to year and
from decade to decade.
A sceptic may wonder how a diagram like Figure 4.1 can be prepared
and whether any reliance can be placed upon it. After all, temperature

varies from place to place, from season to season and from day to day by
many tens of degrees. But here we are not considering changes in local
temperature but in the average over the whole globe. A change of a few
tenths of a degree in that average is a large change.
First of all, just how is a change in global average temperature estimated from a combination of records of changes in the near-surface
temperature over land and changes in the temperature of the sea surface?
To estimate the changes over land, weather stations are chosen where
consistent observations have been taken from the same location over a
substantial proportion of the whole 130-year period. Changes in sea surface temperature have been estimated by processing over sixty million
observations from ships – mostly merchant ships – over the same period.
All the observations, from land stations and from ships, are then located
within a grid of squares, say 1◦ of latitude by 1◦ of longitude, covering
the Earth’s surface. Observations within each square are averaged; the
global average is obtained by averaging (after weighting them by area)
over the averages for each of the squares.

Climates of the past

A number of research groups in different countries have made careful
and independent analyses of these observations. In somewhat different
ways they have made allowances for factors that could have introduced
artiﬁcial changes in the records. For instance, the record at some land
stations could have been affected by changes in their surroundings as
these have become more urban. In the case of ships, the standard method
of observation used to be to insert a thermometer into a bucket of water
taken from the sea. Small changes of temperature have been shown to
occur during this process; the size of the changes varies between day and
night and is also dependent on several other factors including the material
from which the bucket is made – over the years wooden, canvas and metal
buckets have been variously employed. Nowadays, a large proportion of
the observations are made by measuring the temperature of the water
entering the engine cooling system. Careful analysis of the effects of
these details on observations both on land and from ships has enabled
appropriate corrections to be made to the record, and good agreement
has been achieved between analyses carried out at different centres.
Conﬁdence that the observed variations are real is increased by noticing that the trend and the shape of the changes are similar when different
selections of the total observations are made. For instance, the separate
records from the land and sea surface and from the northern and southern hemispheres are closely in accord. Further indirect indicators such
as changes in borehole temperatures and sub-surface ocean temperatures, decrease in snow cover and glacier shrinkage provide independent
support for the observed warming.
During the last thirty years or so observations have been available
from satellites orbiting around the Earth. Their great advantage is that
they automatically provide data with global coverage, which are often
lacking in other data sets. The length of the record from satellites, however, is generally less than twenty years, a comparatively short period in
climate terms. It has been suggested that satellite measurements of lower
atmospheric temperature since 1979 are not consistent with the trend of
rising temperatures in surface observations. The satellite observations
do not cast doubt on the accuracy of the surface measurements – the two
measurements are of different quantities. However, it is expected that
trends in lower atmosphere measurements and surface measurements
should be related and much careful work has been carried out studying
the two records and interpreting the differences (see box).
The most obvious feature of the climate record illustrated in
Figure 4.1 is that of considerable variability, not just from year to year,
but from decade to decade. Some of this variability will have arisen
through causes external to the atmosphere and the oceans, for instance
as a result of volcanic eruptions such as those of Krakatoa in 1883 or of

The last hundred years

Atmospheric temperature observed by satellites
Since 1979 meteorological satellites ﬂown by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States have carried
a microwave instrument, the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU), for the
remote observation of the average temperature of the lower part of the
atmosphere.
Figure. 4.2(a) shows the record of global average temperature deduced from the MSU and compares it with data from sounding instruments carried on balloons for the same region of the atmosphere, showing
very good agreement for the period of overlap. The record of temperature
at the surface is also added for comparison over the period from 1960
to 2000. All three measurements show similar variability, the variations
at the surface tracking well with those in the lower troposphere. The
plots also illustrate the difﬁculty of deriving accurate trends from a short
period of record where there is also substantial variability. Since 1979 the
trends from the three measurement sources have been carefully studied
and compared. They are 0.04 ± 0.11 ◦ C per decade and 0.03 ± 0.10 ◦ C
per decade for the satellite and balloon data respectively compared with
0.16 ± 0.06 ◦ C per decade for the surface data. The trend in the difference of the surface and lower troposphere of 0.13 ± 0.06 ◦ C per decade
is statistically signiﬁcant. This is in contrast to near-zero surface temperature trends from 1958 to 1978 when the global lower troposphere
temperature warmed by about 0.03 ◦ C per decade relative to the surface.
There are substantial regional variations in the differences between surface and lower tropospheric temperature trends since 1979. For instance,
the differences are particularly apparent in many parts of the tropics and
sub-tropics where the surface has warmed faster than the lower troposphere, while over some other regions, e.g. North America, Europe and
Australia, the trends are very similar.
Why the surface and lower temperature trends show signiﬁcant differences, especially over the tropical and sub-tropical oceans, is not completely understood although there are a number of possible reasons for
the differences.2 It is of course well known that the presence of increased
concentrations of greenhouse gases leads to cooling of the atmosphere
at higher levels (see Chapter 2). In the stratosphere therefore the temperature trends are reversed (Figure 4.2(b)) ranging from a decrease of
about 0.5 ◦ C per decade in the lower stratosphere to 2.5 ◦ C per decade in
the upper stratosphere.

Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 (the low global average temperature
in 1992 and 1993, compared with neighbouring years, is almost certainly
due to the Pinatubo volcano). But there is no need to invoke volcanoes or
other external causes to explain all the variations in the record. Many of

them result from internal variations within the total climate system, for
instance between different parts of the ocean. (See Chapter 5 for more
details.)
The warming during the twentieth century has not been uniform
over the globe. For instance, the recent warming has been greatest over
Northern Hemisphere continents at mid to high latitudes. There have
also been areas of cooling, for instance over some parts of the
North Atlantic ocean associated with changes in ocean circulation (see
Chapter 5). Some of the recent regional patterns of temperature change
are related to different phases of atmosphere-ocean oscillations, such as
the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The positive phase of the NAO,

The last hundred years

with high pressure over the sub-tropical Atlantic and southern Europe
and mild winters over northwest Europe, has tended to be dominant since
the mid 1980s.
An interesting feature of the increasing temperature during the last
few decades has been that, in the daily cycle of temperature, minimum
temperatures over land have increased about twice as much as maximum
temperatures. A likely explanation for this, in addition to the effects of
enhanced greenhouse gases, is an increase in cloud cover which has
been observed in many of the areas with reduced temperature range. An
increase in cloud tends to obstruct daytime sunshine and tends also to
reduce the escape of terrestrial radiation at night.
As might be expected the increases in temperature have led on
average to increases in precipitation, although precipitation shows even
more variability in both space and time than temperature. The increases
have been particularly noticeable in the northern hemisphere in mid to
high latitudes, often appearing particularly as increases in heavy rainfall
events (see Table 4.1).
The broad features of these changes in temperature and precipitation
are consistent with what is expected because of the inﬂuence of increased
greenhouse gases (see Chapter 5), although there is much variability in
the record that arises for reasons not associated with human activities.
For instance, the particular increase from 1910 to 1940 (Figure 4.1)
is too rapid to have been due to the rather small increase in greenhouse
gases during that period. The particular reasons for this will be discussed
in the next chapter where comparisons of observed temperatures with
simulations from climate models for the whole of the twentieth century
will be presented, not just as they concern the global mean but also
the regional patterns of change. We conclude there that, although the
expected signal is still emerging from the noise of natural variability,
most of the observed warming over the last ﬁfty years is likely to have
been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.3
Signiﬁcant cooling of the lower stratosphere (the region at altitudes
between about 10 and 30 km) has been observed over the last two decades
(Figure 4.2). This is to be expected both because of the decrease in the
concentration of ozone (which absorbs solar radiation) and because of the
increased carbon dioxide concentration which leads to increased cooling
at these levels (see Chapter 2).
A further source of information regarding climate change comes
from measurements of change in sea level. Over the last hundred years sea
level has risen by between 10 and 20 cm. The best known contributions
to this rise are from the thermal expansion of ocean water because of
the global average temperature rise (estimated as up to about 7 cm)

and from glaciers which have generally been retreating over the last
century (estimated as up to about 4 cm). The net contribution from the
Greenland and Antarctic ice caps is more uncertain but is believed to be
small.
In Chapter 1, we mentioned the increasing vulnerability of human populations to climate extremes, which has brought about more

64

Climates of the past

awareness of recent extremes in the forms of ﬂoods, droughts, tropical
cyclones and windstorms. It is therefore of great importance to know
whether there is evidence of an increase in the frequency or severity of
these and other extreme events. The available evidence regarding how
these and other relevant parameters have changed during the twentieth
century is summarised in Table 4.1 in terms of different indicators: concentrations of greenhouse gases; temperature, hydrological and stormrelated indicators and biological and physical indicators. To what extent
these changes are expected to continue or to intensify during the twentyﬁrst century will be addressed in Chapter 6.
Eventually, as greenhouse gases increase further, the amount of
warming is expected to become sufﬁciently large that it will swamp
the natural variations in climate. In the meantime, the global average
temperature may continue to increase or it could, because of natural
variability, show periods of decrease. Over the next few years, scientists
will be inspecting climate changes and climate events most carefully
as they occur to see how far actual events can be related to scientiﬁc
predictions especially those associated with increasing greenhouse gas
emissions. Some details of these predictions will be discussed in later
chapters especially Chapter 6.

The last thousand years
The detailed systematic record of weather parameters such as temperature, rainfall, cloudiness and the like presented above for the last
140 years and which covers a good proportion of the globe is not available for earlier periods. Further back, the record is more sparse and doubt
arises over the consistency of the instruments used for observation. Most
thermometers in use 200 years ago were not well calibrated or carefully
exposed. However, many diarists and writers kept records at different
times; from a wide variety of sources weather and climate information
can be pieced together. Indirect sources, such as are provided by ice cores,
tree rings and records of lake levels, of glacier advance and retreat, and
of pollen distribution, can also yield information to assist in building
up the whole climatic story. From a variety of sources, for instance, it
has been possible to put together for China a systematic atlas of weather
patterns covering the last 500 years.
Similarly, from direct and indirect sources, it has been possible to
deduce the average temperature over the Northern Hemisphere for the
last millennium (Figure 4.3). Sufﬁcient data are not available for the
same reconstruction to be carried out over the Southern Hemisphere.
In Figure 4.3 it is just possible to identify the ‘Medieval Warm Period’
associated with the eleventh to fourteenth centuries and a relatively cool

period the ‘Little Ice Age’ associated with the ﬁfteenth to nineteenth
centuries. These only affected part of the Northern Hemisphere and
are therefore more prominent in local records, for instance those from
central England. The increase in temperature over the twentieth century
is particularly striking. The 1990s are likely to have been the warmest
decade of the millennium in the Northern Hemisphere and 1998 is likely
to have been the warmest year.
Although there is as yet no certain explanation for the variations that
occurred between 1000 and 1900, it is clear that greenhouse gases such
as carbon dioxide and methane cannot have been the cause of change.
For the millennium before 1800 their concentration in the atmosphere
was rather stable, the carbon dioxide concentration, for instance, varying by less than three per cent. However, the combined inﬂuences of
variations in volcanic activity and variations in the output of energy
from the Sun can provide some part of the explanation.4 The effect of
individual volcanic eruptions can be very noticeable. For instance, one of
the largest eruptions during the period was that of Tambora in Indonesia

1800

2000

66

Climates of the past

in April 1815, which was followed in many places by two exceptionally cold years: 1816 was described in New England and Canada as the
‘year without a summer’. Although the effect on the climate even of
an eruption of the magnitude of Tambora only lasts a few years, variations in average volcanic activity have a longer term effect. Regarding
the Sun’s output, although accurate direct measurements are not available (apart from those made during the last two decades from satellite
instruments), other evidence suggests that the solar output could have
varied signiﬁcantly in the past. For instance, compared with its value
today it may have been somewhat lower (by a few tenths of a watt per
square metre) during the Maunder Minimum in the seventeenth century
(a period when almost no sunspots were recorded; see also box on p. 138).
There is no need, however, to invoke volcanoes or variations in solar
output as the cause of all the climate variations over this period. As
with the shorter-term changes mentioned earlier, such variations of climate can arise naturally from internal variations within the atmosphere
and the ocean and in the two-way relationship – coupling – between
them.
The millennial record of Figure 4.3 is particularly important because it provides an indication of the range and character of climate
variability that arises from natural causes. As we shall see in the next
chapter, climate models also provide some information on natural climate variability. Careful assessments of these observational and model
results conﬁrm that natural variability (the combination of internal variability and naturally forced, e.g. by volcanoes or change in solar output)
is unlikely to explain the warming in the latter half of the twentieth
century.5

The past million years
To go back before recorded human history, scientists have to rely on
indirect methods to unravel much of the story of the past climate. A
particularly valuable information source is the record stored in the ice that
caps Greenland and the Antarctic continent. These ice caps are several
thousands of metres thick. Snow deposited on their surface gradually
becomes compacted as further snow falls, becoming solid ice. The ice
moves steadily downwards, eventually ﬂowing outwards at the bottom of
the ice-sheet. Ice near the top of the layer will have been deposited fairly
recently; ice near the bottom will have fallen on the surface many tens
or hundreds of thousands of years ago. Analysis of the ice at different
levels can, therefore, provide information about the conditions prevailing
at different times in the past.

The past million years

Deep cores have been drilled out of the ice at several locations in both
Greenland and Antarctica. At Russia’s Vostok station in east Antarctica,
for instance, drilling has been carried out for over twenty years. The
longest and most recent core reached a depth of over 3.5 km; the ice
at the bottom of the hole fell as snow on the surface of the Antarctic
continent over 400 000 years ago.
Small bubbles of air are trapped within the ice. Analysis of the composition of that air shows what was present in the atmosphere for the

Paleoclimate reconstruction from isotope data
The isotope 18 O is present in natural oxygen at a concentration of about 1
part in 500 compared with the more abundant isotope 16 O. When water
evaporates, water containing the lighter isotope is more easily vaporised, so that water vapour in the atmosphere contains less 18 O compared
with sea water. Similar separation occurs in the process of condensation
when ice crystals form in clouds. The amount of separation between the
two oxygen isotopes in these processes depends on the temperatures at
which evaporation and condensation occur. Measurements on snowfall
in different places can be used to calibrate the method; it is found that the
concentration of 18 O varies by about 0.7 of a part per thousand for each
degree of change in average temperature at the surface. Information is
therefore available in the ice cores taken from polar ice caps concerning the variation in atmospheric temperature in polar regions during the
whole period when the ice core was laid down.
Since the ice caps are formed from accumulated snowfall which
contains less 18 O compared with sea water, the concentration of 18 O in
water from the oceans provides a measure of the total volume of the
ice in the ice caps; it changes by about one part in 1000 between the
maximum ice extent of the ice ages and the warm periods in between.
Information about the 18 O content of ocean water at different times is
locked up in corals and in cores of sediment taken from the ocean bottom, which contain carbonates from fossils of plankton and small sea
creatures from past centuries and millennia. Measurements of radioactive isotopes, such as the carbon isotope 14 C, and correlations with other
signiﬁcant past events enable the corals and sediment cores to be dated.
Since the separation between the oxygen isotopes which occurs as these
creatures are formed also depends on the temperature of the sea water
(although the dependence is weaker than the other dependencies considered above) information is also available about the distribution of ocean
surface temperature at different times in the past.6

67

Climates of the past

time at which the ice was formed – gases such as carbon dioxide or
methane. Dust particles that may have come from volcanoes or from
the sea surface are also contained within the ice. Further information is
provided by analysis of the ice itself. Small quantities of different oxygen
isotopes and of the heavy isotope of hydrogen (deuterium) are contained
in the ice. The ratios of these isotopes that are present depend sensitively
on the temperatures at which evaporation and condensation took place
for the water in the clouds from which the ice originated (see box above).
These in turn are dependent on the average temperature near the surface
of the Earth. A temperature record for the polar regions can therefore
be constructed from analyses of the ice cores. The associated changes in
global average temperature are estimated to be about half the changes in
the polar regions.
Such a reconstruction from a Vostok core for the temperature and
the carbon dioxide content is shown in Figure 4.4 for the past 160 000
years, which includes the last major ice age that began about 120 000
years ago and began to come to an end about 20 000 years ago. It also
demonstrates the close connections that exist between temperature and
carbon dioxide concentrations. Similar close correlation is found with
the methane concentration. Note from Figure 4.4 the likely growth of
atmospheric carbon dioxide during the twenty-ﬁrst century, taking it to
levels that are unlikely to have been exceeded during the past twenty
million years.
Data from ice cores can take us back 400 000 years or so over four
ice age cycles during which the correlations between temperature and
carbon dioxide concentrations shown in Figure 4.4 are repeated.7 To
go further back, over the past million years, the composition of ocean
sediments can be investigated to yield information. Fossils of plankton
and other small sea creatures deposited in these sediments also contain
different isotopes of oxygen. In particular the amount of the heavier
isotope of oxygen (18 O) compared with the more abundant isotope (16 O)
is sensitive both to the temperature at which the fossils were formed and
to the total volume of ice in the world’s ice caps at the time of the fossils’
formation (see box above). For instance, from oxygen isotope and other
data we can deduce that the sea level at the last glacial maximum, 20 000
years ago, was about 120 m lower than today.
From the variety of paleoclimate data available, variations in the
volume of ice in the ice caps can be reconstructed over the greater part
of the last million years (Figure 4.5(c)). In this record six or seven major
ice ages can be identiﬁed with warmer periods in between, the period
between these major ice ages being approximately 100 000 years. Other
cycles are also evident in the record.

The past million years

Figure 4.4 Variations over the last 160 000 years of polar temperature and
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations derived from the Vostok ice core
from Antarctica. It is estimated that the variation of global average temperature
is about half that in the polar regions. Also shown is the current carbon dioxide
concentration of about 370 ppm and the likely rise during the twenty-ﬁrst
century under various projections of its growth.

The most obvious place to look for the cause of regular cycles in
climate is outside the Earth, in the Sun’s radiation. Has this varied in the
past in a cyclic way? So far as is known the output of the Sun itself has not
changed to any large extent over the last million years or so. But because
of variations in the Earth’s orbit, the distribution of solar radiation has
varied in a more or less regular way during the last millennium.
Three regular variations occur in the orbit of the Earth around the
Sun (Figure 4.5(a)). The Earth’s orbit, although nearly circular, is actually
an ellipse. The eccentricity of the ellipse (which is related to the ratio
between the greatest and the least diameters) varies with a period of
about 100 000 years; that is the slowest of the three variations. The Earth
also spins on its own axis, the axis of spin being tilted with respect
to the axis of the Earth’s orbit, the angle of tilt varying between 21.6◦
and 24.5◦ (currently it is 23.5◦ ) with a period of about 41 000 years.

69

70

Climates of the past

The third variation is of the time of year when the Earth is closest to
the Sun (the Earth’s perihelion). The time of perihelion moves through
the months of the year with a period of about 23 000 years (see also
Figure 5.19); in the present conﬁguration, the Earth is closest to the Sun in
January.
As the Earth’s orbit changes its relationship to the Sun, although the
total quantity of solar radiation reaching the Earth varies very little, the
distribution of that radiation with latitude and season over the Earth’s
surface changes considerably. The changes are especially large in polar
regions where the variations in summer sunshine, for instance, reach
about ten per cent (Figure 4.5(b)). James Croll, a British scientist, ﬁrst
pointed out in 1867 that the major ice ages of the past might be linked
with these regular variations in the seasonal distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth. His ideas were developed in 1920 by Milutin
Milankovitch, a climatologist from Yugoslavia, whose name is usually
linked with the theory. Inspection by eye of the relationship between the
variations of polar summer sunshine and global ice volume shown in
Figure 4.5 suggests a signiﬁcant connection. Careful study of the correlation between the two curves conﬁrms this and demonstrates that sixty
per cent of the variance in the climatic record of global ice volume falls
close to the three frequencies of regular variations in the Earth’s orbit,
thus providing support for the Milankovitch theory.
More careful study of the relationship between the ice ages and the
Earth’s orbital variations shows that the size of the climate changes is
larger than might be expected from forcing by the radiation changes
alone. Other processes that enhance the effect of the radiation changes
(in other words, positive feedback processes) have to be introduced to explain the climate variations. One such feedback arises from the changes in
carbon dioxide inﬂuencing atmospheric temperature through the greenhouse effect, illustrated by the strong correlation observed in the climatic
record between average atmospheric temperature and carbon dioxide
concentration (Figure 4.4). Such a correlation does not, of course, prove
the existence of the greenhouse feedback; in fact part of the correlation
arises because the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is itself inﬂuenced, through biological feedbacks (see Chapter 3), by factors related
to the average global temperature. However, as we shall see in Chapter 5,
climates of the past cannot be modelled successfully without taking the
greenhouse feedback into account.8
An obvious question to ask is when, on the Milankovitch theory, is
the next ice age due? It so happens that we are currently in a period of
relatively small solar radiation variations and the best projections for the
long term are of a longer than normal interglacial period leading to the
beginning of a new ice age perhaps in 50 000 years’ time.9

How stable has past climate been?
The major climate changes considered so far in this chapter have taken
place relatively slowly. The growth and recession of the large polar
ice-sheets between the ice ages and the intervening warmer interglacial
periods have taken on average many thousands of years. However, the ice
core records such as those in Figures 4.4 and 4.6 show evidence of large
and relatively rapid ﬂuctuations. Ice cores from Greenland provide more
detailed evidence of these than those from Antarctica. This is because at
the summit of the Greenland ice cap, the rate of accumulation of snow

Figure 4.6 Variations in Arctic temperature over the past 100 000 years as
deduced from oxygen isotope measurements (in terms of δ18 O) from the
‘Summit’ ice core in Greenland. The quantity δ18 O plotted in Figures 4.6 and 4.7
is the difference (in parts per thousand) between the 18 O/16 O ratio in the sample
and the same ratio in a laboratory standard. The overall shape of the record is
similar to that from the Vostok ice core shown in Figure 4.4 but much more
detail is apparent in the ‘Summit’ record’s stable period over the last 8000 years.
A change of ﬁve parts per thousand in δ18 O in the ice core corresponds to about

has been higher than that at the Antarctica drilling locations. For a given
period in the past, the relevant part of the Greenland ice core is longer
and more detail of variations over relatively short periods is therefore
available.
The data show that the last 8000 years have been unusually stable
compared with earlier epochs. In fact, as judged from the Vostok (Figure 4.4) and the Greenland records (Figure 4.6) this long stable period in
the Holocene is a unique feature of climate during the past 420 000 years.
It has been suggested that this had profound implications for the development of civilisations.10 Model simulations (see Chapter 5) indicate
that the detail of long-term changes during the Holocene is consistent
with the inﬂuence of orbital forcing (Figure 4.5).
It is also interesting to inspect the rate of temperature change during
the recovery period from the last glacial maximum about 20 000 years
ago and compare it with recent temperature changes. The data indicate
an average warming rate of about 0.2 ◦ C per century between 20 000
and 10 000 years before present (BP) over Greenland, with lower rates

How stable has past climate been?

for other regions. Compare this with a temperature rise during the twentieth century of about 0.6 ◦ C and the rates of change of a few degrees
centigrade per century projected to occur during the twenty-ﬁrst century
because of human activities (see Chapter 6).
The ice core data (Figures 4.6) demonstrate that a series of rapid
warm and cold oscillations called Dansgaard–Oeschger events punctuated the last glaciation. Comparison between the results from ice cores
drilled at different locations within the Greenland ice cap conﬁrm the
details up to about 100 000 years ago. Comparison with data from Antarctica suggests that the ﬂuctuations of temperature over Greenland (perhaps
up to 16 ◦ C) have been larger than those over Antarctica. Similar large
and relatively rapid variations are evident from North Atlantic deep sea
sediment cores.
Another particularly interesting period of climatic history, more recently, is the Younger Dryas event (so called because it was marked by
the spread of an arctic ﬂower, Dryas octopetala), which occurred over a
period of about 1500 years between about 12 000 and 10 700 years ago.
For 6000 years before the start of this event the Earth had been warming
up after the end of the last ice age. But then during the Younger Dryas
period, as demonstrated from many different sources of paleoclimatic
data, the climate swung back again into much colder conditions similar
to those at the end of the last ice age (Figure 4.7). The ice core record
shows that at the end of the event, 10 700 years ago, the warming in
the Arctic of about 7 ◦ C occurred over only about ﬁfty years and was
associated with decreased storminess (shown by a dramatic fall in the
amount of dust in the ice core) and an increase of precipitation of about
ﬁfty per cent.
Two main reasons for these rapid variations in the past have been
suggested. One reason particularly applicable to ice age conditions is
that, as the ice-sheets over Greenland and eastern Canada have built
up, major break-ups have occurred from time to time, releasing massive
numbers of icebergs into the North Atlantic in what are called Heinrich
events. The second possibility is that the ocean circulation in the North
Atlantic region has been strongly affected by injections of fresh water
from the melting of ice. At present the ocean circulation in this region
is strongly inﬂuenced by cold salty water sinking to deep ocean levels
because its saltiness makes it dense; this sinking process is part of the
‘conveyor belt’ which is the major feature of the circulation of deep ocean
water around the world (see Figure 5.18). Large quantities of fresh water
from the melting of ice would make the water less salty, preventing it
from sinking and thereby altering the whole Atlantic circulation.
This link between the melting of ice and the ocean circulation
is a key feature of the explanation put forward by Professor Wallace

Broecker for the Younger Dryas event.11 As the great ice-sheet over
north America began to melt at the end of the last ice age, the melt water
at ﬁrst drained through the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico. Eventually, however, the retreat of the ice opened up a channel for the water
in the region of the St Lawrence river. This inﬂux of fresh water into the
North Atlantic reduced its saltiness, thus, Broecker postulates, cutting
off the formation of deep water and that part of the ocean ‘conveyor
belt’.12 Warm water was therefore prevented from ﬂowing northward,
resulting in a reversal to much colder conditions. The suggestion is
also that a reversal of this process with the starting up of the Atlantic
‘conveyor belt’ could lead to a sudden onset of warmer conditions.

explanation which involve the deep ocean circulation. It is also clear
from paleodata that large changes have occurred at different times in the
past in the formation of deep water and in the deep ocean circulation.
Chapter 3 mentioned the possibility of such changes being induced by
global warming through the growth of greenhouse gas concentrations.
Our perspective regarding the possibilities of future climate change needs
to take into account the rapid climate changes that have occurred in the
past.
Having now in these early chapters set the scene, by describing the
basic science of global warming, the greenhouse gases and their origins
and the current state of knowledge regarding past climates, I move on in
the next chapter to describe how, through computer models of the climate,
predictions can be made about what climate change can be expected in
the future.

Given that the sea level at the end of the last glacial maximum was 120 m
lower than that today, estimate the volume of ice in the ice-sheets that covered
the northern parts of the American and Euroasian continents.
How much energy would be required to melt the volume of ice you have
calculated in question 1? Compare this with the extra summer sunshine
north of latitude 60◦ which might have been available between 18 000 and
6000 years before the present according to the data in Figure 4.5. Does your
answer support the Milankovitch theory?
It is sometimes suggested that the large reserves of fossil fuels on Earth
should be preserved until the onset of the next ice age is closer so that some
of its impact can be postponed. From what you know of the greenhouse effect
and of the behaviour of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the oceans,
consider the inﬂuences that human burning of the known reserves of fossil
fuels – see Figure 11.2 – could have on the onset of the next ice age.

Chapter 5

Modelling the climate

Chapter 2 looked at the greenhouse effect in terms of a simple radiation
balance. That gave an estimate of the rise in the average temperature at
the surface of the Earth as greenhouse gases increase. But any change in
climate will not be distributed uniformly everywhere; the climate system
is much more complicated than that. More detail in climate change prediction requires very much more elaborate calculations using computers.
The problem is so vast that the fastest and largest computers available
are needed. But before computers can be set to work on the calculation,
a model of the climate must be set up for them to use.1 A model of the
weather as used for weather forecasting will be used to explain what is
meant by a numerical model on a computer, followed by a description
of the increase in elaboration required to include all parts of the climate
system in the model.

Modelling the weather
An English mathematician, Lewis Fry Richardson, set up the ﬁrst numerical model of the weather. During his spare moments while working
for the Friends’ Ambulance Unit (he was a Quaker) in France during the
First World War he carried out the ﬁrst numerical weather forecast. With
much painstaking calculation with his slide-rule, he solved the appropriate equations and produced a six-hour forecast. It took him six months –
and then it was not a very good result. But his basic methods, described
in a book published in 1922,2 were correct. To apply his methods to real
forecasts, Richardson imagined the possibility of a very large concert
hall ﬁlled with people, each person carrying out part of the calculation,

forecasting centres. The computers are those used by the UK Meteorological
Ofﬁce for numerical weather prediction research, since 1965 for operational
weather forecasting and most recently for research into climate prediction.
Richardson’s computer refers to his dream of a large ‘human’ computer
mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.

so that the integration of the numerical model could keep up with the
weather. But he was many years before his time! It was not until some
forty years later that, essentially using Richardson’s methods, the ﬁrst
operational weather forecast was produced on an electronic computer.
Computers more than one million times faster than the one used for that
ﬁrst forecast (Figure 5.1) now run the numerical models that are the basis
of all weather forecasts.
Numerical models of the weather and the climate are based on the
fundamental mathematical equations that describe the physics and dynamics of the movements and processes taking place in the atmosphere,
the ocean, the ice and on the land. Although they include empirical
information, they are not based to any large degree on empirical relationships – unlike numerical models of many other systems, for instance
in the social sciences.
Setting up a model of the atmosphere for a weather forecast (see Figure 5.2) requires a mathematical description of the way in which energy
from the Sun enters the atmosphere from above, some being reﬂected
by the surface or by clouds and some being absorbed at the surface or
in the atmosphere (see Figure 2.6). The exchange of energy and water
vapour between the atmosphere and the surface must also be described.

Modelling the weather

79

Figure 5.2 Schematic
illustrating the parameters
and physical processes
involved in atmospheric
models.

Water vapour is important because of its associated latent heat (in
other words, it gives out heat when it condenses) and also because the
condensation of water vapour results in cloud formation, which modiﬁes
substantially the interaction of the atmosphere with the incoming energy
from the Sun. Variations in both these energy inputs modify the atmospheric temperature structure, causing changes in atmospheric density
(since warmed gases expand and are therefore less dense). It is these
density changes that drive atmospheric motions such as winds and air
currents, which in their turn alter and feed back on atmospheric density
and composition. More details of the model formulation are given in the
box below.
To forecast the weather for several days ahead a model covering the
whole globe is required; for example, the southern hemisphere circulation today will affect northern hemisphere weather within a few days and
vica versa. In a global forecasting model, the parameters (i.e. pressure,
temperature, humidity, wind velocity and so on) that are needed to describe the dynamics and physics (listed in the box below) are speciﬁed
at a grid of points (Figure 5.3) covering the globe. A typical spacing
between points in the horizontal would be 100 km and about 1 km in
the vertical; typically there would be twenty levels or so in the model in
the vertical. The ﬁneness of the spacing is limited by the power of the
computers currently available.
Having set up the model, to generate a forecast from the present, it is
started off from the atmosphere’s current state and then the equations are
integrated forward in time (see box below) to provide new descriptions of
the atmospheric circulation and structure up to six or more days ahead.
For a description of the atmosphere’s current state, data from a wide
variety of sources (see box below) have to be brought together and fed
into the model.

80

Modelling the climate

Setting up a numerical atmospheric model
A numerical model of the atmosphere contains descriptions, in appropriate computer form and with necessary approximations, of the basic
dynamics and physics of the different components of the atmosphere and
their interactions.3 When a physical process is described in terms of an
algorithm (a process of step-by-step calculation) and simple parameters
(the quantities that are included in a mathematical equation), the process
is said to have been parameterised.
The dynamical equations are:

r The horizontal momentum equations (Newton’s Second Law of
Motion). In these, the horizontal acceleration of a volume of air
is balanced by the horizontal pressure gradient and the friction.
Because the Earth is rotating, this acceleration includes the Coriolis acceleration. The ‘friction’ in the model mainly arises from
motions smaller than the grid spacing, which have to be parameterised.
r The hydrostatic equation. The pressure at a point is given by the
mass of the atmosphere above that point. Vertical accelerations are
neglected.
r The continuity equation. This ensures conservation of mass.
The model’s physics consists of:

r The equation of state. This connects the quantities of pressure,
volume and temperature for the atmosphere.

r The thermodynamic equation (the law of conservation of energy).
r Parameterisation of moist processes (such as evaporation, condensation, formation and dispersal of clouds).

r Parameterisation of absorption, emission and reﬂection of solar
radiation and of thermal radiation.

r Parameterisation of convective processes.
r Parameterisation of exchange of momentum (in other words, friction), heat and water vapour at the surface.
Most of the equations in the model are differential equations, which
means they describe the way in which quantities such as pressure and
wind velocity change with time and with location. If the rate of change of
a quantity such as wind velocity and its value at a given time are known,
then its value at a later time can be calculated. Constant repetition of
this procedure is called integration. Integration of the equations is the
process whereby new values of all necessary quantities are calculated at
later times, providing the model’s predictive powers.

a model grid. The levels in
the vertical are not equally
spaced; the top level is
typically at about 30 km in
altitude.

Since computer models for weather forecasting were ﬁrst introduced,
their forecast skill has improved to an extent beyond any envisaged by
those involved in the development of the early models. As improvements
have been made in the model formulation, in the accuracy or coverage
of the data used for initialisation (see box above) or in the resolution of
the model (the distance between grid points), the resulting forecast skill
has increased. For instance, for the British Isles, three-day forecasts of
surface pressure today are as skilful on average as two-day forecasts of
ten years ago, as can be seen from Figure 5.5.
When looking at the continued improvement in weather forecasts, the
question obviously arises as to whether the improvement will continue or
whether there is a limit to the predictability we can expect. Because the
atmosphere is a partially chaotic system (see box below), even if perfect
observations of the atmospheric state and circulation could be provided,
there would be a limit to our ability to forecast the detailed state of the
atmosphere at some time in the future. In Figure 5.6 current forecast skill
is compared with the best estimate of the limit of the forecast skill for
the British Isles (similar results would be obtained with any other midlatitude situation) with a perfect model and near perfect data. According
to that estimate, the limit of signiﬁcant future skill is about 20 days
ahead.

82

Modelling the climate

Data to initialise the model
At a major global weather forecasting centre, data
from many sources are collected and fed into
the model. This process is called initialisation.
Figure 5.4 illustrates some of the sources of data
for the forecast beginning at 1200 hours Universal
Time (UT) on 1 July 1990. To ensure the timely

receipt of data from around the world a dedicated communication network has been set up, used
solely for this purpose. Great care needs to be taken
with the methods for assimilation of the data into
the model as well as with the data’s quality and
accuracy.

Figure 5.4 Illustrating some of the sources of data for input into the UK Meteorological Ofﬁce global
weather forecasting model on a typical day. Surface observations are from land observing stations
(manned and unmanned), from ships and from buoys. Radiosonde balloons make observations at up to
30 km altitude from land and from ship-borne stations. Satellite soundings are of temperature and
humidity at different atmospheric levels deduced from observations of infrared or microwave radiation.
Satellite cloud-track winds are derived from observing the motion of clouds in images from geostationary
satellites.

Forecast skill varies considerably between different weather situations or patterns. In other words some situations are more ‘chaotic’ (in
the technical sense in which that word is used – see box below) than
others. One way of identifying the skill that might be achieved in a

north Atlantic and Western Europe since 1966 for 24-h, 48-h and 72-h forecasts.
Note that 1 hPa = 1 mbar.

Figure 5.6 Illustrating potential improvements in forecast skill if there were
better data or a better model. The ordinate (vertical axis) is a measure of the
error of model forecasts (it is the root mean square differences of forecasts of the
500 hPa height ﬁeld compared with analyses). Curve (a) is the error of 1990 UK
Meteorological Ofﬁce forecasts as a function of forecast range. Curve (b) is an
estimate showing how, with the same initial data, the error would be reduced if
a perfect model could be used. Curve (c) is an estimate showing the further
improvement which might be expected if near-perfect data could be provided
for the initial state. After a sufﬁciently long period, all the curves approach a
saturation value of the average root mean square difference between any
forecasts chosen at random.

Weather forecasting and chaos4
The science of chaos has developed rapidly since
the 1960s (when a meteorologist Edward Lorenz
was one of its pioneers) along with the power of
electronic computers. In this context, chaos is a
term with a particular technical meaning. A chaotic
system is one whose behaviour is so highly sensitive to the initial conditions from which it started
that precise future prediction is not possible. Even
quite simple systems can exhibit chaos under some
conditions. For instance, the motion of a simple
pendulum (Figure 5.7) can be ‘chaotic’ under some
circumstances, and, because of its extreme sensitivity to small disturbances, its detailed motion is not
then predictable.
A condition for chaotic behaviour is that the
relationship between the quantities which govern
the motion of the system be non-linear; in other
words, a description of the relationship on a graph
would be a curve rather than a straight line.5 Since
the appropriate relationships for the atmosphere
are non-linear it can be expected to show chaotic
behaviour. This is illustrated in Figure 5.6, which
shows the improvement in predictability that can be
expected if the data describing the initial state are
improved. However, even with virtually perfect initial data, the predictability in terms of days ahead

only moves from about six days to about twenty
days, because the atmosphere is a chaotic system.
For the simple pendulum not all situations are
chaotic. Not surprisingly, therefore, in a system
as complex as the atmosphere, some occasions
are more predictable than others. A good illustration of an occasion with particular sensitivity to
the initial data and to the way in which the data
were assimilated into the model is provided by
the Meteorological Ofﬁce forecasts for the storm
which hit southeast England in the early hours of
Friday, 16 October 1987. During this storm gusts of
over 90 knots (170 km h−1 ) were recorded and approximately ﬁfteen million trees were blown down.
Although as early as the previous Sunday forecasts
had given good early warning of a storm of unusual severity, the model forecasts available during
15 October gave much poorer guidance than earlier
forecasts and failed to predict the intensity or the
correct track of the storm. The question was raised
at the time as to whether the numerical models used
were capable of the accurate prediction of such an
exceptional event. Figure 5.8 shows that, using all
the data which could have been available and better assimilation procedures in the model, a good
forecast of the event can be achieved.

plane, the scale being in centimetres. (b) For a forcing frequency just above f 0 the motion of the bob
settles down to a simple, regular pattern. (c) For a forcing frequency just below f 0 the bob shows
‘chaotic’ motion (although contained within a given region) which varies randomly and discontinuously
as a function of the initial conditions.

given situation is to employ ensemble forecasting in which an ensemble
of forecasts is run from a cluster of initial states that are generated by
adding to an initial state small perturbations that are within the range of
observational or analysis errors. The forecasts provided from the means
of such ensembles show signiﬁcant improvement compared with individual forecasts. Further, ensemble forecasts where the spread amongst
the ensemble is low possess more skill that those where the spread in the
ensemble is comparatively high.

Seasonal forecasting
So far short-term forecasts of detailed weather have been considered.
After twenty days or so they run out of skill. What about further into the

Modelling the climate

future? Although we cannot expect to forecast the weather in detail, is
there any possibility of predicting the average weather, say, a few months
ahead? As this section shows, it is possible for some parts of the world,
because of the inﬂuence of the distribution of ocean surface temperatures
on the atmosphere’s behaviour. For seasonal forecasting it is no longer
the initial state of the atmosphere about which detailed knowledge is
required. Rather, we need to know the conditions at the surface and how
they might be changing.
In the tropics, the atmosphere is particularly sensitive to sea surface
temperature. This is not surprising because the largest contribution to the
heat input to the atmosphere is due to evaporation of water vapour from
the ocean surface and its subsequent condensation in the atmosphere,
releasing its latent heat. Because the saturation water vapour pressure
increases rapidly with temperature – at higher temperatures more water
can be evaporated before the atmosphere is saturated – evaporation from
the surface and hence the heat input to the atmosphere is particularly
large in the tropics.
It is during El Ni˜no events in the east tropical Paciﬁc (see Figure 5.9)
that the largest variations are found in ocean temperature. Anomalies in
the circulation and rainfall in all tropical regions and to a lesser extent at

Anomoly (standardised units)

The Sahel region of Africa forms a band about
500 km wide along the southern edge of the Sahara
Desert that gets most of its rainfall during northern
hemisphere summer (particularly July to September). This region is known for its prolonged periods
of drought, which can have a devastating impact on
the local economy, an example of which occurred
in the 1970s and 1980s (Figure 5.10). The droughts
have been linked to ﬂuctuations in several patterns
of sea surface temperature (SST). Figure 5.11 illus-

trates the difference in pattern of the mean worldwide SST between the ﬁve wettest and ﬁve driest
Sahel years since 1901. This and other patterns form
the basis of the statistical and atmosphere global
circulation model seasonal forecasts that have been
made by the UK Meteorological Ofﬁce for the Sahel
since 1986.8 Long-lead forecasts are made in May
for the July–September rainfall season and updated
in early July.

A common difﬁculty with the forecasts has been
that changes in the SST patterns occur between the
time of the forecast and the main rainfall season. To
overcome this problem, an atmosphere–ocean coupled model (see ‘The climate system’, next section)
is being used to forecast changes in SST in addition to changes in atmospheric circulation. Forecast skill has improved although remaining modest

(correlation between observed and modelled mean
rainfall is about 0.37), in particular major changes
to drier conditions are being picked up.9 Such models, additionally coupled to variations in the characteristics of land surface vegetation and soil which
have also been shown to be important,10 provide the
greatest promise for seasonal forecasts in the Sahel
and in many other regions of the world.

Modelling the climate

mid latitudes are associated with these El Ni˜no events (see Figure 1.4).
A good test of the atmospheric models described above is to run them
with an El Ni˜no sequence of sea surface temperatures and see whether
they are able to simulate these climate anomalies. This has now been
done with a number of different atmospheric models; they have shown
considerable skill in the simulation of many of the observed anomalies,
especially those in the tropics and sub-tropics.6
Because of the large heat capacity of the oceans, anomalies of ocean
surface temperature tend to persist for some months. The possibility
therefore exists, for regions where there is a strong correlation between
weather and patterns of ocean surface temperature, of making forecasts
of climate (or average weather) some weeks or months in advance. Such
seasonal forecasts have been attempted especially for regions with low
rainfall; for instance, for north east Brazil and for the Sahel region of
sub-Saharan Africa, a region where human survival is very dependent
on the marginal rainfall (see box below).
The ability to make accurate seasonal forecasts signiﬁcantly in advance depends critically on being able to forecast changes in ocean
surface temperature. To do that requires understanding of, and the ability to model, the ocean circulation and the way it is coupled to the
atmospheric circulation. Because the largest changes in ocean surface
temperature occur in the tropics and because there are reasons to suppose
that the ocean may be more predictable in the tropics than elsewhere,
most emphasis on the prediction of ocean surface temperature has been
placed in tropical regions, in particular on the prediction of the El Ni˜no
events themselves (see box below).
Later on in this chapter the coupling of atmospheric models and
ocean models is described. For the moment it will sufﬁce to say that, using
coupled models together with detailed observations of both atmosphere
and ocean in the Paciﬁc region, signiﬁcant skill in the prediction of
El Ni˜no events up to a year in advance has been achieved7 (see also
Chapter 7).

The climate system
So far the forecasting of detailed weather over a few days and of average
weather for a month or so, up to perhaps a season ahead, has been described in order to introduce the science and technology of modelling,
and also because some of the scientiﬁc conﬁdence in the more elaborate climate models arises from their ability to describe and forecast the
processes involved in day-to-day weather.
Climate is concerned with substantially longer periods of time, from
a few years to perhaps a decade or longer. A description of the climate

The climate system

89

A simple model of the El Ni˜
no
El Ni˜no events are good examples of the strong
coupling which occurs between the circulations of
ocean and atmosphere. The stress exerted by atmospheric circulation – the wind – on the ocean surface
is a main driver for the ocean circulation. Also, as
we have seen, the heat input to the atmosphere from
the ocean, especially that arising from evaporation,
has a big inﬂuence on the atmospheric circulation.
A simple model of an El Ni˜no event that shows
the effect of different kinds of wave motions that
can propagate within the ocean is illustrated in Figure 5.12. In this model a wave in the ocean, known
as a Rossby wave, propagates westwards from a
warm anomaly in ocean surface temperature near
the equator. When it reaches the ocean’s western

boundary it is reﬂected as a different sort of wave,
known as a Kelvin wave, which travels eastward.
This Kelvin wave cancels and reverses the sign of
the original warm anomaly, so triggering a cold
event. The time taken for this half-cycle of the whole
El Ni˜no process is determined by the speed with
which the waves propagate in the ocean; it takes
about two years. It is essentially driven by ocean dynamics, the associated atmospheric changes being
determined by the patterns of ocean surface temperature (and in turn reinforcing those patterns) which
result from the ocean dynamics. Expressed in terms
of this simple model, some of the characteristics of
the El Ni˜no process appear to be essentially predictable.

over a period involves the averages of appropriate components of the
weather (for example, temperature and rainfall) over that period together
with the statistical variations of those components. In considering the
effect of human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, changes in
climate over periods of decades up to a century or two ahead must be
predicted .

90

Figure 5.13 Schematic of
the climate system.

Modelling the climate

Since we live in the atmosphere the variables commonly used to
describe climate are mainly concerned with the atmosphere. But climate cannot be described in terms of atmosphere alone. Atmospheric
processes are strongly coupled to the oceans (see above); they are also
coupled to the land surface. There is also strong coupling to those parts
of the Earth covered with ice (the cryosphere) and to the vegetation and
other living systems on the land and in the ocean (the biosphere). These
ﬁve components – atmosphere, ocean, land, ice and biosphere – together
make up the climate system (Figure 5.13).

Feedbacks in the climate system
Chapter 2 considered the rise in global average temperature which would
result from the doubling of the concentration of atmospheric carbon
dioxide assuming that no other changes occurred apart from the increased
temperature at the surface and in the lower atmosphere. The rise in
temperature was found to be 1.2 ◦ C. However, it was also established that,
because of feedbacks (which may be positive or negative) associated with
the temperature increase, the actual rise in global average temperature
was likely to be approximately doubled to about 2.5 ◦ C. This section lists
the most important of these feedbacks.

Feedbacks in the climate system

Figure 5.14 Schematic of the physical processes associated with clouds.

Water vapour feedback
This is the most important.11 With a warmer atmosphere more evaporation occurs from the ocean and from wet land surfaces. On average,
therefore, a warmer atmosphere will be a wetter one; it will possess a
higher water vapour content. Since water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas, on average a positive feedback results of a magnitude that
models estimate to approximately double the increase in the global
average temperature that would arise with ﬁxed water vapour.12

Cloud-radiation feedback
This is more complicated as several processes are involved. Clouds interfere with the transfer of radiation in the atmosphere in two ways
(Figure 5.14). Firstly, they reﬂect a certain proportion of solar radiation back to space, so reducing the total energy available to the system. Secondly, they act as blankets to thermal radiation from the Earth’s
surface in a similar way to greenhouse gases. By absorbing thermal
radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface below, and by themselves
emitting thermal radiation, they act to reduce the heat loss to space by the
surface.
The effect that dominates for any particular cloud depends on the
cloud temperature (and hence on the cloud height) and on its detailed
optical properties (those properties which determine its reﬂectivity to
solar radiation and its interaction with thermal radiation). The latter
depend on whether the cloud is of water or ice, on its liquid or solid

91

92

Modelling the climate

Cloud radiative forcing
A concept helpful in distinguishing between the two effects of clouds
mentioned in the text is that of cloud radiative forcing. Take the radiation leaving the top of the atmosphere above a cloud; suppose it has
a value R. Now imagine the cloud to be removed, leaving everything
else the same; suppose the radiation leaving the top of the atmosphere
is now R  . The difference R  –R is the cloud radiative forcing. It can be
separated into solar radiation and thermal radiation. Values of the cloud
radiative forcing deduced from satellite observations are illustrated in
Figure 5.15. On average, it is found that clouds tend slightly to cool the
Earth-atmosphere system.

Figure 5.15 The cloud radiative forcing is made up of a solar radiation
and a thermal radiation component, which generally act in opposite
senses, each typically of magnitude between 50 and 100 W.m−2 . The
average net forcing is shown here for the period January to July as a
function of latitude as observed from satellites in two years (1985–6) of
the Earth Radiative Budget Experiment (ERBE) and also as simulated in a
climate model with different schemes of cloud formulation (a simple
threshold relative humidity scheme (RH); a scheme that includes cloud
water as a separate variable (CW); as CW but also with cloud radiative
properties dependent on the cloud water content – thick clouds with a
large water content are more reﬂective than thin clouds (CWRP)).There
is encouraging agreement between the models’ results and
observations, but also differences that need to be understood. It is
through comparisons of this kind that further elucidation of cloud
radiation feedback will be achieved.

water content (how thick or thin it is) and on the average size of the cloud
particles. In general for low clouds the reﬂectivity effect wins so they
tend to cool the Earth-atmosphere system; for high clouds, by contrast,
the blanketing effect is dominant and they tend to warm the system. The
overall feedback effect of clouds, therefore, can be either positive or
negative (see box below).
Climate is very sensitive to possible changes in cloud amount or
structure, as can be seen from the results of models discussed in later
chapters. To illustrate this, Table 5.1 shows that the hypothetical effect
on the climate of a small percentage change in cloud cover is comparable
with the expected changes due to a doubling of the carbon dioxide concentration.

Ocean-circulation feedback
The oceans play a large part in determining the existing climate of the
Earth; they are likely therefore to have an important inﬂuence on climate
change due to human activities.

Modelling the climate

Figure 5.16 Estimates of transport of heat by the oceans. Units are terawatts
(1012 W or million million watts). Note the linkages between the oceans and
that some of the heat transported by the north Atlantic originates in the Paciﬁc.

The oceans act on the climate in four important ways. Firstly, there are
close interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere; they behave
as a strongly coupled system. As we have already noted, evaporation
from the oceans provides the main source of atmospheric water vapour
which, through its latent heat of condensation in clouds, provides the
largest single heat source for the atmosphere. The atmosphere in its turn
acts through wind stress on the ocean surface as the main driver of the
ocean circulation.
Secondly, they possess a large heat capacity compared with the atmosphere, in other words a large quantity of heat is needed to raise the
temperature of the oceans only slightly. In comparison, the entire heat
capacity of the atmosphere is equivalent to less than three metres depth
of water. That means that in a world that is warming, the oceans warm
much more slowly than the atmosphere. We experience this effect of the
oceans as they tend to reduce the extremes of atmospheric temperature.
For instance, the range of temperature change both during the day and
seasonally is much less at places near the coast than at places far inland. The oceans therefore exert a dominant control on the rate at which
atmospheric changes occur.
Thirdly, through their internal circulation the oceans redistribute heat
throughout the climate system. The total amount of heat transported
from the equator to the polar regions by the oceans is similar to that

Models for climate prediction

transported by the atmosphere. However, the regional distribution of
that transport is very different (Figure 5.16). Even small changes in the
regional heat transport by the oceans could have large implications for
climate change. For instance, the amount of heat transported by the north
Atlantic Ocean is over 1000 terawatts (1 terawatt = 1 million million
watts = 1012 watts). To give an idea of how large this is, we can note
that a large power station puts out about 1000 million (109 ) watts and the
total amount of commercial energy produced globally is about twelve
terawatts. To put it further in context, considering the region of the north
Atlantic Ocean between north west Europe and Iceland, the heat input
(Figure 5.16) carried by the ocean circulation is of similar magnitude to
that reaching the ocean surface there from the incident solar radiation.
Any accurate simulation of likely climate change, therefore, especially
of its regional variations, must include a description of ocean structure
and dynamics.

Ice-albedo feedback
An ice or snow surface is a powerful reﬂector of solar radiation (the
albedo is a measure of its reﬂectivity). As some ice melts, therefore, at
the warmer surface, solar radiation which had previously been reﬂected
back to space by the ice or snow is absorbed, leading to further increased
warming. This is another positive feedback which on its own would increase the global average temperature rise due to doubled carbon dioxide
by about twenty per cent.
Four feedbacks have been identiﬁed, all of which play a large part
in the determination of climate, especially its regional distribution. It is
therefore necessary to introduce them into climate models. Because the
global models allow for regional variation and also include the important
non-linear processes in their formulation, they are able in principle to
provide a full description of the effect of these feedbacks. They are,
in fact, the only tools available with this potential capability. It is to a
description of climate prediction models that we now turn.

Models for climate prediction
For models to be successful they need to include an adequate description
of the feedbacks we have listed. The water vapour feedback and its
regional distribution depend on the detailed processes of evaporation,
condensation and advection (the transfer of heat by horizontal air ﬂow) of
water vapour, and on the way in which convection processes (responsible

95

96

Modelling the climate

for showers and thunderstorms) are affected by higher surface temperatures. All these processes are already well included in weather
forecasting models, and water vapour feedback has been very thoroughly
studied.13 The most important of the others are cloud radiation feedback
and ocean-circulation feedback. How are these incorporated into the
models?
For modelling purposes, clouds divide into two types – layer clouds
present on scales larger than the grid size and convective clouds generally
on smaller scales than a grid box. For the introduction of layer clouds,
early weather-forecasting and climate models employed comparatively
simple schemes. A typical scheme would generate cloud at speciﬁed
levels whenever the relative humidity exceeded a critical value, chosen
for broad agreement between model-generated cloud cover and that observed from climatological records. More recent models parameterise the
processes of condensation, freezing, precipitation and cloud formation
much more completely. They also take into account detailed cloud properties (e.g. water droplets or ice crystals and droplet number and size)
that enable their radiative properties (e.g. their reﬂectivity and transmissivity) to be speciﬁed sufﬁciently well for the inﬂuence of clouds on the
atmosphere’s overall energy budget to be properly described. The most
sophisticated models also include allowance for the effect of aerosols
on cloud properties – denoted the indirect aerosol effect in Figure 3.8.
The effects of convective clouds are incorporated as part of the model’s
scheme for the parametrisation of convection.
The amount and sign (positive or negative) of the average cloudradiation feedback in a particular climate model is dependent on many
aspects of the model’s formulation as well as on the particular scheme
used for the description of cloud formation. Different climate models,
therefore, can show average cloud-radiation feedback that can be either
positive or negative; further, the feedback can show substantial regional
variation. For instance, models differ in their treatment of low cloud such
that in some models the amount of low cloud increases with increased
greenhouse gases, with other models it decreases. Uncertainty regarding
cloud-radiation feedback is the main reason for the wide uncertainty
range in what is called climate sensitivity (see Chapter 6) or the change
in global average surface temperature due a doubling of carbon dioxide
concentration.
The second important feedback is that due to the effects of the ocean
circulation. Compared with a global atmospheric model for weather forecasting, the most important elaboration of a climate model is the inclusion of the effects of the ocean. Early climate models only included the
ocean very crudely; they represented it by a simple slab some ﬁfty or
one hundred metres deep, the approximate depth of the ‘mixed layer’ of

Models for climate prediction

interface.

ocean which responds to the seasonal heating and cooling at the Earth’s
surface. In such models, adjustments had to be made to allow for the
transport of heat by ocean currents. When running the model with a perturbation such as increased carbon dioxide, it was not possible to make
allowance for any changes in that transport which might occur. Such
models therefore possess severe limitations.
For an adequate description of the inﬂuence of the ocean it is necessary to model the ocean circulation and its coupling to the atmospheric
circulation. Figure 5.17 shows the ingredients of such a model. For the
atmospheric part of the model, in order to accommodate long runs on
available computers, the size of the grid has to be substantially larger,
typically 300 km in the horizontal. Otherwise it is essentially the same
as the global model for weather forecasting described earlier. The formulation of the dynamics and physics of the ocean part of the model
is similar to that of its atmospheric counterpart. The effects of water
vapour are of course peculiar to the atmosphere, but the salinity (the
salt content) of the oceans has to be included as a parameter together
with its considerable effects on the water density. Because dynamical
systems, e.g. largescale eddies in the oceans, are of smaller scale than
their atmospheric counterparts, the grid size of the ocean component is
typically about half that of the atmospheric component. On the other
hand, because changes in the ocean are slower, the time step for model
integration can be greater for the ocean component.
At the ocean–atmosphere interface there is exchange of heat, water
and momentum (exchange of momentum leads to friction) between the
two ﬂuids. The importance of water in the atmosphere and its inﬂuence on
the atmospheric circulation have already been shown. The distribution
of fresh water precipitated from the atmosphere as rain or snow also
has a large inﬂuence on the ocean’s circulation through its effect on the

98

Modelling the climate

distribution of salt in the ocean, which in turn affects the ocean density.
It is not surprising, therefore, to ﬁnd that the ‘climate’ described by the
model is quite sensitive to the size and the distribution of water exchanges
at the interface.
Before the model can be used for prediction it has to be run for a
considerable time until it reaches a steady ‘climate’. The ‘climate’ of the
model, when it is run unperturbed by increasing greenhouse gases, should
be as close as possible to the current actual climate. If the exchanges are
not correctly described, this will not be the case. Getting the exchanges
right in the model has proved to be difﬁcult. Until recently, many coupled
models introduced artiﬁcial adjustments to the ﬂuxes (known as ﬂux adjustments) so as to ensure that the model’s ‘climate’ is as identical as
possible to the current climate. However, the ocean component of the
model has been improved especially through introducing higher resolution (150 km or less), so the need for such adjustments has diminished
and many models are now able to provide an adequate description of the
climate with no such adjustments.
Before leaving the oceans, there is a particular feedback which
should be mentioned between the hydrological cycle and the deep ocean
circulation (see box below). Changes in rainfall, by altering the ocean
salinity, can interact with the ocean circulation. This could affect the
climate, particularly of the North Atlantic region; it may also have
been responsible for some dramatic climate changes in the past (see
Chapter 4).
The most important feedbacks belong to the atmospheric and the
ocean components of the model. They are the largest components, and,
because they are both ﬂuids and have to be dynamically coupled together,
their incorporation into the model is highly demanding. However, another
feedback to be modelled is the ice-albedo feedback, which arises from
the variations of sea-ice and of snow.
Sea-ice covers a large part of the polar regions in the winter. It is
moved about by both the surface wind and the ocean circulation. So that
the ice-albedo feedback can be properly described, the growth, decay and
dynamics of sea-ice have to be included in the model. Land ice is also
included, essentially as a boundary condition – a ﬁxed quantity – because
its coverage changes little from year to year. However, the model needs to
show whether there are likely to be changes in ice volume, even though
these are small, in order to ﬁnd out their effect on sea level (Chapter 7
considers the impacts of sea-level change).
Interactions with the land surface must also be adequately described.
The most important properties for the model are land surface wetness or,
more precisely, soil moisture content (which will determine the amount

Models for climate prediction

99

The ocean’s deep circulation
For climate change over periods up to a decade, only
the upper layers of the ocean have any substantial
interaction with the atmosphere. For longer periods,
however, links with the deep ocean circulation become important. The effects of changes in the deep
circulation are of particular importance
Experiments using chemical tracers, for instance those illustrated in Figure 5.20 (see next
box), have been helpful in indicating the regions
where strong coupling to the deep ocean occurs. To
sink to the deep ocean, water needs to be particularly dense, in other words both cold and salty.
There are two main regions where such dense
water sinks down to the deep ocean, namely in the
north Atlantic Ocean (in the Greenland sea between
Scandinavia and Greenland and the Labrador sea

west of Greenland) and in the region of Antarctica.
Salt-laden deep water formed in this way contributes to a deep ocean circulation that involves
all the oceans (Figure 5.18) and is known as the
thermohaline circulation (THC).
In Chapter 4 we mentioned the link between
the THC and the melting of ice. Increases in the ice
melt can lead to the ocean surface water becoming
less salty and therefore less dense. It will not sink so
readily, the deep water formation will be inhibited
and the THC is weakened. In Chapter 6, the link between the THC and the hydrological (water) cycle
in the atmosphere is mentioned. Increased precipitation in the north Atlantic region, for instance, can
lead to a weakening of the THC.

of evaporation) and albedo (reﬂectivity to solar radiation). The models
keep track of the changes in soil moisture through evaporation and precipitation. The albedo depends on soil type, vegetation, snow cover and
surface wetness.

Validation of the model
In discussing various aspects of modelling we have already indicated
how some validation of the components of climate models may be carried
out. The successful predictions of weather-forecasting models provide
validation of important aspects of the atmospheric component, as do
the simulations mentioned earlier in the chapter of the connections between sea surface temperature anomalies and precipitation patterns in
some parts of the world. Various tests have also been carried out of the
ocean component of climate models; for instance, through comparisons
between the simulation and observation of the movement of chemical
tracers (see box below).
Once a comprehensive climate model has been formulated it can be
tested in three main ways. Firstly, it can be run for a number of years
of simulated time and the climate generated by the model compared in
detail to the current climate. For the model to be seen as a valid one, the
average distribution and the seasonal variations of appropriate parameters such as surface pressure, temperature and rainfall have to compare
well with observation. In the same way, the variability of the model’s
climate must be similar to the observed variability. Climate models that
are currently employed for climate prediction stand up well to such
comparisons.14
Secondly, models can be compared against simulations of past climates when the distribution of key variables was substantially different
than at present; for example, the period around 9000 years ago when
the conﬁguration of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun was different (see
Figure 5.19). The perihelion (minimum Earth–Sun distance) was in July
rather than in January as it is now; also the tilt of the Earth’s axis was
slightly different from its current value (24◦ rather than 23.5◦ ). Resulting from these orbital differences (see Chapter 4), there were signiﬁcant
differences in the distribution of solar radiation throughout the year.
The incoming solar energy when averaged over the northern hemisphere
was about seven per cent greater in July and correspondingly less in
January.
When these altered parameters are incorporated into a model, a different climate results. For instance, northern continents are warmer in
summer and colder in winter. In summer a signiﬁcantly expanded low

pressure region develops over north Africa and south Asia because of
the increased land–ocean temperature contrast. The summer monsoons
in these regions are strengthened and there is increased rainfall. These
simulated changes are in qualitative agreement with paleoclimate data;
for example, these data provide evidence for that period (around 9000
years ago) of lakes and vegetation in the southern Sahara about 1000 km
north of the present limits of vegetation.
The accuracy and the coverage of data available for these past periods are limited. However, the model simulations for 9000 years ago,
described above, and those for other periods in the past have demonstrated the value of such studies in the validation of climate models.
A third way in which models can be validated is to use them to predict
the effect of large perturbations on the climate. Good progress is being
achieved with the prediction of El Ni˜no events and the associated climate
anomalies up to a year ahead (see earlier in the chapter). Other short-term
perturbations are due to volcanic eruptions, the effects of which were
mentioned in Chapter 1. Several climate models have been run in which
the amount of incoming solar radiation has been modiﬁed to allow for the
effect of the volcanic dust from Mount Pinatubo, which erupted in 1991
(Figure 5.21). Successful simulation of some of the regional anomalies
of climate which followed that eruption, for instance the unusually cold
winters in the Middle East and the mild winters in western Europe, has
also been achieved by the models.15

101

102

Modelling the climate

Modelling of tracers in the ocean
A test that assists in validating the ocean component of the model is to compare the distribution of a
chemical tracer as observed and as simulated by the
model. In the 1950s radioactive tritium (an isotope
of hydrogen) released in the major atomic bomb
tests entered the oceans and was distributed by the
ocean circulation and by mixing. Figure 5.20 shows
good agreement between the observed distribution

of tritium (in tritium units) in a section of the western north Atlantic Ocean about a decade after the
major bomb tests and the distribution as simulated
by a twelve-level ocean model. Similar comparisons
have been made more recently of the measured uptake of one of the freons CFC-11, whose emissions
into the atmosphere have increased rapidly since the
1950s, compared with the modelled uptake.

Figure 5.20 The tritium distribution in a section of the western north Atlantic Ocean approximately one
decade after the major atomic bomb tests, as observed in the GEOSECS programme (a) and as
modelled (b).

In these three ways, which cover a range of timescales, conﬁdence
has been built in the ability of models to predict climate change due to
human activities.

Comparison with observations
More than ﬁfteen centres in the world located in ten countries are currently running climate models of the kind we have described in which the
circulations of the atmosphere and the ocean are fully coupled together.
Some of these models have been employed to simulate the climate of the
last 150 years allowing for variations in aspects of natural forcing (e.g.
solar variations and volcanoes) and the increases in the concentrations
of greenhouse gases and aerosols.

An example of such simulations is shown in Figure 5.22, where the
observed record of global average surface air temperature is compared
with model simulations taking into account in turn natural forcings, anthropogenic forcings (i.e. the increase in greenhouse gases and aerosols)
and the combination of natural and anthropogenic forcings. Although
the simulations in Figure 5.22 are based on one model, similar results
have been obtained from many models.
Three interesting features of Figure 5.22 can be noted. Firstly, that the
inclusion of anthropogenic forcings provides a plausible explanation for
a substantial part of the observed temperature changes over the last century (especially for the latter part of the century), but that the best match
with observations occurs when both natural and anthropogenic factors
are included. In particular it is likely that changes in solar output and
the comparative absence of volcanic activity were important variations
in natural forcing factors during the ﬁrst part of the twentieth century.
Secondly, the model simulations show variability up to a tenth of a degree
Celsius or more over periods of a few years up to decades. This variability is due to internal exchanges in the model between different parts of
the climate system, and is not dissimilar to that which appears in the observed record. Thirdly, due to the slowing effect of the oceans on climate
change, the warming observed or modelled so far is less than would be
expected if the climate system were in equilibrium under the amount
of radiative forcing due to the current increase in greenhouse gases and
aerosols.
There remains, however, a large amount of natural variability in both
the observations and the simulations and much debate has taken place
over the last decade or more about the strength of the evidence that
global warming due to the increase in greenhouse gases has actually

been observed in the climate record. In other words has the ‘signal’ that
can be attributed to global warming risen sufﬁciently above the ‘noise’
of natural variability? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) has been much involved in this debate.
The IPCC’s ﬁrst Report published in 199016 made a carefully worded
statement to the effect that, although the size of the observed warming
is broadly consistent with the predictions of climate models, it is also of
similar magnitude to natural climate variability. An unequivocal statement that anthropogenic climate change had been detected could not
therefore be made at that time. By 1995 more evidence was available
and the IPCC 1995 Report17 therefore reached the cautious conclusion
as follows.

Comparison with observations

105

Our ability to quantify the human inﬂuence on global climate is currently
limited because the expected signal is still emerging from the noise of
natural climate variability, and because there are uncertainties in key
factors. These include the magnitude and patterns of long term natural
variability and the time-evolving pattern of forcing by, and response to,
changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and land
surface changes. Nevertheless, the balance of evidence suggests a
discernible inﬂuence on global climate.

Since 1995 a large number of studies have addressed the problems of
detection and attribution18 of climate change. Better estimates of natural
variability have been made, especially using models, and the conclusion
reached that the warming over the last one hundred years is very unlikely to be due to natural variability alone.19 In addition to studies using
globally averaged parameters, there have been detailed statistical studies
using pattern correlations based on optimum detection techniques applied to both model results and observations. For example, Figure 5.23
shows a comparison between simulated and observed estimates of zonal
mean temperature change as a function of altitude. Taking these studies

Modelling the climate

into account, the conclusion reached in the IPCC 2001 Report20 is as
follows.
In the light of new evidence and taking into account the remaining
uncertainties, most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely
to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.

Conﬁdence having been established in climate models in the ways we
have outlined in the last two sections, these models can now be used
to generate projections of the likely climate change in the future due
to human activities. Details of such projections will be presented in the
next chapter.
Before leaving comparison with observations, I should mention
some recent work relating to the warming of the ocean that adds further conﬁrmation to the picture that has been presented. In Chapter 2,
the effect of an increase of greenhouse gases was expressed in terms
of radiative forcing or, in other words, a net input of heat energy into
the earth-atmosphere system. Most of this extra energy is stored in the
ocean. The amount of this extra energy has been estimated from measurements of the temperature increase in the ocean at different locations and
depths down to 3 km. From 1957 to 1994 the estimate is (19 ± 9) × 1022
joules, the uncertainty relating mostly to inadequate sampling of some
large ocean areas.21 This amount is a little over 0.5% of the solar energy
received by the Earth over this period. Within the limits of uncertainty, it
agrees well with the estimates of radiative forcing presented earlier and
also with model estimates of ocean heat uptake.22

Is the climate chaotic?
Throughout this chapter the implicit assumption has been made that
climate change is predictable and that models can be used to provide predictions of climate change due to human activities. Before
leaving this chapter I want to consider whether this assumption is
justiﬁed.
The capability of the models themselves has been demonstrated so
far as weather forecasting is concerned. They also possess some skill in
seasonal forecasting. They can provide a good description of the current
climate and its seasonal variations. Further, they provide predictions
which on the whole are reproducible and which are reasonably consistent
between different models. But, it might be argued, this consistency could
be a property of the models rather than of the climate. Is there any other
evidence to support the view that the climate is predictable?

Regional climate modelling

A good place to look for further evidence is in the record of climates of the past, presented in Chapter 4. Correlation between the
Milankovitch cycles in the Earth’s orbital parameters and the cycles
of climate change over the past half million years (see Figures 4.4 and
5.19) provides strong evidence to substantiate the Earth’s orbital variations as the main factor responsible for the triggering of climate change.
The nature of the feedbacks which control the very different amplitudes
of response to the three orbital variations still need to be understood.
Some 60 ± 10% of the variance in the record of global average temperature from paleontological sources over the past million years occurs
close to frequencies identiﬁed in the Milankovitch theory. The existence of this surprising amount of regularity suggests that the climate
system is not strongly chaotic so far as these large changes are concerned, but responds in a largely predictable way to the Milankovitch
forcing.
This Milankovitch forcing arises from changes in the distribution
of solar radiation over the Earth because of variations in the Earth’s
orbit. Changes in climate as a result of the increase of greenhouse gases
are also driven by changes in the radiative regime at the top of the
atmosphere. These changes are not dissimilar in kind (although different
in distribution) from the changes that provide the Milankovitch forcing.
It can be argued therefore that the increases in greenhouse gases will
also result in a largely predictable response.

Regional climate modelling
The simulations we have so far described in this chapter are with global
circulation models (GCM) that typically possess a horizontal resolution (grid size) of around 300 km – the size being limited primarily by
the availability of computer power. Weather and climate on scales large
compared with the grid size are described reasonably well. However, at
scales comparable with the grid size, described as the regional scale,23
the results from global models possess serious limitations. The effects
of forcings and circulations that exist on the regional scale need to be
properly represented. For instance, patterns of precipitation depend critically on the major variations in orography and surface characteristics
that occur on this scale (see Figure 5.24). Patterns generated by a global
model therefore will be a poor representation of what actually occurs on
the regional scale.
To overcome these limitations regional modelling techniques have
been developed.24 That most readily applicable to climate simulation
and prediction is the Regional Climate Model (RCM). A model covering
an appropriate region at a horizontal resolution of say 25 or 50 km can

be ‘nested’ in a global model. The global model provides information
about the response of the global circulation to large-scale forcings and
the evolution of boundary information for the RCM. Within the region,
physical information, for instance concerning forcings, is entered on the
scale of the regional grid and the evolution of the detailed circulation
is developed within the RCM. The RCM is able to account for forcings
on smaller scales than are included in the GCM (e.g. due to topography
or land cover inhomogeneity, see Figure 5.24) and can also simulate
atmospheric circulations and climate variables on these smaller scales.

The future of climate modelling

A limitation of the regional modelling technique we have described
is that, although the global model provides the boundary inputs for the
RCM, the RCM provides no interaction back on to the global model. As
larger computers become available it will be possible to run global models at substantially increased resolution so that this limitation becomes
less serious; at the same time RCMs will acquire an ability to deal with
detail on even smaller scales. Some examples of regional model simulations are given in Chapter 6 (Figure 6.10).
Another technique is that of Statistical Downscaling that has been
widely employed in weather forecasting. This uses statistical methods to
relate large scale climate variables (or ‘predictors’) to regional or local
variables. The predictors from a global circulation climate model can
be fed into the statistical model to estimate the corresponding regional
climate characteristics. The advantage of this technique is that it can
easily be applied. Its disadvantage from the point of view of simulating
climate change is that it is not possible to be sure how far the statistical
relations apply to a climate-changed situation.

The future of climate modelling
Very little has been said in this chapter about the biosphere. Chapter 3 referred to comparatively simple models of the carbon cycle which include
chemical and biological processes and simple non-interactive descriptions of atmospheric processes and ocean transport. The large threedimensional global circulation climate models described in this chapter
contain a lot of dynamics and physics but no interactive chemistry or
biology. As the power of computers increases, global dynamical and
physical circulation models that couple in the biological and chemical
processes that make up the carbon cycle and the chemistry of other gases
are now being developed. Before very long we can expect that models
will be available that are fully interactive and comprehensive in their
inclusion of dynamical, physical, chemical and biological processes in
the atmosphere, the ocean and on the land.
Climate modelling continues to be a rapidly growing science. Although useful attempts at simple climate models were made with early
computers it is only during the last ten years or so that computers have
been powerful enough for coupled atmosphere–ocean models to be employed for climate prediction and that their results have been sufﬁciently
comprehensive and credible for them to be taken seriously by policy
makers. The climate models which have been developed are probably
the most elaborate and sophisticated of computer models developed in
any area of natural science. Further, climate models that describe the
natural science of climate are now being coupled with socio-economic

information in integrated assessment models (see box in Chapter 9,
page 237).
As the power of computers increases it becomes more possible to investigate the sensitivity of models by running a variety of
ensembles that include different initial conditions, model parameterisations and formulations. A particularly interesting project25 involves
thousands of computer users around the world in running state-of-theart climate prediction models on their home, school or work computers.
By collating data from thousands of models it will generate the world’s
largest climate modelling prediction experiment.
A great deal remains to be done to narrow the uncertainty of model
predictions. The ﬁrst priorities must be to improve the modelling of
clouds and the description in the models of the ocean–atmosphere interaction. Larger and faster computers are required to tackle this problem,
especially to enable the resolution of the model grid to be increased, as
well as more sophisticated model physics and dynamics. Much more
thorough observations of all components of the climate system are also
necessary, so that more accurate validation of the model formulations can
be achieved. Further, regional climate modelling techniques will develop
rapidly as they are applied to a wide variety of situations. Very substantial national and international programmes are underway to address all
these issues.

occurs because, associated with changes of temperature and water vapour
content in the troposphere, are changes in the average lapse rate (the rate of
fall of temperature with height). Such changes lead to this further feedback,
which is generally much smaller in magnitude than water vapour feedback
but of the opposite sign, i.e. negative instead of positive. Frequently, when
overall values for water vapour feedback are quoted the lapse rate feedback
has been included. For more details see Houghton, The Physics of Atmospheres.

Chapter 6

Climate change in the twenty-ﬁrst
century and beyond

The last chapter showed that the most effective tool we possess for the
prediction of future climate change due to human activities is the climate
model. This chapter will describe the predictions of models for likely
climate change during the twenty-ﬁrst century. It will also consider other
factors that might lead to climate change and assess their importance
relative to the effect of greenhouse gases.

Emission scenarios
A principal reason for the development of climate models is to learn
about the detail of the likely climate change this century and beyond.
Because model simulations into the future depend on assumptions regarding future anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, which in
turn depend on assumptions about many factors involving human behaviour, it has been thought inappropriate and possibly misleading to
call the simulations of future climate so far ahead ‘predictions’. They
are therefore generally called ‘projections’ to emphasise that what is being done is to explore likely future climates which arise from a range of
assumptions regarding human activities.
A starting point for any projections of likely climate change into the
future is a set of descriptions of likely future global emissions of greenhouse gases. These will depend on a variety of assumptions regarding
human behaviour and activities, including population, economic growth,
energy use and the sources of energy generation. As was mentioned in
Chapter 3, such descriptions of future emissions are called scenarios.

A wide range of scenarios was developed by the IPCC in a Special Report
on Emission Scenarios (SRES)1 in preparation for its 2001 Report (see
box below). It is these scenarios that have been used in developing the
projections of future climate presented in this chapter. In addition, because it has been widely used in modelling studies, results are also presented using a scenario (IS 92a) taken from a set developed by the IPCC
in 1992 and widely described as representative of ‘business-as-usual’.2
Details of these scenarios are presented in Figure 6.1.
The SRES scenarios include estimates of greenhouse gas emissions
resulting from all sources including land-use change. Estimates in the
different scenarios begin from the current values for land-use change including deforestation (see Table 3.1). Assumptions in different scenarios
vary, from continued deforestation, although reducing as less forest remains available for clearance, to substantial afforestation leading to an
increased carbon sink.

Emission scenarios

117

The emission scenarios of the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES)
The SRES scenarios are based on a set of four different story lines within each of which a family of
scenarios has been developed – leading to a total of
thirty-ﬁve scenarios.3

A1 Storyline
The A1 storyline and scenario family describes
a future world of very rapid economic growth, a
global population that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new
and more efﬁcient technologies. Major underlying
themes are convergence among regions, capacity
building and increased cultural and social interactions, with a substantial reduction in regional differences in per capita income. The A1 scenario family
develops into three groups that describe alternative directions of technological change in the energy system. The three groups are distinguished by
their technological emphasis: fossil fuel intensive
(A1FI), non-fossil fuel energy sources (A1T), or a
balance across all sources (A1B) – where balance
is deﬁned as not relying too heavily on one particular energy source, on the assumption that similar
improvement rates apply to all energy-supply and
end-use technologies.

A2 Storyline
The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a
very heterogeneous world. The underlying theme
is self-reliance and preservation of local identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very
slowly, which results in a continuously increasing
population. Economic development is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth
and technological change more fragmented and
slower than other story lines.

B1 Storyline
The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a
convergent world, with the same global population
that peaks in mid century and declines thereafter as
in the A1 storyline, but with rapid change in economic structures towards a service and information economy, with reductions in material intensity
and the introduction of clean and resource-efﬁcient
technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to
economic, social and environmental sustainability,
including improved equity, but without additional
climate-related initiatives.

B2 Storyline
The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a
world in which the emphasis is on local solutions to
economic, social and environmental sustainability.
It is a world with a continuously increasing global
population, at a rate lower than in A2, intermediate
levels of economic development and less rapid and
more diverse technological change than in the B1
and A1 storylines. While the storyline is also oriented towards environmental protection and social
equity, it focuses on local and regional levels.
From the total set of thirty-ﬁve scenarios, an
illustrative scenario was chosen for each of the six
scenario groups A1B, A1FI, A1T, A2, B1 and B2.
All should be considered equally sound. It is mostly
for this set of six illustrative scenarios that data are
presented in this chapter.
The SRES scenarios do not include additional
climate initiatives, which means that no scenarios
are included that explicitly assume implementation
of the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change or the emissions targets of the
Kyoto Protocol.

118

Climate change in the twenty-ﬁrst century and beyond

The next stage in the development of projections of climate change is
to turn the emission proﬁles of greenhouse gases into greenhouse gas
concentrations (Figure 6.2) and then into radiative forcing (Table 6.1 and
Figure 6.4(a)). The methods by which these are done are described in
Chapter 3, where the main sources of uncertainty are also mentioned.
For the carbon dioxide concentration scenarios these uncertainties, especially those concerning the magnitude of the climate feedback from the
terrestrial biosphere (see box on page 40), amount to a range of about
−10% to +30% in 2100 for each proﬁle.4
For most scenarios, emissions and concentrations of the main greenhouse gases increase during the twenty-ﬁrst century. However, despite the
increases projected in fossil fuel burning – very large increases in some
cases – emissions of sulphur dioxide (Figure 6.1) and hence the concentrations of sulphate particles are expected to fall substantially because
of the spread of policies to abate the damaging consequences of air pollution and ‘acid-rain’ deposition to both humans and ecosystems.5 The
inﬂuence of sulphate particles in tending to reduce the warming due to increased greenhouse gases is therefore now projected to be much less than
for projections made in the mid 1990s (see the IS 92a scenario for sulphur dioxide in Figure 6.1). The other anthropogenic sources of particles
in the atmosphere listed in Figure 3.8 will also contribute small amounts
of positive or negative radiative forcing during the twenty-ﬁrst century.6

Model projections
Results which come from the most sophisticated coupled atmosphere–
ocean models of the kind described in the last chapter provide fundamental information on which to base climate projections. However, because
they are so demanding on computer time only a limited number of results
from such models are available. Many studies have also therefore been
carried out with simpler models. Some of these, while possessing a full
description of atmospheric processes, only include a simpliﬁed description of the ocean; these can be useful in exploring regional change.
Others, sometimes called energy balance models (see box on page 121),
drastically simplify the dynamics and physics of both atmosphere and
ocean and are useful in exploring changes in the global average response
with widely different emission scenarios. Results from simpliﬁed models need to be carefully compared with those from the best coupled
atmosphere–ocean models and the simpliﬁed models ‘tuned’ so that, for
the particular parameters for which they are being employed, agreement
with the more complete models is as close as possible. The projections
presented in the next sections depend on results from all these kinds of
models.

concentration has become known as the climate sensitivity.7 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its 1990 Report gave
a ‘best estimate’ of 2.5 ◦ C for the climate sensitivity; it also considered
that it was unlikely to lie outside the range of 1.5 ◦ C to 4.5 ◦ C, a range
that encompasses the results of the best coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). The IPCC 1995 and 2001 Reports
have conﬁrmed these values. Reasons why there remains this range of
uncertainty in the estimates from climate models were explained in Chapter 5. The projections presented in this chapter follow the IPCC 2001
Assessment.8

Projections of global average temperature
When information of the kind illustrated in Figures 6.1, 6.2 and 6.4(a) is
incorporated into simple or more complex models, projections of climate
change can be made. As we have seen in earlier chapters, a useful proxy

Simple climate models
In Chapter 5 a detailed description was given of
general circulation models (GCMs) of the atmosphere and the ocean and of the way in which they
are coupled together (in AOGCMs) to provide simulations of the current climate and of climate perturbed by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse
gases. These models provide the basis of our projections of the detail of future climate. However,
because they are so elaborate, they take a great deal
of computer time so that only a few simulations can
be run with these large coupled models.
To carry out more simulations under different future emission proﬁles of greenhouse gases
or of aerosols or to explore the sensitivity of future change to different parameters (for instance,
parameters describing the feedbacks in the atmosphere which largely deﬁne the climate sensitivity), extensive use has been made of simple climate
models.9 These simpler models are ‘tuned’ so as to
agree closely with the results of the more complex
AOGCMs in cases where they can be compared.

The most radical simpliﬁcation in the simpler models is to remove one or more of the dimensions so
that the quantities of interest are averaged over latitude circles (in two-dimensional models) or over
the whole globe (in one-dimensional models). Such
models can, of course, only simulate latitudinal or
global averages – they can provide no regional information.
Figure 6.3 illustrates the components of such a
model in which the atmosphere is contained within
a ‘box’ with appropriate radiative inputs and outputs. Exchange of heat occurs at the land surface
(another ‘box’) and the ocean surface. Within the
ocean allowance is made for vertical diffusion and
vertical circulation. Such a model is appropriate
for simulating changes in global average surface
temperature with increasing greenhouse gases or
aerosols. When exchanges of carbon dioxide across
the interfaces between the atmosphere, the land and
the ocean are also included, the model can be employed to simulate the carbon cycle.

Projections of global average temperature

for climate change that has been widely used is the change in global
average temperature.
The projected rise in global average temperature due to the increase
in greenhouse gases and aerosols from pre-industrial times is illustrated
in Figure 6.4(b). It shows an increase of about 0.6 ◦ C up to the year 2000
and an increase ranging from about 2 ◦ C to about 6 ◦ C by 2100 – that
wide range resulting from the very large uncertainty regarding future
emissions and also from the uncertainty that remains regarding the feedbacks associated with the climate response to the changing atmospheric
composition (as described in Chapter 5).10
Compared with the temperature changes normally experienced from
day to day and throughout the year, changes of between 2 ◦ C and 6 ◦ C
may not seem very large. But, as was pointed out in Chapter 1, it is in
fact a large amount when considering globally averaged temperature.
Compare it with the 5 ◦ C or 6 ◦ C change in global average temperature
that occurs between the middle of an ice age and the warm period in
between ice ages. The changes projected for the twenty-ﬁrst century
are from one-third to a whole ice age in terms of the degree of climate
change!
The rate of change of global average temperature projected for the
twenty-ﬁrst century is in the range of 0.15 ◦ C to 0.6 ◦ C per decade.
These might seem small rates of change; most people would ﬁnd it
hard to detect a change in temperature of a fraction of a degree. But
remembering again that these are global averages, such rates of change
become very large. Indeed, they are much larger than any rates of change
the climate has experienced for at least the past 10 000 years as inferred
from paleoclimate data. As we shall see in the next chapter, the ability
of both humans and ecosystems to adapt to climate change depends
critically on the rate of change.
The changes in global average temperature shown in Figure 6.4(b)
from the IPCC 2001 Report are substantially greater than those shown
in the IPCC 1995 Report. The main reason for the difference is the much
smaller aerosol emissions in the SRES scenarios compared with the
IS 92 scenarios. This is illustrated by the temperature in 2100 shown
in Figure 6.4(b) for the IS 92a scenario which is similar to that for the
SRES B2 scenario even though the carbon dioxide emissions at that date
for IS 92a are ﬁfty per cent greater than those for B2.
In many of the modelling studies of climate change, the situation
of doubled pre-industrial atmospheric carbon dioxide has often been introduced as a benchmark especially to assist in comparisons between
different model projections and their possible impacts. Since the preindustrial concentration was about 280 ppm, doubled carbon dioxide is
about 560 ppm. From the curves in Figure 6.2 this is likely to occur

123

124

Climate change in the twenty-ﬁrst century and beyond

sometime in the second half of the twenty-ﬁrst century, depending on
the scenario. But, other greenhouse gases are also increasing and contributing to the radiative forcing. So as to achieve an overall picture more
easily, it is often convenient to convert other greenhouse gases to equivalent amounts of carbon dioxide, in other words to amounts of carbon
dioxide that would give the same radiative forcing.11 The information
in Table 6.1 enables the conversion to be carried out. For instance, the
increases in the greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide (including
ozone) to date produce about eighty per cent of the radiative forcing due
to the increase in carbon dioxide to date (see Figure 3.8). This proportion will drop substantially during the next few decades as the growth in
carbon dioxide becomes more dominant in nearly all scenarios. Referring to Figure 6.4(a), and noting that doubled carbon dioxide produces a
radiative forcing of about 3.7 W m−2 , it can be seen that doubling of the
equivalent carbon dioxide amount from pre-industrial times will occur
between 2040 and 2070 depending on the scenario.
Now, in Figure 6.4(a), select one of the scenarios, say A1B, and
note that the radiative forcing for this scenario reaches that equivalent
to doubled carbon dioxide (i.e. 3.7 W m−2 ) in about 2040. Then move to
Figure 6.4(b) and note that in 2040 the temperature rise is about 1.7 ◦ C.
This is only just over half the 2.8 ◦ C (the value for climate sensitivity
used for the results presented in Figure 6.4(b) see ﬁgure caption) that
would be expected for doubled carbon dioxide under steady conditions.
As was shown in Chapter 5, this difference occurs because of the slowing
effect of the oceans on the temperature rise. But this means that, as the
carbon dioxide concentration continues to increase, at any given time
there exists a commitment to further signiﬁcant temperature rise which
has not been realised at that time.

Regional patterns of climate change
So far we have been presenting global climate change in terms of likely
increases in global average surface temperature that provide a useful
overall indicator of the magnitude of climate change. In terms of regional
implications, however, a global average conveys rather little information.
What is required is spatial detail. It is in the regional or local changes
that the effects and impacts of global climate change will be felt.
With respect to regional change, it is important to realise that, because of the way the atmospheric circulation operates and the interactions
that govern the behaviour of the whole climate system, climate change
over the globe will not be at all uniform. We can, for instance, expect
substantial differences between the changes over large land masses and
over the ocean; land possesses a much smaller thermal capacity and

Regional patterns of climate change

so can respond more quickly. Listed below are some of the broad features on the continental scale that characterise the projected temperature
changes; more detailed patterns are illustrated in Figure 6.5(a). Reference to Chapter 4 indicates that many of these characteristics are already
being found in the observed record of the last few decades.
r Generally greater surface warming of land areas than of the oceans
typically by about forty per cent compared with the global average,
greater than this in northern high latitudes in winter (associated with
reduced sea ice and snow cover) and less than forty per cent in south
and southeast Asia in summer and in southern South America in winter.
r Minimum warming around Antarctica and in the northern North
Atlantic which is associated with deep oceanic mixing in those areas.
r Little warming over the Arctic in summer.
r Little seasonal variation of the warming in low latitudes or over the
southern circumpolar ocean.
r A reduction in diurnal temperature range over land in most seasons
and most regions; night time lows increase more than daytime highs.
So far we have been presenting results solely for atmospheric temperature change. An even more important indicator of climate change
is precipitation. With warming at the Earth’s surface there is increased
evaporation from the oceans and also from many land areas leading on
average to increased atmospheric water vapour content and therefore also
on average to increased precipitation. Since the water-holding capacity
of the atmosphere increases by about 6.5% per degree celsius,12 the increases in precipitation as surface temperature rises can be expected to be
substantial. In fact, model projections indicate increases in precipitation
broadly related to surface temperature increases of about three per cent
per degree celsius.13 Further, since the largest component of the energy
input to the atmospheric circulation comes from the release of latent
heat as water vapour condenses, the energy available to the atmosphere’s
circulation will increase in proportion to the atmospheric water content.
A characteristic therefore of anthropogenic climate change due to the
increase of greenhouse gases will be a more intense hydrological cycle.
The likely effect of this on precipitation extremes will be discussed in
the next section.
In Figure 6.5(b) are shown the projected changes in the distribution of
precipitation. Although on average precipitation increases there are large
regional variations and large areas where there are likely to be decreases
in average precipitation and also changes in its seasonal distribution. For
instance, at high northern latitudes there are large increases in winter and
over south Asia in summer. Southern Europe, Central America, southern
Africa and Australia are likely to have drier summers.

Figure 6.5 (Cont.).

Much natural climate variability occurs because of changes in, or
oscillations between, persistent climatic patterns or regimes. The Paciﬁc,
North Atlantic Anomaly (PNA – that is dominated by high pressure over
the eastern Paciﬁc and western North America and which tends to lead to
very cold winters in the eastern United States), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO – that has a strong inﬂuence on the character of the winters
in north west Europe) and the El Ni˜no events mentioned in Chapter 5
are examples of such regimes. Important components of climate change
in response to the forcing due to the increase in greenhouse gases can be
expected to be in the form of changes in the intensity or the frequency of
established climate patterns illustrated by these regimes.14 There is little
consistency at the present time between models regarding projections of
many of these patterns. However, recent trends in the tropical Paciﬁc for
the surface temperature to become more El Ni˜no-like (see Table 4.1 on

120E

180

128

Climate change in the twenty-ﬁrst century and beyond

page 62–3), with the warming in the eastern tropical Paciﬁc more than
that in the western tropical Paciﬁc and with a corresponding eastward
shift of precipitation, are projected to continue by many models. There
is also evidence that warming associated with increasing greenhouse gas
concentrations will cause an intensiﬁcation of the Asian summer monsoon and an increase of variability in its precipitation. The inﬂuence of
increased greenhouse gases on these major climate regimes, especially
the El Ni˜no, is an important and urgent area of research.
A complication in the interpretation of patterns of climate change
arises because of the differing inﬂuence of atmospheric aerosols as compared with that of greenhouse gases. Although in the projections based
on the SRES scenarios the inﬂuence of aerosols is much less than in those
based on the IS 92 scenarios published by the IPCC in its 1995 Report,15
their projected radiative forcing is still signiﬁcant. When considering
global average temperature and its impact on, for instance, sea level rise
(see Chapter 7) it is appropriate in the projections to use the values of
globally averaged radiative forcing. The negative radiative forcing from
sulphate aerosol, for instance, then becomes an offset to the positive
forcing from the increase in greenhouse gases. However, because the
effects of aerosol forcing are far from uniform over the globe (Figure
3.7), it is not correct, when considering climate change and its regional
characteristics, to consider the effects of increasing aerosol as a simple
offset to those of the increase in greenhouse gases. The large variations in
regional forcing due to aerosols produce substantial regional variations
in the climate response. Detailed regional information from the best climate models needs to be employed to assess the climate change under
different assumptions about the increases in both greenhouse gases and
aerosols.

Changes in climate extremes
The last section looked at the likely regional patterns of climate change.
Can anything be said about likely changes in the frequency or intensity of
climate extremes in the future? It is, after all, not the changes in average
climate that are generally noticeable, but the extremes of climate – the
droughts, the ﬂoods, the storms and the extremes of temperature in very
cold or very warm periods – which provide the largest impact on our
lives (see Chapter 1).
The most obvious change we can expect in extremes is a large
increase in the number of extremely warm days (Figure 6.6) coupled
with a decrease in the number of extremely cold days. A number of
model projections show a generally decreased daily variability of surface
air temperature in winter and increased daily variability in summer in

Northern Hemisphere land areas, suggesting that the situation in Figure
6.6(c) could apply in these areas. An example of this can be found in the
box in Chapter 7 on page 177.
However, the changes that are likely to lead to most impact are those
connected with the hydrological cycle. In the last section it was explained
that in a warmer world with increased greenhouse gases, average precipitation increases and the hydrological cycle becomes more intense.16
Consider what might occur in regions of increased rainfall. Often in such
regions with the more intense hydrological cycle the larger amounts of
rainfall will come from increased convective activity: more really heavy
showers and more intense thunderstorms. The result of a study with an
Australian climate model of the effect on rainfall amounts of doubling

model in Australia.

the carbon dioxide concentration is shown in Figure 6.7. The number of
days with large rainfall amounts (greater than 25 mm day−1 ) doubled.
The probability of conditions leading to ﬂoods would also at least have
doubled. Similar results (fewer rainy days, higher maximum daily rainfalls for a given mean rainfall rate) have been obtained from many other
climate models. For instance, a recent modelling study (Figure 6.8) has
shown that if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is doubled from
its pre-industrial value, the probability of extreme seasonal precipitation
in winter is likely to increase substantially over large areas of central and
northern Europe and likely to decrease over parts of the Mediterranean
and north Africa. The increase in parts of central Europe is such that
the return period of extreme rainfall events would decrease by about a
factor of ﬁve (e.g. from ﬁfty years to ten years). Similar results have been
obtained in a study of major river basins around the world.17
Note also from Figure 6.7 that the number of days with lighter rainfall events (less than 6 mm/day) is expected to decrease in the globally
warmed world. This is because, with the more intense hydrological cycle, a greater proportion of the rainfall will fall in the more intense events
and, furthermore, in regions of convection the areas of downdraught become drier as the areas of updraught become more moist. In many areas
with relatively low rainfall, the rainfall will tend to become less – which
has implications for the likelihood of drought.
Take, for instance, the likelihood of drought in regions where the
average summer rainfall falls by perhaps twenty per cent as is likely to
occur, for instance, in southern Europe (Figure 6.5(b)). The likely result
of such a drop in rainfall is not that the number of rainy days will remain
the same, with less rain falling each time; it is more likely that there
will be substantially fewer rainy days and considerably more chance of

prolonged periods of no rainfall at all (see Figure 6.9). In other words,
much more likelihood of drought. Further, the higher temperatures will
lead to increased evaporation reducing the amount of moisture available
at the surface – thus adding to the drought conditions. The proportional
increase in the likelihood of drought is much greater than the proportional
decrease in average rainfall.
Thus in the warmer world of increased greenhouse gases, different
places will experience more frequent droughts and ﬂoods – we noted in
Chapter 1 that these are the climate extremes which cause the greatest
problems and we will be considering the impacts in more detail in the
next chapter.
What about other climate extremes, intense storms, for instance?
How about hurricanes and typhoons, the violent rotating cyclones that
are found over the tropical oceans and which cause such devastation
when they hit land? The energy for such storms largely comes from
the latent heat of the water which has been evaporated from the warm

ocean surface and which condenses in the clouds within the storm, releasing energy. It might be expected that warmer sea temperatures would
mean more energy release, leading to more frequent and intense storms.
However, ocean temperature is not the only parameter controlling the
genesis of tropical storms; the nature of the overall atmospheric ﬂow is
also important. Further, although based on limited data, observed variations in the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones show no clear
trends in the last half of the twentieth century. Models can take all the
relevant factors into account but, because of the relatively large size
of their grid, they are unable to simulate very reliably the detail of relatively small disturbances such as tropical cyclones. There is no consistent

Regional climate models

evidence from model projections of changes in the frequency of tropical cyclones or their areas of formation. However, model projections18
and theoretical studies suggest that, if carbon dioxide concentration is
doubled, the peak wind intensities will tend to increase by perhaps ﬁve or
ten per cent and the mean and peak precipitation intensities by twenty to
thirty per cent.
Regarding storms at mid latitudes, the various factors that control
their incidence are complex. Two factors tend to an increased intensity of
storms. The ﬁrst, as with tropical storms, is that higher temperatures, especially of the ocean surface, tend to lead to more energy being available.
The second factor is that the larger temperature contrast between land
and sea, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, tends to generate steeper
temperature gradients, which in turn generate stronger ﬂow and greater
likelihood of instability. The region around the Atlantic seaboard of
Europe is one area where such increased storminess might be expected,
a result that some model projections have shown. However, such a picture
may well be too simple; other models suggest changes in storm tracks
that result in very different changes in some regions and there is little
overall consistency between model projections.
For some other extremes such as very small-scale phenomena (e.g.
tornadoes, thunderstorms, hail and lightning) that cannot be simulated in
global models, although they may have important impacts, there is currently insufﬁcient information to assess recent trends, and understanding
is inadequate to make ﬁrm projections.
Table 6.2 summarises the state of knowledge regarding the likely future incidence of extreme events. Although general indications of trends
can be given, there have been few projections with quantitative estimates
of likely changes in the frequency or intensity of extreme events. In many
research centres, work is under way on more detailed studies of the inﬂuence of increased greenhouse gases on extreme events and changes in
climate variability.

Regional climate models
Most of the likely changes that we have presented have been on the scale
of continents. Can more speciﬁc information be provided about change
for smaller regions? In Chapter 5 we referred to the limitation of global
circulation models (GCM) in the simulation of changes on the regional
scale19 arising from the coarse size of their horizontal grid – typically 300
km or more. Also in Chapter 5 we introduced the regional climate model
(RCM) that typically possesses a resolution of 50 km and can be ‘nested’
in a global circulation model. Examples are shown in Figures 6.10 and
7.8 of the improvement achieved by RCMs in the simulation of extremes

and in providing regional detail that in many cases (especially for precipitation) shows substantial disagreement with the averages provided by
a GCM.
Regional models are providing a powerful tool for the investigation of
detail in patterns of climate change. In the next chapter the importance
of such detail will be very apparent in studies that assess the impacts
of climate change. However, it is important to realise that, even if the
models were perfect, because much greater natural variability is apparent
in local climate than in climate averaged over continental or larger scales,
projections on the local and regional scale are bound to be more uncertain
than those on larger scales.

Longer-term climate change
Most of the projections of future climate that have been published cover
the Twenty-ﬁrst century. For instance, the curves plotted in Figure 6.2 extend to the year 2100. They illustrate what is likely to occur if fossil fuels
continue to provide most of the world’s energy needs during that period.
From the beginning of the industrial revolution until 2000 the burning
of fossil fuels released approximately 600 Gt of carbon in the form of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Under the SRES A1B scenario it is
projected that a further 1500 Gt will be released by the year 2100. As
Chapter 11 will show, the reserves of fossil fuels in total are sufﬁcient to
enable their rate of use to continue to grow well beyond the year 2100.
If that were to happen the global average temperature would continue
to rise and could, in the twenty-second century, reach very high levels,
perhaps up to 10 ◦ C higher than today (see Chapter 9). The associated
changes in climate would be correspondingly large and could well be
irreversible.
A further longer-term effect that may become important during this
century is that of positive feedbacks on the carbon cycle due to climate
change. This was mentioned in Chapter 3 (see box on page 40) and the
+30% uncertainty in 2100 in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon
dioxide shown in Figure 6.2 was introduced to allow for it. Taking this
effect into account would add nearly a further degree Celsius to the
projected increase in global average temperature in 2100 at the top end
of the range shown in Figure 6.4. Some of the further implications of
this feedback will be considered in Chapter 10 on page 255–259.
Especially when considering the longer term, there is also the possibility of surprises – changes in the climate system that are unexpected.

their very nature such ‘surprises’ cannot, of course, be foreseen. However, there are various parts of the system which are, as yet, not well
understood, where such possibilities might be looked for20 ; for instance,
in the deep ocean circulation (see box in Chapter 5, page 99) or in the
stability of the major ice sheets. In the next section we shall look in more
detail at the ﬁrst of these possibilities; the second will be addressed
in the section of the next chapter entitled ‘How much will sea level
rise?’.

Changes in the ocean thermohaline circulation
The ocean thermohaline circulation (THC) was introduced in the box
on page 99 in Chapter 5, where Figure 5.18 illustrates the deep ocean
currents that transport heat and freshwater between all the world’s oceans.
Also mentioned in the box was the inﬂuence on the THC in past epochs
of the input of large amounts of fresh water from ice melt to the region in
the north Atlantic between Greenland and Scandinavia where the main
source region for the THC is located.
With climate change due to increasing greenhouse gases we have
seen that the precipitation will increase substantially especially at high
latitudes (Figure 6.5(b)), leading to additional fresh water input to the
oceans. The dense salty water in the north Atlantic source region for the
THC will become less salty and therefore less dense. As a result the THC
will weaken and less heat will ﬂow northward from tropical regions to the
north Atlantic. All coupled ocean–atmosphere GCMs show this occurring; an example is shown in Figure 6.11(a), which indicates a weakening
of about twenty per cent by 2100. Although there is disagreement between the models as to the extent of weakening, all model projections
of the pattern of temperature change under increasing greenhouse gases
show less warming in the region of the north Atlantic (Figure 6.5(a)) –
but none show actual cooling occurring in this region during the twentyﬁrst century. In the longer term, some models show the THC actually
cutting off completely after two or three centuries of increasing greenhouse gases. Figure 6.11(b) illustrates the effect that cut-off would have
on the pattern of surface temperature around the globe. Note the severe
cooling that would occur in the north Atlantic and north west Europe
and the small compensating warming in the Southern hemisphere. Intense research is being pursued – both observations and modelling – to
elucidate further likely changes in the thermohaline circulation and their
possible impact.

Other factors that might inﬂuence climate change
So far climate change due to human activities has been considered. Are
there other factors, external to the climate system, which might induce
change? Chapter 4 showed that it was variations in the incoming solar
energy as a result of changes in the Earth’s orbit which triggered the ice
ages and the major climate changes of the past. These variations are, of
course, still going on; what inﬂuence are they having now?
Over the past 10 000 years, because of these orbital changes, the solar
radiation incident at 60 ◦ N in July has decreased by about 35 W m−2 ,
which is quite a large amount. But over one hundred years the change is
only at most a few tenths of a watt per square metre, which is much less
than the changes due to the increases in greenhouse gases (remember
that doubling carbon dioxide alters the thermal radiation, globally
averaged, by about 4 W m−2 – see Chapter 2). Looking to the future
and the effect of the Earth’s orbital variations, over at least the next

Climate change in the twenty-ﬁrst century and beyond

Does the Sun’s output change?
century when very few sunspots were recorded.21
Studies of the recent measurements of solar output correlated with other indicators of solar activity, when extrapolated to this earlier period, suggest
that the Sun was a little less bright in the seventeenth
century, perhaps by about 0.4% or about 1 W m−2 in
the average solar energy incident on the Earth’s surface. This reduction in solar energy may have been
a cause of the cooler period at that time known as
the ‘Little Ice Age’. Careful studies have estimated
that since 1850 the maximum variations in the solar
energy incident on the Earth’s surface are unlikely
to be greater than about 0.5 W m−2 (Figure 6.12).
This is about the same as the change in the energy
regime at the Earth’s surface due to about a ten
years’ increase in greenhouse gases at the current
rate.

Radiative forcing (W m−2)

Some scientists have suggested that all climate variations, even short-term ones, might be the result of
changes in the Sun’s energy output. Such suggestions are bound to be somewhat speculative because
the only direct measurements of solar output that are
available are those since 1978, from satellites outside the disturbing effects of the Earth’s atmosphere.
These measurements indicate a very constant solar
output, changing by about 0.1% between a maximum and a minimum in the cycle of solar magnetic
activity indicated by the number of sunspots.
It is known from astronomical records and from
measurements of radioactive carbon in the atmosphere that this solar sunspot activity has, from time
to time over the past few thousand years, shown
large variations. Of particular interest is the period
known as the Maunder Minimum in the seventeenth

Figure 6.12 Radiative forcing due to variations in the energy input from the Sun as estimated by Lean
et al. (1995) and by Hoyt and Schatten (1993).

Notes

50 000 years the solar radiation incident in summer on the polar regions
will be unusually constant so that the present interglacial is expected to
last for an exceptionally long period.22 Suggestions therefore that the
current increase of greenhouse gases might delay the onset of the next
ice age are unfounded.
These orbital changes only alter the distribution of incoming solar
energy over the Earth’s surface; the total amount of energy reaching
the Earth is hardly affected by them. Of more immediate interest are
suggestions that the actual energy output of the Sun might change with
time. As we mentioned in Chapter 3 (see Figure 3.8) and as is described
in the box above, such changes, if they occur, are estimated to be much
smaller than changes in the energy regime at the Earth’s surface due to
the increase in greenhouse gases.
There have also been suggestions of plausible indirect mechanisms
whereby effects on the Sun might inﬂuence climate on Earth. Changes
in solar ultraviolet radiation will inﬂuence atmospheric ozone and hence
might affect climate. There is a possibility that the galactic cosmic
ray ﬂux, modiﬁed by the varying Sun’s magnetic ﬁeld, could inﬂuence cloudiness and hence climate. From studies of these possible
mechanisms there is as yet insufﬁcient evidence of signiﬁcant climate
effects.23
Another inﬂuence on climate comes from volcanic eruptions. Their
effects, lasting typically a few years, are relatively short-term compared
with the much longer-term effects of the increase of greenhouse gases.
The recent large volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines
which occurred in June 1991 has already been mentioned (Figure 5.21).
Estimates of the change in the net amount of radiation (solar and thermal)
at the top of the atmosphere resulting from this eruption are of about
0.5 W m−2 . This perturbation lasts for about two or three years while
the major part of the dust settles out of the atmosphere; the longer-term
change in radiation forcing, due to the minute particles of dust which
last in the stratosphere for somewhat longer, is much smaller.
To summarise this chapter:
r The increase in greenhouse gases is by far the largest of the factors
which can lead to climate change during the twenty-ﬁrst century.
r The likely climate changes for a range of scenarios of greenhouse gas
emissions have been described in terms of global average temperature
and in terms of regional change of temperature and precipitation and
the occurrence of extremes.
r The rate of change is likely to be larger than any the Earth has seen at
any time during the past 10 000 years.

139

140

Climate change in the twenty-ﬁrst century and beyond

r The changes that are likely to have the greatest impact will be changes
in the frequencies, intensities and locations of climate extremes, especially droughts and ﬂoods.
r Sufﬁcient fossil fuel reserves are available to provide for continuing
growth in fossil fuel emissions of carbon dioxide well into the twentysecond century. If this occurred the climate change could be very large
indeed and have unpredictable features or ‘surprises’.
The next chapter will look at the impact of such changes on sea level,
on water, on food supplies and on human health. Later chapters of the
book will then suggest what action might be taken to slow down and
eventually to terminate the rate of change.

Chapter 7

The impacts of climate change

The last two chapters have detailed the climate change that we can
expect during the twenty-ﬁrst century because of human activities in
terms of temperature and rainfall. To be useful to human communities,
these details need to be turned into descriptions of the impact of climate
change on human resources and activities. The questions to which we
want answers are: how much will sea level rise and what effect will that
have?; how much will water resources be affected?; what will be the
impact on agriculture and food supply?; will natural ecosystems suffer
damage and how will human health be affected? This chapter considers
these questions.1

A complex network of changes
In outlining the character of the likely climate change in different regions
of the world, the last chapter showed that it is likely to vary a great
deal from place to place. For instance, in some regions precipitation will
increase, in other regions it will decrease. Not only is there a large amount
of variability in the character of the likely change, there is also variability
in the sensitivity (for deﬁnition see box below) of different systems to
climate change. Different ecosystems, for instance, will respond very
differently to changes in temperature or precipitation.
There will be a few impacts of the likely climate change that will
be positive so far as humans are concerned. For instance, in parts of
Siberia or northern Canada increased temperature will tend to lengthen
the growing season with the possibility in these regions of growing
a greater variety of crops. In some places, increased carbon dioxide
143

144

The impacts of climate change

will aid the growth of some types of plants leading to increased crop
yields.

Sensitivity, adaptive capacity and vulnerability: some
deﬁnitions2
Sensitivity is the degree to which a system is affected, either adversely
or beneﬁcially, by climate-related stimuli. These encompass all the elements of climate change, including mean climate characteristics, climate
variability, and the frequency and magnitude of extremes. This may be
direct (e.g. a change in crop yield in response to a change in the mean,
range or variability of temperature) or indirect (e.g. damage caused by
an increase in the frequency of coastal ﬂooding due to sea level rise).
Adaptive capacity is the ability of a system to adjust to climate
change (including climate variability and extremes), to moderate potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities or to cope with the
consequences.
Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to, or
unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate
variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character,
magnitude and rate of climate change and also the extent to which a
system is exposed, its sensitivity and its adaptive capacity.
Both the magnitude and the rate of climate change are important in
determining the sensitivity, adaptability and vulnerability of a system.

However, because, over centuries, human communities have adapted
their lives and activities to the present climate, most changes in climate
will tend to produce an adverse impact. If the changes occur rapidly, quick
and possibly costly adaptation to a new climate will be required by the
affected community. An alternative might be for the affected community
to migrate to a region where less adaptation would be needed – a solution
which has become increasingly difﬁcult or, in some cases, impossible in
the modern crowded world.
As we consider the questions posed at the start of this chapter, it will
become clear that the answers are far from simple. It is relatively easy
to consider the effects of a particular change (in say, sea level or water
resources) supposing nothing else changes. But other factors will change.
Some adaptation, for both ecosystems and human communities, may be
relatively easy to achieve; in other cases, adaptation may be difﬁcult, very
costly or even impossible. In assessing the effects of global warming
and how serious they are, allowance must be made for response and
adaptation. The likely costs of adaptation also need to be put alongside
the costs of the losses or impacts connected with global warming.

How much will sea level rise?

Sensitivity, adaptive capacity and vulnerability (see box above)
vary a great deal from place to place and from country to country.
In particular, developing countries, especially the least developed
countries, have less capacity to adapt than developed countries, which
contributes to the relative high vulnerability to damaging effects of
climate change in developing countries.
The assessment of the impacts of global warming is also made more
complex because global warming is not the only human-induced environmental problem. The loss of soil and its impoverishment (through
poor agricultural practice), the over-extraction of groundwater and the
damage due to acid rain are examples of environmental degradations on
local or regional scales that are having a substantial impact now.3 If they
are not corrected they will tend to exacerbate the negative impacts likely
to arise from global warming. For these reasons, the various effects of
climate change so far as they concern human communities and their activities will be put in the context of other factors that might alleviate or
exacerbate their impact.
The assessment of climate change impacts, adaptations and vulnerability draws on a wide range of physical, biological and social science
disciplines and consequently employs a large variety of methods and
tools. It is therefore necessary to integrate information and knowledge
from these diverse disciplines; the process is called Integrated Assessment (see box in Chapter 9 on page 237).
The following paragraphs will look at various impacts in turn and
then bring them together in a consideration of the overall impact.

How much will sea level rise?
There is plenty of evidence for large changes in sea level during the
Earth’s history. For instance, during the warm period before the onset of
the last ice age, about 120 000 years ago, the global average temperature
was a little warmer than today (Figure 4.4). Average sea level then was
about 5 or 6 m higher than it is today. When ice cover was at its maximum
towards the end of the ice age, some 18 000 years ago, sea level was over
100 m lower than today, sufﬁcient, for instance, for Britain to be joined
to the continent of Europe.
It is often thought that the main cause of these sea level changes was
the melting or growth of the large ice-sheets that cover the polar regions.
It is certainly true that the main reason for the drop in sea level 18 000
years ago was the amount of water locked up in the large extension of the
polar ice-sheets. In the northern hemisphere these extended in Europe as
far south as southern England and in North America to south of the Great
Lakes. It must also be true that the main reason for the 5 or 6 m higher

145

146

The impacts of climate change

sea level during the last warm interglacial period was a reduction in the
Antarctic or Greenland ice-sheets. But changes over shorter periods are
largely governed by other factors that combine to produce a signiﬁcant
effect on the average sea level.
During the twentieth century observations show that the average sea
level rose by between 10 and 20 cm.4 The largest contribution to this
rise (about one-third) is from thermal expansion of ocean water; as the
oceans warm the water expands and the sea level rises (see box below).
Other signiﬁcant contributions come from the melting of glaciers and as
a result of long-term adjustments that are still occurring because of the
removal of the major ice-sheets 20 000 years or so ago. The contributions
from the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica are believed to be small.
A further contribution to sea level change of uncertain magnitude arises
from changes in terrestrial storage of water, for instance from the growth
of reservoirs or irrigation.

Thermal expansion of the oceans
A large component of sea level rise is due to thermal expansion of the
oceans. Calculation of the precise amount of expansion is complex because it depends critically on the water temperature. For cold water the
expansion for a given change of temperature is small. The maximum
density of sea water occurs at temperatures close to 0 ◦ C; for a small
temperature rise at a temperature close to 0 ◦ C, therefore, the expansion
is negligible. At 5 ◦ C (a typical temperature at high latitudes), a rise of
1 ◦ C causes an increase of water volume of about 1 part in 10 000 and
at 25 ◦ C (typical of tropical latitudes) the same temperature rise of 1 ◦ C
increases the volume by about 3 parts in 10 000. For instance, if the top
100 m of ocean (which is approximately the depth of what is called the
mixed layer) was at 25 ◦ C, a rise to 26 ◦ C would increase its depth by
about 3 cm.
A further complication is that not all the ocean changes temperature
at the same rate. The mixed layer fairly rapidly comes into equilibrium
with changes induced by changes in the atmosphere. The rest of the ocean
changes comparatively slowly (the whole of the top kilometre will, for
instance, take many decades to warm); some parts may not change at all.
Therefore, to calculate the sea level rise due to thermal expansion – its
global average and its regional variations – it is necessary to employ the
results of an ocean climate model, of the kind described in Chapter 5.

Various contributions to the likely sea level rise in the twenty-ﬁrst
century can be identiﬁed. Again the largest is from the thermal expansion
of ocean water. The other main contribution comes from the melting of

How much will sea level rise?

glaciers. If all glaciers outside Antarctica and Greenland were to melt, the
rise in sea level would be about 50 cm (between 40 and 60 cm). Substantial glacier retreat has occurred in recent decades adding an estimated
2–4 cm to the sea level rise in the twentieth century. Modelling the effect
of climate change on the behaviour of glaciers is, however, complex.
The growth or decay of a glacier depends on the balance between the
amount of snowfall on it, especially in winter, and the amount of melting
in the summer. Both winter snowfall and average summer temperature
are important, and both must be taken into account in future projections
of the rate of glacier melting.
The average sea level rise during the twenty-ﬁrst century for each of
the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) has been calculated
by adding up the various contributions. Those due to thermal expansion (typically about sixty per cent of the total) and land ice changes
(typically about twenty-ﬁve per cent of the total) were calculated using a simple climate model calibrated separately for each of seven coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) (as in the
calculations for changes in global average temperature in Figure 6.4).
The relatively small contributions from changes in permafrost, the effect
of sediment deposition and the long-term adjustment of the ice-sheets
to past climate change were then added. The results are shown in Figure 7.1, where it will be seen that the uncertainties in the estimates are
substantial. Apart from the uncertainties inherent in the emissions scenarios, there is the uncertainty in the actual temperature rise (and hence in
the contribution from thermal expansion) depending on the value chosen for the climate sensitivity (Figure 6.4). Different models also give
substantially different estimates of the amount of sea level rise due to
the melt from glaciers and small ice caps. The total range of uncertainty
by 2100 is from about 10 cm to 90 cm.
The projections in Figure 7.1 apply to the next 100 years. During
that period, because of the slow mixing that occurs throughout much of
the oceans, only a small part of the ocean will have warmed signiﬁcantly.
Sea level rise resulting from global warming will therefore lag behind
temperature change at the surface (Figure 7.2). During the following
centuries, as the rest of the oceans gradually warm, sea level will continue
to rise at about the same rate, even if the average temperature at the
surface were to be stabilised.
The estimates of average sea level rise in Figure 7.1 provide a general
guide as to what can be expected during the twenty-ﬁrst century. Sea level
rise, however, will not be uniform over the globe. The effects of thermal
expansion in the oceans will vary considerably with location. Further,
movements of the land occurring for natural reasons due, for instance,
to tectonic movements or because of human activities (for instance, the

removal of groundwater) can have comparable effects to the rate of sea
level rise arising from global warming. At any given place, all these
factors have to be taken into account in determining the likely value of
future sea level rise.
It is interesting and perhaps surprising that the net contribution expected from changes in the Antarctic and Greenland ice-sheets is small.
For both ice-sheets there are two competing effects.5 In a warmer world,
there is more water vapour in the atmosphere which leads to more snowfall. But there is also more ablation (erosion by melting) of the ice around
the boundaries of the ice-sheets where melting of the ice and calving of
icebergs occur during the summer months. For Antarctica, the estimates
are that accumulation is greater than ablation, leading to a small net
growth. For Greenland, ablation is greater than accumulation. For the
two taken together, under current conditions, the net effect is about zero,
although there is considerable uncertainty in that estimate.
If we look further into the future, however, larger changes in the
ice-sheets may begin to occur. The Greenland ice-sheet is the more vulnerable; its complete melting will cause a sea level rise of about 7 m.
Model studies of the ice-sheet show that, with a temperature rise of
more than 3 ◦ C, ablation will signiﬁcantly overtake accumulation and
meltdown of the ice cap will begin. Figure 7.3 illustrates the rate of sea

level rise over the next millennium that might be expected with different
levels of temperature change at Greenland. A warming of 5.5 ◦ C, for
instance, if sustained for 1000 years, would be likely to result in about
3 m of sea level rise.
The portion of the Antarctic ice-sheet that is of most concern is that
in the west of Antarctica (around 90◦ W longitude); its disintegration
would result in about a 6-m sea level rise. Because a large portion of
it is grounded well below sea level it has been suggested that rapid
ice discharge could occur if the surrounding ice shelves are weakened.
Although studies are far from conclusive, current ice dynamic models
do not indicate that rapid disintegration is likely and suggest that, over
the next millennium, the contribution of the west Antarctic ice-sheet to
sea level rise will be less than 3 m.

The impacts of sea level rise
A rise in average sea level of 10 cm by 2030 and about half a metre by the
end of the next century (typical values from Figure 7.1) may not seem a
great deal. Many people live sufﬁciently above the level of high water not
to be directly affected. However, half of humanity inhabits the coastal
zones around the world. Within these, the lowest lying are some of the
most fertile and densely populated. To people living in these areas, even
a fraction of a metre increase in sea level can add enormously to their
problems. Some of the areas that are especially vulnerable are, ﬁrstly,
large river delta areas, for instance Bangladesh; secondly, areas very
close to sea level where sea defences are already in place, for instance
the Netherlands; and, thirdly, small low-lying islands in the Paciﬁc and
other oceans. We shall look at these in turn.
Bangladesh is a densely populated country of about 120 million
people located in the complex delta region of the Ganges, Brahmaputra
and Meghna Rivers.6 About ten per cent of the country’s habitable land
(with about six million population) would be lost with half a metre of sea
level rise and about twenty per cent (with about 15 million population)
would be lost with a 1-m rise7 (Figure 7.4). Estimates of the sea level
rise are of about 1 m by 2050 (compounded of 70 cm due to subsidence
because of land movements and removal of groundwater and 30 cm from
the effects of global warming) and nearly 2 m by 2100 (1.2 m due to
subsidence and 70 cm from global warming)8 – although there is a large
uncertainty in these estimates.
It is quite impractical to consider full protection of the long and
complicated coastline of Bangladesh from sea level rise. Its most obvious
effect, therefore, is that substantial amounts of good agricultural land
will be lost. This is serious: half the country’s economy comes from

The impacts of sea level rise

amounts of sea level rise.

agriculture and eighty-ﬁve per cent of the nation’s population depends
on agriculture for its livelihood. Many of these people are at the very
edge of subsistence.
But the loss of land is not the only effect of sea level rise. Bangladesh
is extremely prone to damage from storm surges. Every year, on average,
at least one major cyclone attacks Bangladesh. During the past twentyﬁve years there have been two very large disasters with extensive ﬂooding
and loss of life. The storm surge in November 1970 is probably the largest
of the world’s natural disasters in recent times; it is estimated to have
claimed the lives of over a quarter of a million people. Well over a 100 000
are thought to have lost their lives in a similar storm in April 1991. Even
small rises in sea level add to the vulnerability of the region to such
storms.
There is a further effect of sea level rise on the productivity of agricultural land; that is, the intrusion of saltwater into fresh groundwater

152

The impacts of climate change

resources. At the present time, it is estimated that in some parts of
Bangladesh saltwater extends seasonally inland over 150 km. With a
1-m rise in sea level, the area affected by saline intrusion could increase
substantially9 although, since it is also likely that climate change will
bring increased monsoon rainfall, some of the intrusion of saltwater
could be alleviated.10
What possible responses can Bangladesh make to these likely future
problems? Over the timescale of change that is currently envisaged it
can be supposed that the ﬁshing industry can relocate and respond with
ﬂexibility to changing ﬁshing areas and changing conditions. It is less
easy to see what the population of the affected agricultural areas can do to
relocate or to adapt. No signiﬁcant areas of agricultural land are available
elsewhere in Bangladesh to replace that lost to the sea, nor is there
anywhere else in Bangladesh where the population of the delta region
can easily be located. It is clear that very careful study and management
of all aspects of the problem is required. The sediment brought down by
the rivers into the delta region is of particular importance. The amount
of sediment and how it is used can have a large effect on the level of the
land affected by sea level rise. Careful management is therefore required
upstream as well as in the delta itself; groundwater and sea defences
must also be managed carefully if some alleviation of the effects of sea
level rise is to be achieved.
A similar situation exists in the Nile delta region of Egypt. The likely
rise in sea level this century is made up from local subsidence and global
warming in much the same way as for Bangladesh – approximately 1 m
by 2050 and 2 m by 2100. About twelve per cent of the country’s arable
land with a population of over seven million people would be affected by
a 1-m rise of sea level.11 Some protection from the sea is afforded by the
extensive sand dunes but only up to half a metre or so of sea level rise.12
Many other examples of vulnerable delta regions, especially in southeast Asia and Africa, can be given where the problems would be similar
to those in Bangladesh and in Egypt. For instance, several large and lowlying alluvial plains are distributed along the eastern coastline of China.
A sea level rise of just half a metre would inundate an area of about
40 000 km2 (about the area of The Netherlands)13 where over thirty million people currently live. A particular delta which has been extensively
studied is that of the Mississippi in North America. These studies underline the point that human activities and industry are already exacerbating
the potential problems of sea level rise due to global warming. Because
of river management little sediment is delivered by the river to the delta
to counter the subsidence occurring because of long-term movements of
the Earth’s crust. Also, the building of canals and dykes has inhibited
the input of sediments from the ocean.14 Studies of this kind emphasise

The impacts of sea level rise

the importance of careful management of all activities inﬂuencing such
regions, and the necessity of making maximum use of natural processes
in ensuring their continued viability.
We now turn to The Netherlands, a country more than half of which
consists of coastal lowlands, mainly below present sea level. It is one
of the most densely populated areas in the world; eight of the fourteen
million inhabitants of the region live in large cities such as Rotterdam,
The Hague and Amsterdam. An elaborate system of about 400 km of
dykes and coastal dunes, built up over many years, protects it from the
sea. Recent methods of protection, rather than creating solid bulwarks,
make use of the effects of various forces (tides, currents, waves, wind
and gravity) on the sands and sediments so as to create a stable barrier
against the sea – similar policies are advocated for the protection of
the Norfolk coast in eastern England.15 Protection against sea level rise
next century will require no new technology. Dykes and sand dunes will
need to be raised; additional pumping will also be necessary to combat
the incursion of saltwater into freshwater aquifers. It is estimated16 that
an expenditure of about twelve thousand million dollars (US) would be
required for protection against a sea level rise of 1 m.
The third type of area of especial vulnerability is the low-lying small
island.17 Half a million people live in archipelagos of small islands and
coral atolls, such as the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, consisting of
1190 individual islands, and the Marshall Islands in the Paciﬁc, which
lie almost entirely within 3 m of sea level. Half a metre or more of sea
level rise would reduce their areas substantially – some would have to
be abandoned – and remove up to ﬁfty per cent of their groundwater.
The cost of protection from the sea is far beyond the resources of these
islands’ populations. For coral atolls, rise in sea level at a rate of up to
about half a metre per century can be matched by coral growth, providing
that growth is not disturbed by human interference and providing also
that the growth is not inhibited by a rise in the maximum sea temperature
exceeding about 1–2 ◦ C.18
These are some examples of areas particularly vulnerable to sea level
rise. Many other areas in the world will be affected in similar, although
perhaps less dramatic, ways. Many of the world’s cities are close to sea
level and are being increasingly affected by subsidence because of the
withdrawal of groundwater. The rise of sea level due to global warming
will add to this problem. There is no technical difﬁculty for most cities in
taking care of these problems, but the cost of doing so must be included
when calculating the overall impact of global warming.
So far, in considering the impact of sea level rise, places of dense
population where there is a large effect on people have been considered.
There are also areas of importance where few people live. The world’s

153

154

The impacts of climate change

wetlands and mangrove swamps currently occupy an area of about a
million square kilometres (the ﬁgure is not known very precisely), equal
approximately to twice the area of France. They contain much biodiversity and their biological productivity equals or exceeds that of any
other natural or agricultural system. Over two-thirds of the ﬁsh caught
for human consumption, as well as many birds and animals, depend on
coastal marshes and swamps for part of their life cycles, so they are
vital to the total world ecology. Such areas can adjust to slow levels of
sea level rise, but there is no evidence that they could keep pace with
a rate of rise of greater than about 2 mm per year – 20 cm per century.
What will tend to occur, therefore, is that the area of wetlands will extend inland, sometimes with a loss of good agricultural land. However,
because in many places such extension will be inhibited by the presence
of ﬂood embankments and other human constructions, erosion of the
seaward boundaries of the wetlands will lead more usually to a loss of
wetland area. Because of a variety of human activities (such as shoreline
protection, blocking of sediment sources, land reclamation, aquaculture
development and oil, gas and water extraction), coastal wetlands are currently being lost at a rate of 0.5–1.5% per year. Sea level rise because of
climate change would further exacerbate this loss.19
To summarise the impact of the half-metre or so of sea level rise
due to global warming which could occur during the twenty-ﬁrst century: global warming is not the only reason for sea level rise but it is
likely to exacerbate the impacts of other environmental problems. Careful management of human activities in the affected areas can do a lot to
alleviate the likely effects, but substantial adverse impacts will remain.
In delta regions, which are particularly vulnerable, sea level rise will lead
to substantial loss of agricultural land and salt intrusion into freshwater
resources. In Bangladesh, for instance, over ten million people are likely
to be affected by such loss. A further problem in Bangladesh and other
low-lying tropical areas will be the increased intensity and frequency
of disasters because of storm surges. Each year, the number of people
worldwide experiencing ﬂooding because of storm surges is estimated
now at about forty million. With a 40-cm sea level rise by the 2080s this
number is estimated to quadruple – a number that might be reduced by
half if coastal protection is enhanced in proportion to gross domestic
product (GDP) growth.20 Low-lying small islands will also suffer loss of
land and freshwater supplies. Countries like The Netherlands and many
cities in coastal regions will have to spend substantial sums on protection against the sea. Signiﬁcant amounts of land will also be lost near
the important wetland areas of the world. Attempts to put costs against
these impacts, in both money and human terms, will be considered later
in the chapter.

Increasing human use of fresh water resources

155

In this section we have considered the impacts of sea level rise for the
twenty-ﬁrst century. Because, as we have seen, the ocean takes centuries
to adjust to an increase in surface temperature, the longer-term impacts
of sea level rise also need to be emphasised. Even if the concentrations of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were stabilised so that anthropogenic
climate change is halted, the sea level will continue to rise for many
centuries as the whole ocean adjusts to the new climate.

Increasing human use of fresh water resources
The global water cycle is a fundamental component of the climate system. Water is cycled between the oceans, the atmosphere and the land
surface (Figure 7.5). Through evaporation and condensation it provides
the main means whereby energy is transferred to the atmosphere and
within it. Water is essential to all forms of life; the main reason for the
wide range of life forms, both plant and animal, on the Earth is the
extremely wide range of variation in the availability of water. In wet

tropical forests, the jungle teems with life of enormous variety. In drier
regions sparse vegetation exists, of a kind which can survive for long
periods with the minimum of water; animals there are also well adapted
to dry conditions.
Water is also a key substance for humankind; we need to drink it, we
need it for the production of food, for health and hygiene, for industry and
transport. Humans have learnt that the ways of providing for livelihood
can be adapted to a wide variety of circumstances regarding water supply
except, perhaps, for the completely dry desert. Water availability for
domestic, industrial and agricultural use averaged per capita in different
countries varies from less than 100 m3 (22 000 imperial gallons) per year
to over 100 000 m3 (22 million imperial gallons)21 – although quoting
average numbers of that kind hides the enormous disparity between those
in very poor areas who may walk many hours each day to fetch a few
gallons and many in the developed world who have access to virtually
unlimited supplies at the turn of a tap.
The demands of increased populations and the desire for higher standards of living have brought with them much greater requirements for
fresh water. During the last ﬁfty years water use worldwide has grown
over threefold (Figure 7.6); it now amounts to about ten per cent of the
estimated global total of the river and groundwater ﬂow from land to sea

The impact of climate change on fresh water resources

(Figure 7.5). Two-thirds of human water use is currently for agriculture,
much of it for irrigation; about a quarter is used by industry; only ten
per cent or so is used domestically. Increasingly, water stored over hundreds or thousands of years in underground aquifers is being tapped for
current use. With this rapid growth of demand comes greatly increased
vulnerability regarding water supplies.
The extent to which a country is water stressed is related to the
proportion of the available freshwater supply that is withdrawn for use.
Withdrawal exceeding twenty per cent of renewable water supply has
been used as a threshold of water stress. Under this deﬁnition approximately 1.7 billion people, one-third of the world’s population, live in
water-stressed countries. This number is projected to rise to around ﬁve
billion by 2025, dependent on the rate of population growth, this without
taking into account any effect on water supplies due to climate change.
For instance, in India about seventy-ﬁve per cent of available water is currently used for irrigation. There is therefore very little surplus for future
growth, the only river in north India with a surplus is the Brahmaputra.
Similar situations where nearly all the available water is currently used
prevail in much of central and western Asia.22 Many other developing
countries especially in Africa face similar situations.
A further vulnerability arises because many of the world’s major
sources of water are shared. About half the land area of the world is
within water basins which fall between two or more countries. There are
forty-four countries for which at least eighty per cent of their land areas
falls within such international basins. The Danube, for instance, passes
through twelve countries which use its water, the Nile water through
nine, the Ganges-Bramaputra through ﬁve. Other countries where water
is scarce are critically dependent on sharing the resources of rivers such as
the Euphrates and the Jordan. The achievements of agreements to share
water often bring with them demands for more effective use of the water
and better management. Failure to agree brings increased possibility
of tension and conﬂict. The former United Nations Secretary General,
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has said that ‘The next war in the Middle East
will be fought over water, not politics’.23

The impact of climate change on fresh water
resources
The availability of fresh water will be substantially changed in a world
affected by global warming. We saw in Chapter 6 (Figure 6.5(b)) that,
although there remains substantial uncertainty in model predictions of
precipitation change, it is possible to identify some areas where it is

157

likely that there will be signiﬁcant increases or decreases. For instance,
precipitation is expected to increase in northern high latitudes in winter
and the monsoon regions of south-east Asia in summer, while other
regions (e.g. southern Europe, Central America, southern Africa and
Australia) can expect signiﬁcantly drier summers. Further, increase of
temperature will mean that a higher proportion of the water falling on the
Earth’s surface will evaporate. In regions with increased precipitation,
some or all of the loss due to evaporation may be made up. However, in
regions with unchanged or less precipitation, there will be substantially
less water available at the surface. The combined effect of less rainfall
and more evaporation means less soil moisture available for crop growth
and also less runoff – in regions with marginal rainfall this loss of soil
moisture can be critical.
The runoff in rivers and streams is what is left from the precipitation
that falls on the land after some has been taken by evaporation and by
transpiration from plants; it is the major part of what is available for human use. The amount of runoff is highly sensitive to changes in climate;
even small changes in the amount of precipitation or in the temperature (affecting the amount of evaporation) can have a big inﬂuence on
it. To illustrate this, Figure 7.7 shows simulations, carried out for the
Sacramento Basin in California, USA (a region where water is stored for
some of the year in mountain snow), of changes in runoff with changed
climate conditions. With a 4 ◦ C regional temperature rise and twenty
per cent decreased rainfall, the runoff in the summer months falls to
between twenty per cent and ﬁfty per cent of its normal value. Even with
twenty per cent increased rainfall and the same temperature increase,

The impact of climate change on fresh water resources

summer runoff still remains well below normal. Watersheds in arid or
semi-arid regions are especially sensitive because the annual runoff is in
any case highly variable.
Some watersheds in mid latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, where
snowmelt is an important source of runoff, can also be severely affected.
For these places, as temperatures rise, winter runoff will increase substantially and spring high water will be much reduced. Further, as we
saw earlier in the chapter, up to one-half of the mass of mountain glaciers
and small ice caps may melt away over the next hundred years which
could substantially change the seasonal distribution of river ﬂow and
water supply for hydroelectric generation and agriculture.
A detailed hydrological study of Asia under climate change illustrates the very different impacts on different parts of the continent.24 Projections from a climate model for 2050 under a scenario similar to A1B
were introduced into a hydrological model of different river catchments
and the changes in runoff in the river basins estimated. In arid or semiarid regions of Asia, surface runoff is expected to decrease drastically
so affecting the volume of water available for irrigation and other purposes. Average annual runoff in the basins of the Tigris, Euphrates, Indus
and Brahmaputra rivers was estimated to decline by twenty-two, twentyﬁve, twenty-seven and fourteen per cent respectively. Other areas will
experience substantial increases in runoff, for instance by thirty-seven
and twenty-six per cent, respectively, in the Yangtze (Changjiang) and
Huang He rivers. Substantial increases were also projected for Siberian
rivers.
Watersheds that are particularly vulnerable to climate change can be
identiﬁed by asking certain questions about them.25
r How much water storage is there in the watershed relative to the annual
ﬂow? In Colorado in the United States, for instance, the storage is four
times the annual ﬂow, whereas in the Atlantic States it is only one-tenth
of the annual ﬂow.
r How large is the demand as a percentage of the potential supply? This
varies a great deal. For instance, in North America, for the Rio Grande
and for the lower Colorado demand approximately equals supply and
very little of either of these rivers reaches the sea. Therefore, though
the Colorado has substantial storage and is therefore not very sensitive
to annual variations, the amount of use in its lower reaches means that,
over a number of years, any reduction of its ﬂow is bound to imply
lower water availability.
r How much groundwater is being used? There are many places in the
world where groundwater is being used faster than it is being replenished. To give two examples, for more than half the land area of the

159

160

The impacts of climate change

United States over a quarter of the groundwater withdrawn is not being
replenished, so every year the water has to be extracted from deeper
levels; and in Beijing in China the water table is falling by 2 m a year
as its groundwater is pumped out.
r How variable are the stream and river ﬂows? This question is particularly relevant to arid and semi-arid areas. Detailed studies taking these
criteria into account have been carried out for a number of areas; one
example for the MINK (Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas) region
of the United States is shown in the box.

Study of the ‘MINK’ region in the United States
The United States Department of Energy has carried out a detailed
study26 of the likely effects of climate change on a region (known as the
MINK region) in the centre of the United States comprising the states
of Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas. Included within the region are
parts of four major river basins – the Missouri, the Arkansas, the Upper
and the Lower Mississippi. Water is already a scarce resource within
the MINK states; much of the area’s irrigation relies on non-renewable
groundwater supplies. These will diminish with time, so that even in the
absence of climate change less water will be available, especially for
irrigation.
To provide an analogue of the climate which might be expected with
increased carbon dioxide, the period of the 1930s was chosen, when the
average temperature in the region was about 1 ◦ C warmer than in the
period 1950–1980 (the ‘control’ period) and the average precipitation
about ten per cent lower than in the control period.
Water would become scarcer under the analogue climate compared
with the control.27 The hotter and drier conditions would increase evaporation and reduce runoff. Streamﬂow would drop by about thirty per cent
in the Missouri and the Upper Mississippi basins and by about ten per cent
in the Arkansas. Most streams would fall well short of supplying both
the desired instream ﬂows and the current levels of consumption use.
Under the analogue climate, irrigated agriculture would be bound
to decline substantially because of the increased constraints on groundwater use coupled with less water availability from other sources. This
would also result in a drive to increased efﬁciency, albeit at greater cost.
Maintaining the high priority currently given to navigation on the main
stem of the Missouri would become very costly.

So far when mentioning changes in temperature or rainfall it is
changes in the average with which we have been concerned; for instance, the simulations in Figure 7.7 are for average conditions. But,
as has been constantly emphasised, the severity of climate impacts

The impact of climate change on fresh water resources

depends to a great degree on extreme conditions. This is well illustrated by looking at the scale of natural disasters involving water – either
too much water in ﬂoods or too little in droughts. Some of the most
damaging ﬂoods of recent years were mentioned in Chapter 1 (page 5)
– see also Table 7.3 (page 183). Droughts do not appear high up on the
table of natural disasters, not because they are unimportant, but because,
unlike most other disasters, their effects tend to be felt over a long period of time. The ‘dust bowl’ years in the 1930s in the United States
are still within living memory, as are the droughts and famines in India
in 1965–7 which, it is estimated, claimed one and a half million lives.
Recent decades have seen a series of damaging droughts in the Sahel
region and in other parts of Africa28 – which are still recurring only too
frequently on that continent.
Any temperature or rainfall record shows a large variability. The
inevitable result of variability added to higher average temperatures
(meaning higher evaporation) and higher average rainfall will be a greater
number and greater intensity of both droughts and ﬂoods.29 For instance,
associated with the substantial changes in average runoff expected by
2050 in parts of Asia mentioned above will be increases in the number and intensity of ﬂoods and droughts. Some of the areas likely to be
affected are just those areas that are particularly vulnerable at the moment – although, as was also implied in Chapter 6, droughts and ﬂoods
are increasingly likely to occur in some locations where, at present, such
disasters are rare. Very few quantitative estimates have been made of the
likely increase in ﬂoods or droughts as a result of the increase of greenhouse gases. One estimate quoted in Chapter 6 (page 131) projected an
increase of a factor of ﬁve in intense precipitation events in parts of
Europe under a doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration.
The monsoon regions of southeast Asia are an example of an area that
may be particularly vulnerable to both ﬂoods and droughts. Figure 7.8
shows the predicted change in summer precipitation over the Indian subcontinent as simulated by a regional climate model (RCM) for 2050
under a scenario similar to SRES A1B. Note the improvement in detail
of the precipitation pattern that results from the use of the increased
resolution of the regional model compared with the global model
(GCM), for instance over the Western Ghats (the mountains that rise
steeply from India’s west coast) there are large increases not present
in the global model simulation. The most serious reductions in water
availability simulated by the regional model are in the arid regions of
northwest India and Pakistan where average precipitation is reduced to
less than 1 mm day−1 – that coupled with higher temperatures leads to a
sixty per cent decline in soil moisture. Substantial increases in average
precipitation are projected for areas in eastern India and in ﬂood-prone

Bangladesh where the projected increase is about twenty per cent. What
is urgently required for this part of the world and elsewhere is much
better information linking changes in average parameters with likely
changes in frequency, intensity and location of extreme events.
There is another reason, not unconnected with global warming, for
the vulnerability of water supplies: the link between rainfall and changes
in land use. Extensive deforestation can lead to large changes in rainfall
(see box on page 173). A similar tendency to reduced rainfall can be
expected if there is a reduction in vegetation over large areas of semiarid regions. Such changes can have a devastating and widespread effect
and assist in the process of desertiﬁcation. This is a potential threat to
the drylands covering about one-quarter of the land area of the world
(see box on page 163).
What sort of action can be taken to lessen the vulnerability of human communities to changes in water availability or supply? Irrigation
accounts for about two-thirds of world water use, and is of great importance to world agriculture. Irrigation is applied to about one-sixth
of the world’s farmland, which produces about one-third of the world’s
crops. In some areas the ratio is much higher; for instance, over eighty
per cent of the agricultural land in California is irrigated. Most irrigation is through open ditches, which is very wasteful of water; over sixty
per cent is lost through evaporation and seepage. Microirrigation techniques, in which perforated pipes deliver water directly to the plants,
provide large opportunities for water conservation, making it possible
to expand irrigated ﬁelds without building new dams.30 Management of
the existing infrastructure can be improved, for instance by arranging for
the integration of different supplies, and conservation in the domestic
and industrial sectors can be encouraged. Most of these actions will cost

The impact of climate change on fresh water resources

Desertiﬁcation
Drylands (deﬁned as those areas where precipitation is low and where
rainfall typically consists of small, erratic, short, high-intensity storms)
cover about forty per cent of the total land area of the world and support
over one-ﬁfth of the world’s population. Figure 7.9 shows how these arid
areas are distributed over the continents.
Desertiﬁcation in these drylands is the degradation of land brought
about by climate variations or human activities that have led to decreased
vegetation, reduction of available water, reduction of crop yields and erosion of soil. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation
(UNCCD) set up in 1996 estimates that over seventy per cent of these
drylands, covering over twenty-ﬁve per cent of the world’s land area, are
degraded33 and therefore affected by desertiﬁcation. The degradation can
be exacerbated by excessive land use or increased human needs (generally because of increased population), or political or economic pressures
(for instance, the need to grow cash crops to raise foreign currency). It
is often triggered or intensiﬁed by a naturally occurring drought.
The progress of desertiﬁcation in some of the drylands will be increased by the more frequent or more intense droughts that are likely to
result from climate change during the twenty-ﬁrst century.

drylands is about sixty million square kilometres (about forty per cent of
the total land area), of which ten million are hyper-arid deserts.

money, although they may be much more cost-effective ways of coping
with future change in water resources than attempting to develop major
new facilities.31
In summary, what are the likely effects of global warming on water
supplies? Firstly, the current vulnerability of many communities to water
shortage should be noted. This is especially true of arid and semi-arid
regions where the increasing demands of human communities mean
that droughts, even for short periods, are more disastrous than before.
Vulnerability is well demonstrated in many areas of the world where the
amounts of groundwater extraction greatly exceed its replenishment – a
situation that cannot continue for very long into the future. Because of
population growth these vulnerabilities will increase and will exacerbate
the negative effects of global warming.
Secondly, climate change because of global warming will result in
large changes in water supplies in many places. Although the present state
of knowledge regarding regional and local climate change does not allow
scientists to identify precisely the most vulnerable areas, they are able
to indicate the sort of area which will be most affected. Such areas are
those arid and semi-arid areas with reduced rainfall leading to greater
aridity and even desertiﬁcation; continental areas where decreased summer rainfall and increased temperature result in a substantial loss in soil
moisture and much increased vulnerability to drought; and areas where
increased rainfall could lead to a greater incidence of ﬂoods. The changing pattern of climate extremes, especially droughts and ﬂoods, will be
the cause of most of the problems. It is also the case that regions such
as southeast Asia that are dependent on unregulated river systems are
more sensitive to change than regions such as western Russia and the
western United States that have large, regulated water resource systems.
Thirdly, some of the adverse impact of climate change on water supplies
can be reduced by taking appropriate alleviating action, by introducing
more careful and integrated water management32 and by introducing
more effective disaster preparedness in the most vulnerable areas.

Impact on agriculture and food supply
Every farmer understands the need to grow crops or rear animals that are
suited to the local climate. The distribution of temperature and rainfall
during the year are key factors in making decisions regarding what crops
to grow. These will change in the world inﬂuenced by global warming. The patterns of what crops are grown where will therefore also
change. But these changes will be complex; economic and other factors
will take their place alongside climate change in the decision-making
process.

Impact on agriculture and food supply

There is enormous capacity for adaptation in the growth of crops for
food – as is illustrated by what was called the Green Revolution of the
1960s, when the development of new strains of many species of crops
resulted in large increases in productivity. Between the mid 1960s and
the mid 1980s global food production rose by an average annual rate
of 2.4% – faster than global population – more than doubling over that
thirty-year period. Grain production grew even faster, at an annual rate
of 2.9%.34 There are concerns that factors such as the degradation of
many of the world’s soils largely through erosion and the slowed rate of
expansion of irrigation because less fresh water is available will tend to
reduce the potential for increased agricultural production in the future.
However, with declining rates of population growth, there remains optimism that, in the absence of major climate change, the growth in world
food supply is likely to continue to match the growth in demand at least
during the early decades of the twenty-ﬁrst century.35
What will be the effect of climate change on agriculture and food supply? With the detailed knowledge of the conditions required by different
species and the expertise in breeding techniques and genetic manipulation available today, there should be little difﬁculty in matching crops to
new climatic conditions over large parts of the world. At least, that is the
case for crops that mature over a year or two. Forests reach maturity over
much longer periods, from decades up to a century or even more. The
projected rate of climate change is such that, during this time, trees may
ﬁnd themselves in a climate to which they are far from suited. The temperature regime or the rainfall may be substantially changed, resulting in
stunted growth or a greater susceptibility to disease and pests. The impact of climate change on forests is considered in more detail in the next
section.
An example of adaptation to changing climate is the way in which
farmers in Peru adjust the crops they grow depending on the climate
forecast for the year.36 Peru is a country whose climate is strongly inﬂuenced by the cycle of El Ni˜no events described in Chapters 1 and 5. Two
of the primary crops grown in Peru, rice and cotton, are very sensitive
to the amount and the timing of rainfall. Rice requires large amounts
of water; cotton has deeper roots and is capable of yielding greater production during years of low rainfall. In 1983, following the 1982–3 El
Ni˜no event, agricultural production dropped by fourteen per cent. By
1987 forecasts of the onset of El Ni˜no events had become sufﬁciently
good for Peruvian farmers to take them into account in their planning.
In 1987, following the 1986–7 El Ni˜no, production actually increased
by three per cent, thanks to a useful forecast.
Three factors are particularly important in considering the effect
of climate change on agriculture and food production. The availability

165

166

The impacts of climate change

of water is the most important of the factors. The vulnerability of water
supplies to climate change carries over into a vulnerability in the growing
of crops and the production of food. Thus the arid or semi-arid areas,
mostly in developing countries, are most at risk. A second factor, which
tends to lead to increased production as a result of climate change, is the
boost to growth that is given, particularly to some crops, by increased
atmospheric carbon dioxide (see box below). A third factor is the effect of
temperature changes; in particular, under very high temperatures, yields
of some crops are substantially reduced.

The carbon dioxide ‘fertilisation’ effect
An important positive effect of increased carbon dioxide (CO2 ) concentrations in the atmosphere is the boost to growth in plants given by
the additional CO2 . Higher CO2 concentrations stimulate photosynthesis, enabling the plants to ﬁx carbon at a higher rate. This is why in
glasshouses additional CO2 may be introduced artiﬁcially to increase
productivity. The effect is particularly applicable to what are called C3
plants (such as wheat, rice and soya bean), but less so to C4 plants (for
example, maize, sorghum, sugar-cane, millet and many pasture and forage grasses). Under ideal conditions it can be a large effect; for C3 crops
under doubled CO2 , an average of +30%.37 However, under real conditions on the large scale where water and nutrient availability are also
important factors inﬂuencing plant growth, experiments show that the
increases, although difﬁcult to measure accurately, tend to be substantially less than the ideal.38 In experimental work, grain and forage quality
declines with CO2 enrichment and higher temperatures. More research
is required especially for many tropical crop species and for crops grown
under suboptimal conditions (low nutrients, weeds, pests and diseases).

Detailed studies have been carried out of the sensitivity to climate
change during the twenty-ﬁrst century of the major crops which make up
a large proportion of the world’s food supply (see box below). They have
used the results of climate models to estimate changes in temperature
and precipitation. Many of them study the effect of CO2 fertilisation and
some also model the effects of climate variability as well as changes in
the means. Some also include the possible effects of economic factors
and of modest levels of adaptation. These studies in general indicate that
the beneﬁt of increased CO2 concentration on crop growth and yield does
not always overcome the effects of excessive heat and drought. For cereal
crops in mid latitudes, potential yields are projected to increase for small

Impact on agriculture and food supply

increases in temperature (2–3 ◦ C) but decrease for larger temperature
rises.39 In most tropical and subtropical regions, potential yields are projected to decrease for most increases in temperature; this is because
such crops are near their maximum temperature tolerance. Where there
is a large decrease in rainfall, tropical crop yields would be even
more adversely affected.
Taking the supply of food for the world as a whole, studies tend to
show that, with appropriate adaptation, the effect of climate change on
total global food supply is not likely to be large. However, none of them
have adequately taken into account the likely effect on food production of
climate extremes (especially of the incidence of drought), of increasingly
limited water availability or of other factors such as the integrity of the
world’s soils, which are currently being degraded at an alarming rate.40
A serious issue exposed by the studies is that climate change is likely
to affect countries very differently. Production in developed countries
with relatively stable populations may increase, whereas that in many
developing countries (where large increases in population are occurring)
is likely to decline as a result of climate change. The disparity between
developed and developing nations will tend to become much larger,
as will the number of those at risk from hunger. The surplus of food in
developed countries is likely to increase, while developing countries will
face increasing deprivation as their declining food availability becomes
much less able to provide for the needs of their increasing populations.
Such a situation will raise enormous problems, one of which will be
that of employment. Agriculture is the main source of employment in
developing countries; people need employment to be able to buy food.
With changing climate, as some agricultural regions shift, people will
tend to attempt to migrate to places where they might be employed in
agriculture. With the pressures of rising populations, such movement is
likely to be increasingly difﬁcult and we can expect large numbers of
environmental refugees.
In looking to future needs, two activities that can be pursued now
are particularly important. Firstly, there is large need for technical advances in agriculture in developing countries requiring investment and
widespread local training. In particular, there needs to be continued development of programmes for crop breeding and management, especially
in conditions of heat and drought. These can be immediately useful in the
improvement of productivity in marginal environments today. Secondly,
as was seen earlier when considering fresh water supplies, improvements
need to be made in the availability and management of water for irrigation, especially in arid or semi-arid areas of the world.

The impacts of climate change

Modelling the impact of climate change on world
food supply
An example illustrating the key elements of a detailed study of the impact
of climate change on world food supply is shown in Figure 7.10.41
A climate change scenario is ﬁrst set up with a climate model of
the kind described in Chapter 5. Models of different crops that include
the effects of temperature, precipitation and CO2 are applied to 124
different locations in 18 countries to produce projected crop yields that
can be compared with projected yields in the absence of climate change.
Included also are farm-level adaptations, e.g. planting date shifts, more
climatically adapted varieties, irrigation and fertiliser application. These
estimates of yield are then aggregated to provide yield-change estimates
by crop and country or region.
These yield changes are then employed as inputs to a world food
trade model that includes assumptions about global parameters such
as population growth and economic change and links together national
and regional economic models for the agricultural sector through trade,
world market prices and ﬁnancial ﬂows. The world food trade model
can explore the effects of adjustments such as increased agricultural investment, reallocation of agricultural resources according to economic
returns (including crop switching) and reclamation of additional arable
land as a response to higher cereal prices. The outputs from the total process provide information projected up to the 2080s on food production,
food prices and the number of people at risk of hunger (deﬁned as the
population with an income insufﬁcient either to produce or to procure
their food requirements).
The main results with this model for the 2080s regarding the impact
of climate change following the IS 92a scenario (Figure 6.1) are that
yields at mid to high latitudes are expected to increase, and at low latitudes (especially the arid and sub-humid tropics) to decrease. This pattern
becomes more pronounced as time progresses. The African continent is
particularly likely to experience marked reductions in yield, decreases
in production and an estimated sixty million or more additional people
at risk of hunger as a result of climate change.
The authors emphasise that, although the models and the methods
they have employed are comparatively complex, there are many factors that have not been taken into account. For instance, they have not
adequately considered the impact of changes in climate extremes, the
availability of water supplies for irrigation or the effects of future technological change on agricultural productivity. Further (see Chapter 6),
scientists are not yet very conﬁdent in the regional detail of climate
change. The results, therefore, although giving a general indication of
the changes that could occur, should not be treated as a detailed prediction. They highlight the importance of studies of this kind as a guide to
future action.

The impacts of climate change

The impact on ecosystems
A little over ten per cent of the world’s land area is under cultivation –
that was the area addressed in the last section. The rest is to a greater
or lesser extent unmanaged by humans. Of this about thirty per cent
is natural forest and between one and two per cent plantation forest.
The variety of plants and animals that constitute a local ecosystem is
sensitive to the climate, the type of soil and the availability of water.
Ecologists divide the world into biomes – regions characterised by their
distinctive vegetation. This is well illustrated by information about the
distribution of vegetation over the world during past climates (e.g. for
the part of North America shown in Figure 7.11), which indicates what
species and what ecosystems are most likely to ﬂourish under different
climatic regimes.
Changes in climate alter the suitability of a region for different
species, and change their competitiveness within an ecosystem, so that
even relatively small changes in climate will lead, over time, to large
changes in the composition of an ecosystem. Since climate is the dominant factor determining the distribution of biomes (Figure 7.12), information gleaned from paleo sources could be used to produce maps of the
optimum distribution of natural vegetation under the climate scenarios
expected to occur with global warming.
However, changes of the kind illustrated in Figure 7.11 took place
over thousands of years. With global warming similar changes in climate
occur over a few decades. Most ecosystems cannot respond or migrate
that fast. Fossil records indicate that the maximum rate at which most
plant species have migrated in the past is about 1 km per year. Known
constraints imposed by the dispersal process (e.g. the mean period between germination and the production of seeds and the mean distance that
an individual seed can travel) suggest that, without human intervention,
many species would not be able to keep up with the rate of movement of
their preferred climate niche projected for the twenty-ﬁrst century, even
if there were no barriers to their movement imposed by land use.42 Natural ecosystems will therefore become increasingly unmatched to their
environment. How much this matters will vary from species to species:
some are more vulnerable to changes in average climate or climate extremes than others. But all will become more prone to disease and attack
by pests. Any positive effect from added ‘fertilisation’ due to increased
carbon dioxide is likely to be more than outweighed by negative effects
from other factors.
Trees are long-lived and take a long time to reproduce, so they cannot
respond quickly to climate change. Further, many trees are surprisingly
sensitive to the average climate in which they develop. The environmental

conditions (e.g. temperature and precipitation) under which a species can
exist and reproduce are known as its niche. Climate niches for some typical tree species are illustrated in Figure 7.13; under some conditions
a change as small as 1 ◦ C in annual average temperature can make a
substantial difference to a tree’s productivity. For the likely changes in
climate in the twenty-ﬁrst century, a substantial proportion of existing
trees will be subject to unsuitable climate conditions. This will be particularly the case in the boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere where,
as trees become less healthy, they will be more prone to pests, die-back
and forest ﬁres. One estimate projects that, under a doubled CO2 scenario, up to sixty-ﬁve per cent of the current boreal forested area could
be affected.43
A decline in the health of many forests in recent years has received
considerable attention, especially in Europe and North America where
much of it has been attributed to acid rain and other pollution originating

The impact on ecosystems

173

Forests, deforestation and climate change
Extensive changes in the area of forests due to deforestation can seriously affect the climate in the
region of change. Also, changes in temperature or
rainfall that occur because of long-term changes in
climate can also have a major impact on forests. We
look at these effects in turn.
Changes in land use such as those brought about
by deforestation can affect the amount of rainfall,
for three main reasons. Over a forest there is a lot
more evaporation of water (through the leaves of
the trees) than there is over grassland or bare soil,
hence the air will contain more water vapour. Also,
a forest reﬂects twelve to ﬁfteen per cent of the sunlight that falls on it, whereas grassland will reﬂect
about twenty per cent and desert sand up to forty
per cent. A third reason arises from the roughness
of the surface where vegetation is present.
An American meteorologist, Professor Jules
Charney, suggested in 1975 that, in the context of
the drought in the Sahel, there could be an important link between changes of vegetation (and hence
changes of reﬂectivity) and rainfall. The increased
energy absorbed at the surface when vegetation is
present and the increased surface roughness both
tend to stimulate convection and other dynamic activity in the atmosphere so leading to the production
of rainfall.
Early experiments with numerical models that
included these physical processes demonstrated the
effect and indicated, for instance, a reduction of
about ﬁfteen per cent in rainfall if the forest north of
30 ◦ S in South America were removed and replaced
by grassland.44 Similar model experiments for Zaire
over a smaller region showed an average reduction

in rainfall of over thirty per cent.45 A much more
drastic experiment in which the Amazonian forest
was removed and replaced with a desert surface
showed a reduction in rainfall by seventy per cent
to levels similar to those of the semi-arid regions
of the Sahel part of Africa.46 Such a model experiment does not represent a realistic situation, but
it illustrates the signiﬁcant impact that widespread
deforestation could have on the local climate.
More recent work has been with interactive
models that include not just the effect of changes
in land use or forestation on the climate but also,
in a dynamic way, the effect on forests and other
vegetation of changes in climate. In an experiment
with such a model that assumes carbon dioxide
emissions following the IS 92a scenario,47 substantial reductions in precipitation are projected for
areas of Amazonia, that lead to die-back of the
Amazonian forest and signiﬁcant release of carbon
to the atmosphere (one of the positive climate feedbacks mentioned in the box on page 40). As the
forest dies back, the rainfall is further reduced because of the change in properties of the land surface, leading, by the end of the twenty-ﬁrst century,
to the replacement of much of the forest cover by
semi-arid conditions. Such results are still subject
to considerable uncertainties (for instance, those
associated with the model simulations of El Ni˜no
events under climate change conditions and the connections between these events and the climate over
Amazonia), but they illustrate the type of impacts
that might occur and emphasise the importance of
understanding the interactions between climate and
vegetation.

from heavy industry, power stations and motor cars. Not all damage to
trees, however, is thought to have this origin. Studies in several regions
of Canada, for instance, indicate that the die-back of trees there is related
to changes in climatic conditions, especially to successions of warmer
winters and drier summers.48 In some cases it may be the double effect of
pollution and climate stress causing the problem; trees already weakened

by the effects of pollution fail to cope with climate stress when it comes.
The assessment of the impact of climate change carried out for the MINK
region of the United States (see box on page 160) concluded that, under
the warmer, drier conditions of the analogue climate they studied, decline
and die-back of the forested part of the region would reduce the mass of
timber in the forest by ten per cent over twenty years.49 The results of

The impact on ecosystems

these studies are indicative of the more serious levels of forest die-back
that are likely to occur with the rapid rate of climate change expected
with global warming (see box on page 173).These stresses on the world’s
forests due to climate change will be concurrent with other problems
associated with forests, in particular those of continuing tropical deforestation and of increasing demand for wood and wood products resulting
from rapidly increasing populations especially in developing countries.
If a stable climate is eventually re-established, given adequate time
(which could be centuries), different trees will be able to ﬁnd again at
some location their particular climatic niche. It is during the period of
rapid change that most trees will ﬁnd themselves unsatisfactorily located
from the climate point of view.
It was mentioned in Chapter 3 that forests represent a large store of
carbon; eighty per cent of above-ground and forty per cent of belowground terrestrial carbon is in forests. We also saw in Chapter 3 that
tropical deforestation due to human activities is probably releasing between 1 and 2 Gt of carbon into the atmosphere each year. If, because
of the rate of climate change, substantial stress and die-back occurs in
boreal and tropical forests (see box on page 173) a release of carbon will
occur. This positive feedback was mentioned in Chapter 3 (see the box
on page 40). Just how large this will be is uncertain but estimates as high
as 240 Gt over the twenty-ﬁrst century for the above-ground component
alone have been quoted.50
The above discussion has largely related to the impact of climate
change on natural forests where the likely impacts are largely negative.
Studies of the impacts on managed forests are more positive.51 They suggest that with appropriate adaptation and land and product management,
even without forestry projects that increase the capture and storage of
carbon (see Chapter 10), a small amount of climate change could increase global timber supply and enhance existing market trends towards
rising market share in developing countries.
A further concern about natural ecosystems relates to the diversity of
species that they contain and the loss of species and hence of biodiversity
due to the impact of climate change. Signiﬁcant disruptions of ecosystems from disturbances such as ﬁre, drought, pest infestation, invasion of
species, storms and coral bleaching events are expected to increase. The
stresses caused by climate change, added to other stresses on ecological
systems (e.g. land conversion, land degradation, deforestation, harvesting and pollution) threaten substantial damage to or complete loss of
some unique ecosystems, and the extinction of some endangered species.
Coral reefs and atolls, mangroves, boreal and tropical forests, polar and
alpine ecosystems, prairie wetlands and remnant native grasslands are
examples of systems threatened by climate change. In some cases the

175

176

The impacts of climate change

threatened ecosystems are those that could mitigate against some climate
change impacts (e.g. coastal systems that buffer the impact of storms).
Possible adaptation methods to reduce the loss of biodiversity include
the establishment of refuges, parks and reserves with corridors to allow
migration of species, and the use of captive breeding and translocation
of species.52
So far we have been considering ecosystems on land. What about
those in the oceans; how will they be affected by climate change? Although we know much less about ocean ecosystems, there is considerable
evidence that biological activity in the oceans has varied during the cycle
of ice ages. Chapter 3 noted (see box on page 35) the likelihood that it
was these variations in marine biological activity which provided the
main control on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations during the
past million years (see Figure 4.4). The changes in ocean water temperature and the possible changes in some of the patterns of ocean circulation
are likely to result in changes in the regions where upwelling occurs and
where ﬁsh congregate. Some ﬁsheries could collapse and others expand.
At the moment the ﬁshing industry is not well adapted to address major
change.53
Some of the most important marine ecosystems are found within
coral reefs that occur in many locations throughout the tropical and
subtropical world. They are especially rich in biodiversity and are particularly threatened by global warming. Within them the species diversity contains more phyla than rainforests and they harbour more than
twenty-ﬁve per cent of all known marine ﬁsh.54 They represent a significant source of food for many coastal communities. Corals are particularly sensitive to sea surface temperature and even one degree Celsius
of persistent warming can cause bleaching (paling in colour) and extensive mortality accompanies persistent temperature anomalies of 3 ◦ C
or more. Much recent bleaching, for instance that in 1998, have been
associated with El Ni˜no events.55

The impact on human health
Human health is dependent on a good environment. Many of the factors
that lead to a deteriorated environment also lead to poor health. Pollution
of the atmosphere, polluted or inadequate water supplies, and poor soil
(leading to poor crops and inadequate nutrition) all present dangers to
human health and wellbeing and assist the spread of disease. As has
been seen so far in considering the impacts of global warming, many
of these factors will tend to be exacerbated through the climate change
that will occur in the warmer world. The greater likelihood of extremes
of climate, such as droughts and ﬂoods, will also bring greater risks to

The impact on human health

177

health from increased malnutrition and from a prevalence of conditions
more likely to lead to the spread of diseases from a variety of causes.
How about direct effects of the climate change itself on human
health?56 Humans can adapt themselves and their buildings so as to live
satisfactorily in very varying conditions and have great ability to adapt to
a wide range of climates. The main difﬁculty in assessing the impact of
climate change on health is that of unravelling the inﬂuences of climate
from the large number of other factors (including other environmental
factors) that affect health.
The main direct effect on humans will be that of heat stress in the
extreme high temperatures that will become more frequent and more
widespread especially in urban populations (see box and Figure 6.6). In
large cities where heat waves commonly occur death rates can be doubled
or tripled during days of unusually high temperatures.57 Although such
episodes may be followed by periods with fewer deaths showing that
some of the deaths would in any case have occurred about that time,
most of the increased mortality seems to be directly associated with the
excessive temperatures with which old people in particular ﬁnd it hard
to cope. On the positive side, mortality due to periods of severe cold in
winter will be reduced. The results of studies are equivocal regarding

Heat waves in Europe, 2003
Record extreme temperatures were experienced in Europe during June,
July and August 2003. At many locations temperature rose over 40 ◦ C.
In France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain, over 21 000 additional deaths were attributed to the unrelenting heat. Spain, Portugal,
France and countries in Central and Eastern Europe suffered from intense forest ﬁres.58 Figure 7.14 illustrates the extreme rareness of this
event.

whether the reduction in winter mortality will be greater or less than
the increase in summer mortality. These studies have largely been conﬁned to populations in developed countries, precluding a more general
comparison between changes in summer and winter mortality.
A further likely impact of climate change on health is the increased
spreading of diseases in a warmer world. Many insect carriers of disease thrive better in warmer and wetter conditions. For instance, epidemics of diseases such as viral encephalitides carried by mosquitoes
are known to be associated with the unusually wet conditions that occur in the Australian, American and African continents associated with
different phases of the El Ni˜no cycle.59 Some diseases, currently largely
conﬁned to tropical regions, with warmer conditions could spread into
mid latitudes. Malaria is an example of such a disease that is spread
by mosquitoes under conditions which are optimum in the temperature range of 15–32 ◦ C with humidities of ﬁfty to sixty per cent. It
currently represents a huge global public health problem, causing annually around 300 million new infections and over one million deaths.
Under climate change scenarios, most predictive model studies indicate a net increase in the geographic range (and in the populations at
risk) of potential transmission of malaria and dengue infections, each
of which currently impinge on forty to ﬁfty per cent of the world’s
population. Other diseases that are likely to spread for the same reason are yellow fever and some viral encephalitis. In all cases, however, actual disease occurrence will be strongly inﬂuenced by local environmental conditions, socio-economic circumstances and public health
infrastructure.
The potential impact of climate change on human health could be
large. However, the factors involved are highly complex; any quantitative conclusions will require careful study of the direct effects of
climate on humans and of the epidemiology of the diseases that are
likely to be particularly affected. Some remarks about how the health
impacts of extremes and disasters might be reduced are given in the next
section.

Adaptation to climate change
As we have seen, some of the impacts of climate change are already
becoming apparent. A degree of adaptation therefore has already become a necessity. Numerous possible adaptation options for responding
to climate change have already been identiﬁed. These can reduce adverse impacts and enhance beneﬁcial effects of climate change and can
also produce immediate ancillary beneﬁts, but they cannot prevent all

Costing the impacts: extreme events

damages. Examples of adaptation options are listed in Table 7.1. Many
of the options listed are presently employed to cope with current climate
variability and extremes; their expanded use can enhance both current
and future capacity to cope. But such actions may not be as effective in
the future as the amount and rate of climate change increase. To make
a list of possible adaptation options is relatively easy. If they are to be
applied effectively, much more information is urgently required regarding the detail and the cost of their application over the wide range of
circumstances where they will be required.
Of particular importance is the requirement for adaptation to extreme events and disasters such as ﬂoods, droughts and severe storms.60
Vulnerability to such events can be substantially reduced by much more
adequate preparation.61 For instance, following hurricanes George and
Mitch, the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) identiﬁed a range
of policies to reduce the impact of such events62 :
r Undertaking vulnerability studies of existing water supply and sanitation systems and ensuring that new systems are built to reduce vulnerability.
r Developing and improving training programmes and information systems for national programmes and international cooperation on emergency management.
r Developing and testing early warning systems that should be coordinated by a single national agency and involve vulnerable communities.
Provision is also required for providing and evaluating mental care,
particularly for those who may be especially vulnerable to the adverse
psychosocial effects of disasters (e.g. children, the elderly and the
bereaved).

Costing the impacts: extreme events
In the previous paragraphs the impacts of climate change have been
described in terms of a variety of measures; for instance, the number of
people affected (e.g. by mortality, disease or by being displaced), the gain
or loss of agricultural or forest productivity, the loss of biodiversity, the
increase in desertiﬁcation, etc. However, the most widespread measure,
looked for by many policymakers, is monetary cost or beneﬁt. But before
describing what has been done so far to estimate the overall costs of
impacts, we need to consider what is known about the cost of damage
due to extreme events (such as ﬂoods, droughts or windstorms). As has
been constantly emphasised in this chapter these probably constitute the
most important element in climate change impacts.

The impacts of climate change

See Table 3.6 on p. 76 of Watson, R. et al. (eds.) 2001, Climate Change 2001: Synthesis Report.

Because the incidence of such extreme events has increased signiﬁcantly in recent decades, information about the cost of the damage due
to them has been tracked by insurance companies. They have catalogued
both the insured losses and, so far as they have been able to estimate, the
total economic losses – these latter have shown an approximately tenfold
increase from the 1950s to the 1990s (see Figure 1.2 and box below).
Although factors other than climate change have contributed to this increase, climate change is probably the factor of most signiﬁcance. The
estimates for the 1990s of annual economic losses from weather-related

Costing the impacts: extreme events

disasters amount to approximately 0.2% of global world product (GWP)
and vary from about 0.3% of aggregate GDPs for the North and Central
American and the Asian regions to less than 0.1% for Africa (Table 7.2).
These average ﬁgures hide big regional and temporal variations. For instance, the annual loss in China from natural disasters from 1989 to 1996
is estimated to range from three to six per cent of GDP, averaging nearly
four per cent63 – over ten times the world average. The reason why the
percentage for Africa is so low is not because there are no disasters there –
Africa on the whole has more than its fair share – but because most of the
damage in African disasters is not realised in economic terms, nor does
it appear in economic statistics. Further such averaged numbers hide the
severe impact of disasters on individual countries or regions which, as
we mention below with the example of Hurricane Mitch, can prove to
be very large indeed.
The percentages we have quoted are conservative in that they do not
represent all relevant costs. They relate to direct economic costs only and
do not include associated or knock-on costs of disasters. This means, for
instance, that the damage due to droughts is seriously underestimated.
Droughts tend to happen slowly and many of the losses may not be
recorded or borne by those not directly affected. Another reason for
treating the information in the box with caution is because of the large
disparities between different parts of the world and countries regarding
per capita wealth, standard of living and degree of insurance cover. For
instance, probably the most damaging hurricane ever, Hurricane Mitch,
that hit Central America in 1998 does not appear in Table 7.3 as the total
insured losses were less than one billion dollars. In that storm, 600 mm
of rainfall fell in forty-eight hours, there were 9000 deaths and economic
losses estimated at over six billion dollars. The losses in Honduras and
Nicaragua amounted to about seventy and forty-ﬁve per cent respectively
of their annual gross national product (GNP). Another example that does
not appear in Table 7.3 for the same reason is the ﬂoods in central Europe
in 1997 that caused the evacuation of 162 000 people and over ﬁve billion
dollars of economic damage.
How about the likely costs of extreme events in the future? To estimate those we need much more quantitative information about their
likely future incidence and intensity. Very few such estimates exist. One
was mentioned in Chapter 6 (Figure 6.8) – a possible factor of ﬁve
in extreme precipitation events in Europe under doubled pre-industrial
carbon dioxide concentration. A speculative but probably conservative
calculation of a global average ﬁgure for the future might be obtained as
follows. Beginning with the 0.2% or 0.3% of GDP from the insurance
companies’ estimate of the current average costs due to weather-related

Table 7.2 Fatalities, economic losses and insured losses (both in 1999 US dollars) for disasters in different regions as
estimated by the insurance industry for the period 1985–99. The percentage from weather-related disasters (including
windstorms, ﬂoods, droughts, wildﬁre, landslides, land subsidence, avalanches, extreme temperature events, lightning,
frost and ice/snow damages) is indicated in each case. Total losses are higher than those summarised in Figure 1.2
because of the restriction of Figure 1.2 to losses from large catastrophic events

The insurance industry and climate change
The impact of climate on the insurance industry is
mainly through extreme weather events. In developing countries there may be very high mortality
from extreme weather but relatively small costs
to the industry because of low insurance penetration. In developed countries the loss of life may
be much less but the costs to the insurance industry can be very large. Figure 1.2 illustrates the
large growth in weather-related disasters and the
associated economic and insured losses since the
1950s and Table 7.2 the distribution of the disasters,
fatalities and economic losses from 1985 to 1999
around the continents. Some idea of the types of
disaster that cause the largest economic loss can be
gleaned from Table 7.3.
Part of the observed upward trend in historical
disaster losses is linked to socio-economic factors
such as population growth, increased wealth and
urbanisation in vulnerable areas; part is linked to

climatic factors such as changes in precipitation,
ﬂooding and drought events. There are differences
in balance between the causes by region and type
of event. Because of the complexities involved in
delineating both the socio-economic and the climatic factors, the proportion of the contribution
from human-induced climate change cannot be deﬁned with any certainty – although it is interesting to note that the growth rate in damage cost of
weather-related events was three times that of nonweather-related events for the period 1960–99.
Recent history has shown that weather-related
losses can stress insurers to the point of bankruptcy.
Hurricane Andrew in 1992 broke the twenty billion dollar barrier for insured loss and served as a
wake-up call to the industry. The insurance industry, therefore, is very concerned to make estimates,
as accurately as possible, for future trends as the
rate of climate change increases.

The impacts of climate change

extreme events, then multiplying by two to allow for the factors mentioned above (e.g. associated or knock-on costs) and further multiplying
by three to allow for the possible increase in extreme events, say by
the middle of the twenty-ﬁrst century, we end up with a ﬁgure of between one and two per cent of GDP. Further, this again is a ‘money’
estimate. The real total costs of extreme events taking into account all
damages (including those that cannot be expressed in money terms)
are likely to be very signiﬁcantly larger especially in many developing
countries.

Costing the total impacts
We now turn to consider all the impacts of anthropogenic climate
change, attempts that have been made to express their cost in monetary
terms and the validity of the methods employed. The IPCC 1995 Report
contained a review of four cost studies64 of the impacts of climate change
in a world where the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration had
doubled from its pre-industrial level. The most detailed studies had been
carried out for the United States. For those impacts against which some
value of damage can be placed, estimates fell in the range of ﬁfty-ﬁve to
seventy-ﬁve thousand million dollars per annum or between 1.0% and
1.5% of the US GDP in 1990. For other countries in the developed world,
estimates of the cost of impacts in terms of percentage of GDP were
similar. For the developing world, estimates of annual cost were typically
around ﬁve per cent of GDP (with a range of from two to nine per cent
of GDP). Aggregated over the world the estimates are between 1.5% and
2% of globally aggregated GDP (sometimes called global world product
or GWP). These studies provided the ﬁrst indication of the scale of the
problem in economic terms. However, as the authors of these economic
studies explain, their estimates were crude, were based on very broad
assumptions, were mostly calculated in terms of the impact on today’s
economies rather than future ones and should not be considered as precise
values.
More recent studies have given more consideration to the possibilities for adaptation (not forgetting the cost of adaptation) through which
there is large potential to reduce the damage cost of climate change.
This is especially the case in the agricultural sector.65 In that sector,
again for doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, studies of global aggregate economic impact vary from the slightly negative
to the moderately positive depending on underlying assumptions (see
also Impact on agriculture and food supply, pages 164ff.). But the aggregate hides large regional differences. Beneﬁcial effects are expected

Costing the total impacts

predominantly in the developed world; strongly negative effects are expected for populations that are poorly connected to regional and global
trading systems. Regions that will get drier or are already quite hot for
agriculture also will suffer, as will countries that are less well prepared
to adapt (e.g. because of lack of infrastructure, capital or education).
Overall, climate change is likely to tip agriculture production in favour
of well-to-do and well-fed regions at the expense of less well-to-do and
less well-fed regions. However, these studies have largely ignored the
increasing inﬂuence of climate extremes and as yet inadequately considered important factors such as water availability – largely because of
the lack of detailed information regarding these.
A further factor to which more consideration has recently been given
is the possibility of what are often called ‘singular events’ or irreversible
events of large or unknown impact. Some of these have been mentioned
earlier in this chapter or in previous chapters. Some examples are given
in Table 7.4. It is clearly extremely difﬁcult to provide quantitative estimates of the probability of such events. Nevertheless it is important
that they are not ignored. One recent study66 has allocated a potential
damage cost to these of about one per cent of GWP for a warming of
2.5 ◦ C and about seven per cent of GWP for a warming of 6 ◦ C. Such
calculations are necessarily based on highly speculative assumptions,
but in that particular study these singular events represent the largest
single contributor to the total overall cost.
These further factors, such as more adaptation and singular events,
have worked in both directions in the estimates of cost, some reducing and some increasing them. There has tended therefore to be a
greater spread in the overall results, thus emphasising the large uncertainties hidden in the calculations.67 Further, little or no allowance
has been made in recent studies for the important inﬂuence of extreme
events.
If some allowance is made for the impact of extreme events (as
described in the last section), the studies so far suggest, in very general terms, that the cost of damage due to climate change induced by a
doubling of the pre-industrial carbon dioxide concentration that can be
expressed in monetary terms is typically around one or two per cent of
GDP for developed countries and perhaps ﬁve per cent or more of GDP
in developing countries. However, what is also clear is that any estimates
at the moment must be considered as preliminary and uncertain, because
of inadequacies in both the assumptions that have to be made and the
available data necessary for the calculations.
An initial inspection of the sort of cost ﬁgures we have been presenting in the last few paragraphs might suggest that the costs of global

WAIS may be vulnerable to climate
change because it is grounded below

global sea level by four to six metres.
Signiﬁcant sea level rise from this
cause is very unlikely during the
twenty-ﬁrst century, but a contribution
of up to three metres over the next
1000 years is considered possible.

The overall impact of global warming

warming, although large, at a few per cent of GWP are not impossibly large, and that we might be able to buy our way out of the problems
of its impact. There are, however, two factors which have been omitted
from the studies cited above. The ﬁrst is that the studies have only been
concerned with the impacts of global warming up to about the middle
of the next century when, for a business-as-usual scenario, the equivalent carbon dioxide concentration will have doubled from its preindustrial value. The longer-term impacts, if the growth of greenhouse
gases continues under business-as-usual, are likely to be much greater.68
The second factor is that impacts cannot be quantiﬁed in terms of monetary cost alone. For instance, the loss of life (see question 7), human
amenity, natural amenity or the loss of species cannot be easily expressed
in money terms. This can be illustrated by focusing on those who are
likely to be particularly disadvantaged by global warming. Most of them
will be in the developing world at around the subsistence level. They
will ﬁnd their land is no longer able to sustain them because it has been
lost either to sea level rise or to extended drought. They will therefore
wish to migrate and will become environmental refugees.
It has been estimated that, under a business-as-usual scenario, the total number of persons displaced by the impacts of global warming could
total of the order of 150 million by the year 2050 (or about three million
per year on average) – about 100 million due to sea level rise and coastal
ﬂooding and about ﬁfty million due to the dislocation of agricultural production mainly due to the incidence and location of areas of drought.69
The cost of resettling three million displaced persons per year (assuming
that is possible) has been estimated at between $US1000 and $US5000
per person, giving a total of about ten thousand million US dollars per
year.70 What the estimated cost for resettlement does not include, however (as the authors of the study themselves emphasise), is the human
cost associated with displacement. Nor does it include the social and political instabilities that ensue when substantial populations are seriously
disrupted because their means of livelihood has disappeared. The effects
of these could be very large.

The overall impact of global warming
The incidence of various impacts of global warming is complex and far
from uniform over the world. The following is a brief summary of what
we have learnt in this chapter.
r There are many ways in which our current environment is being degraded due to human activities; global warming will tend to exacerbate
these degradations. Sea level rise will make the situation worse for

low-lying land that is subsiding because of the withdrawal of groundwater and because the amount of sediment required to maintain the
level of the land has been reduced. The loss of soil due to overuse of
land or deforestation will be accelerated, with increasing droughts or
ﬂoods in some areas. In other places, extensive deforestation will lead
to drier climates and less sustainable agriculture.
To respond to the impacts from the changes brought about by global
warming, it will be necessary to adapt. In many cases this will involve
changes in infrastructure, for instance new sea defences or water supplies. Many of the impacts of climate change will be adverse, but even
when the impacts in the long term turn out to be beneﬁcial, in the short
term the process of adaptation will mostly have a negative impact and
involve cost.
Many of the important impacts of climate change are likely to arise
because of changes in the frequency and/or intensity of extreme events
(see Table 7.5 for a summary). For example, some parts of the world
are expected to become warmer and drier, especially in summer, with
a greater likelihood of droughts and heat waves; in other parts a greater
incidence of ﬂoods is expected.
Through adaptation to different crops and practices, ﬁrst indications
are that the total of world food production will not be seriously affected
by climate change – although studies have not yet taken into account
the likely occurrence of climate extremes. However, the disparity in
per capita food supplies between the developed and the developing
world will almost certainly become larger.
Because of the likely rate of climate change, there will also be a serious impact on natural ecosystems, especially at mid to high latitudes. Forests especially will be affected by increased climate stress
causing substantial die-back and loss of production, associated with
which there is the positive feedback of additional carbon dioxide
emissions. In a warmer world longer periods of heat stress will have
an effect on human health; warmer temperatures will also encourage the spread of certain tropical diseases, such as malaria, to new
areas.
Economists have attempted to estimate the average annual cost in monetary terms of the impacts that would arise under the climate change
due to a doubling of pre-industrial atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. If some allowance is added for the impact of extreme events,
the estimates are typically around one or two per cent of GDP for
developed countries and around ﬁve per cent or more for developing
countries. Later chapters will compare them with the cost of taking
action to slow the onset of global warming or reduce its overall magnitude. But it is important to realise that these attempts at monetary

The impacts of climate change

costing can only represent a part of the overall impact story. Any
assessment of impacts has to take into account the cost in human
terms and the large social and political disruption some of the impacts
will bring. In particular, it is estimated that there could be up to three
million new environmental refugees each year or over 150 million by
the middle of the twenty-ﬁrst century.
It is important to bear in mind that these estimates of overall impact have
concentrated on the doubled carbon dioxide scenario (in other words, the
next ﬁfty or sixty years). Soon after the end of the twenty-ﬁrst century,
under the scenarios with higher carbon dioxide emissions (in other words,
if strong action is not taken to curb emissions), a further doubling of the
equivalent carbon dioxide concentration will have occurred and it will be
continuing to rise. The impacts of the additional climate change which
would occur with a second effective doubling of carbon dioxide will be
substantially more severe than those of the ﬁrst doubling.
That, of course, is a lot further away in time; perhaps for that reason it
has not been given much attention. However, because of the long life-time
of some greenhouse gases, because of the long memory of the climate
system, because some of the impacts may turn out to be irreversible and
also because of the time taken for human activities and ecosystems to
respond and change course, it is important to have an eye on the longer
term. The much more severe impacts that can be expected at longer
time horizons (see Table 7.4) increase the imperative now to take the
necessary action.
However, many will ask why we should be concerned about the state
of the Earth so far ahead in the future. Can we not leave it to be looked
after by future generations? The next chapter will give something of my
personal motivation for caring about what happens to the Earth in the
future as well as now.

For your local region, ﬁnd out about its water supply and how the water is
used (e.g. by domestic users, agriculture, industry, etc.). What are likely to be
the trends in its use over the next ﬁfty years due, for instance, to population
changes or changes in agriculture or industry? What are the possibilities for
increased supply and how might these be affected by climate change?
For your local area, ﬁnd out about current environmental problems such
as sea level rise due to subsidence, over-use of ground water, air pollution
affecting forests. Which of these are likely to be exacerbated by climate
change? Try to estimate by how much.
For your local region, identify the possible impacts of climate change over
the next one hundred years and quantify them as far as you can. Attempt to
make an estimate of the cost of the damage for each impact. How far could
adaptation reduce each type of damage?

In the past, human communities have adapted to changes of many kinds
including some changes in climate. It is sometimes argued that, because the
adaptability of human beings is not fully allowed for, the likely damage from
the impacts of climate change in the future tends to be overestimated. Do
you agree?
In economic cost–beneﬁt analyses, it is often necessary to attach a value to a
‘statistical life’.71 It is not human life itself that is being valued but a change
in the risk of death averaged over a population of human beings. One way
of attempting this valuation is to consider a person as an economic agent
capable of producing economic output. However, the preferred approach is
to value a statistical life on the basis of what individuals are willing to pay
or accept for changes in the risk of death. This approach tends to produce
very different money values between developed countries and developing
countries. Do you think this is defensible? Give up to ﬁve examples of the
analysis of particular environmental problems for which you think it would
be useful to include the valuation of a statistical human life. Look for values
that have been attributed in different circumstances. Do questions of equity
have any relevance in your examples?

Chapter 8

Why should we be concerned?

I have been describing the likely changes in climate that may occur as
a result of human activities, and the impact these may have in different
parts of the world. But large and potentially devastating changes are likely
to be a generation or more away. So why should we be concerned? What
responsibility, if any, do we have for the planet as a whole and the great
variety of other forms of life that inhabit it, or for future generations of
human beings? And does our scientiﬁc knowledge in any way match up
with other insights, for instance ethical and religious ones, regarding our
relationship with our environment? In this chapter I want to digress from
the detailed consideration of global warming (to which I shall return)
in order brieﬂy to explore these fundamental questions and to present
something of my personal viewpoint on them.

Earth in the balance
Al Gore, Vice-President of the United States in the Clinton Administration, entitled his book on the environment Earth in the Balance,1 implying that there are balances in the environment that need to be maintained.
A small area of a tropical forest possesses an ecosystem that contains
some thousands of plant and animal species, each thriving in its own
ecological niche in close balance with the others. Balances are also important for larger regions and for the Earth as a whole. These balances
can be highly precarious, especially where humans are concerned.
One of the ﬁrst to point this out was Rachel Carson in her book Silent
Spring,2 ﬁrst published in 1962, which described the damaging effects
of pesticides on the environment. Humans are an important part of the
197

198

Why should we be concerned?

global ecosystem; as the size and scale of human activities continue to
escalate, so can the seriousness of the disturbances caused to the overall
balances of nature. Some examples of this were given in the last chapter.
It is important that we recognise these balances, in particular the
careful relationship between humans and the world around us. It needs
to be a balanced and harmonious relationship in which each generation
of humans should leave the Earth in a better state, or at least in as good a
state as they found it. The word that is often used for this is sustainability – politicians talk of sustainable development (see box in Chapter 9,
page 226). This principle, and its link with the harmonious relationship
between humans and nature, was given prominent place by the United
Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de
Janeiro in Brazil in June 1992. The ﬁrst principle in a list of twenty-seven
at the Rio Declaration adopted by the Conference is ‘Human beings are
at the centre of concerns for sustainable development. They are entitled
to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature.’3
However, despite such statements of principle from a body such as
the United Nations, many of the attitudes that we commonly have towards
the Earth are not balanced, harmonious or sustainable. Some of these are
brieﬂy outlined in the following paragraphs.

Exploitation
Humankind has over many centuries been exploiting the Earth and its
resources. It was at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution some two
hundred years ago that the potential of the Earth’s minerals began to
be realised. Coal, the result of the decay of primaeval forests and laid
down over many millions of years, was the main source of energy for the
new industrial developments. Iron ore to make steel was mined in vastly
increased quantities. The search for other metals such as zinc, copper
and lead was intensiﬁed until today many millions of tonnes are mined
each year. Around 1960, oil took over from coal as the dominant world
source of energy; oil and gas between them now supply over twice the
energy supplied by coal.
We have not only been exploiting the Earth’s mineral resources.
The Earth’s biological resources have also been attacked. Forests have
been cut down on a large scale to make room for agriculture and for
human habitation. Tropical forests are a particularly valuable resource,
important for maintaining the climate of tropical regions. They have
also been estimated to contain perhaps half of all the Earth’s biological
species. Yet only about half of the mature tropical forests that existed
a few hundred years ago still stand.4 At the present rate of destruction
virtually all will be gone by the end of the twenty-ﬁrst century.

‘Back to nature’

Great beneﬁts have come to humankind through the use of fossil
fuels, minerals and other resources. Yet, much of this exploitation has
been carried out with little or no thought as to whether this use of natural
resources has been a responsible one. Early in the Industrial Revolution it
seemed that resources were essentially limitless. Later on, as one source
ran out others became available to more than take its place. Even now, for
most minerals new sources are being found faster than present sources
are being used. But the growth of use is such that this situation cannot
continue. In many cases known reserves or even likely reserves will
begin to run out during the next hundred or few hundred years. These
resources have been laid down over many millions if not billions of
years. Nature took about a million years to lay down the amount of
fossil fuel that we now burn worldwide every year – and in doing so it
seems that we are causing rapid change of the Earth’s climate. Such a
level of exploitation is clearly not in balance, not harmonious and not
sustainable.

‘Back to nature’
Almost the reverse of this attitude is the suggestion that we all adopt
a much more primitive lifestyle and give up a large part of industry
and intensive farming – that we effectively put the clock back two or
three hundred years to before the Industrial Revolution. That sounds
very seductive and some individuals can clearly begin to live that way.
But there are two main problems.
The ﬁrst is that it is just not practical. The world population is now
some six times what it was two hundred years ago and about three times
that of ﬁfty years ago. The world cannot be adequately fed without
farming on a reasonably intensive scale and without modern methods
of food distribution. Further, most people that have them would not be
prepared to be without the technical aids – electricity, central heating,
refrigerator, washing machine, television and so on – which give the
freedom, the interest and the entertainment which is so much taken for
granted. Moreover, increasing numbers of people in the developing world
are also taking advantage of and enjoy these aids to a life of less drudgery
and more freedom.
The second problem is that it fails to take account of human creativity. Human scientiﬁc and technical development cannot be frozen at a
given point in history, insisting that no further ideas can be developed. A
proper balance between humans and the environment must leave room
for humans to exercise their creative skills.
Again, therefore, a ‘back to nature’ viewpoint is neither balanced
nor sustainable.

199

200

Why should we be concerned?

The technical ﬁx
A third common attitude to the Earth is to invoke the ‘technical ﬁx’. As
a senior environmental ofﬁcial from the United States said to me some
years ago, ‘We cannot change our lifestyle because of the possibility of
climate change, we just need to ﬁx the biosphere.’ It was not clear just
what he supposed the technical ﬁxes would turn out to be. The point
that he was making is that, in the past, humans have been so effective at
developing new technology to meet the problems as they arise, can it not
be assumed that this will continue? Concern about the future then turns
into ﬁnding the ‘ﬁxes’ as they are required.
On the surface the ‘technical ﬁx’ route may sound a good way to
proceed; it demands little effort and no foresight. It implies that damage
can be corrected when it has been created rather than avoided in the ﬁrst
place. But damage already done to the environment by human activities
is causing problems now. It is as if, in looking after my home, I decided
not to carry out any routine maintenance but ‘ﬁxed’ the failures as they
occurred. For my home that would be a high-risk route to follow: failure
to rewire when necessary could easily lead to a disastrous ﬁre. A similar
attitude to the Earth is both arrogant and irresponsible. It fails to recognise
the vulnerability of nature to the large changes that human activities are
now able to generate.
Science and technology possess enormous potential to assist in caring for the Earth, but they must be employed in a careful, balanced and
responsible way. The ‘technical ﬁx’ approach is neither balanced nor
sustainable.

Future generations
Having described attitudes that are not balanced or harmonious in their
relationship to the Earth and that fail to contribute to sustainability, I now
turn to describe attitudes to the environment that are more acceptable in
terms of the criteria I have set.
Firstly, there is our responsibility to future generations. It is a basic
instinct that we wish to see our children and our grandchildren well set
up in the world and wish to pass on to them some of our most treasured
possessions. A similar desire would be that they inherit from us an Earth
which has been well looked after and which does not pose to them more
difﬁcult problems than those we have had to face. But such an attitude
is not universally held. I remember well, after a presentation I made on
global warming to the British Cabinet at Number Ten, Downing Street
in London, a senior politician commented that the problem would not
become serious in his lifetime and could be left for its solution to the

The unity of the Earth

next generation. I do not think he had appreciated that the longer we
delay in taking action, the larger the problem becomes and the more
difﬁcult to solve. There is a need to face up to the problem now for the
sake of the next and subsequent generations. We have no right to act as if
there is no tomorrow. We also have a responsibility to give to those who
follow us a pattern for their future based on the principle of sustainable
development.

The unity of the Earth
A second point of view sees us as having some responsibility, not just
for all generations of humanity, but also for the larger world of all living
things. We are, after all, part of that larger world. There is good scientiﬁc justiﬁcation for this. We are becoming increasingly aware of our
dependence on the rest of nature and of the interdependencies that exist
between different forms of life, between living systems and the physical
and chemical environment that surrounds life on the Earth – and indeed
between ourselves and the rest of the universe.
The scientiﬁc theory named Gaia after the Greek Earth goddess
and publicised particularly by James Lovelock emphasises these interdependencies. Lovelock5 points out that the chemical composition of
the Earth’s atmosphere is very different from that of our nearest planetary neighbours, Mars and Venus. Their atmospheres, apart from some
water vapour, are almost pure carbon dioxide. The Earth’s atmosphere,
by contrast, is seventy-eight per cent nitrogen, twenty-one per cent oxygen and only 0.03% carbon dioxide. So far as the major constituents are
concerned, this composition has remained substantially unchanged over
many millions of years – a fact that is very surprising when it is realised
that it is a composition that is very far from chemical equilibrium.
This very different atmosphere on the Earth has come about because
of the emergence of life. Early in the history of life, plants appeared
which photosynthesise, taking in carbon dioxide and giving out oxygen.
There followed other living systems which ‘breathe’, taking in oxygen
and giving out carbon dioxide. The presence of life therefore inﬂuences
and effectively controls the environment to which living systems in turn
adapt. It is the close match of the environment to the needs of life and
its development which seems so remarkable and which Lovelock has
emphasised. He gives many examples; I will quote one concerned with
oxygen in the atmosphere. There is a critical connection between the
oxygen concentration and the frequency of forest ﬁres.6 Below an oxygen
concentration of ﬁfteen per cent, ﬁres cannot be started even in dry
twigs. At concentrations above twenty-ﬁve per cent ﬁres burn extremely
ﬁercely even in the damp wood of a tropical rain forest. Some species are

201

202

Why should we be concerned?

dependent on ﬁres for their survival; for instance, some conifers require
the heat of ﬁre to release their seeds from the seed pods. Above twentyﬁve per cent concentration of oxygen there would be no forests; below
ﬁfteen per cent, the regeneration that ﬁres provide in the world’s forests
would be absent. The oxygen concentration of twenty-one per cent is
ideal.
It is this sort of connection that has driven Lovelock to propose that
there is tight coupling between the organisms that make up the world of
living systems and their environment. He has suggested a simple model of
an imaginary world called Daisyworld (see box below), which illustrates
the type of feedback mechanisms that can lead to tight coupling and exert
control. This model is similar to the one he proposed for the biological
and chemical history of the Earth during the ﬁrst 1000 million years
after primitive life ﬁrst appeared on the Earth some 3500 million years
ago.
The real world is, of course, enormously more complex than Daisyworld, which is why the Gaia hypothesis has led to so much debate.
Lovelock’s ﬁrst statement in 1972 of the hypothesis7 was that ‘Life, or
the biosphere, regulates or maintains the climate and the atmospheric
composition at an optimum for itself.’ In his later writings he introduced
the analogy between the Earth and a living organism, introducing a new
science which he calls geophysiology8 – a more recent book is entitled
Gaia, the Practical Science of Planetary Medicine.
An advanced organism such as a human being has many built-in
mechanisms for controlling the interactions between different parts of
the organism and for self-regulation. In a similar way, Lovelock argues,
the ecosystems on the Earth are so tightly coupled to their physical and
chemical environments that the ecosystems and their environment could
be considered as one organism with an integrated ‘physiology’. In this
sense he believes that the Earth is ‘alive’.
That elaborate feedback mechanisms exist in nature for control and
for adaptation to the environment is not in dispute. But many scientists
feel that Lovelock has gone too far in suggesting that ecosystems and
their environment can be considered as a single organism. Although
Gaia has stimulated much scientiﬁc comment and research, it remains
a hypothesis.9 What the debate has done, however, is to emphasise the
interdependencies that connect all living systems to their environment –
the biosphere is a system in which is incorporated a large measure of
self-control.
There is the hint of a suggestion in the Gaia hypothesis that the Earth’s
feedbacks and self-regulation are so strong that we humans need not be
concerned about the pollution we produce – Gaia has enough control
to take care of anything we might do. Such a view fails to recognise

Daisyworld and life on the early Earth
Daisyworld is an imaginary planet spinning on its
axis and orbiting a sun rather like our own. Only
daisies live in Daisyworld; they are of two hues,
black and white. The daisies are sensitive to temperature. They grow best at 20 ◦ C, below 5 ◦ C they
will not grow and above 40 ◦ C they wilt and die.
The daisies inﬂuence their own temperature by the
way they absorb and emit radiation: black ones absorb more sunlight and therefore keep warmer than
white ones.
In the early period of Daisyworld’s history (Figure 8.1), the sun is relatively cool and the black
daisies are favoured because, by absorbing sunlight,
they can keep their temperature closest to 20 ◦ C.
Most of their white cousins die because they reﬂect
sunlight and fail to keep above the critical 5 ◦ C.
However, later in the planet’s history, the sun becomes hotter. Now the white daisies can also ﬂourish; both sorts of daisies are present in abundance.
Later still as the sun becomes even hotter the white
daisies become dominant as conditions become too
warm for the black ones. Eventually, if the sun continues to increase its temperature even the white
ones cannot keep below the critical 40 ◦ C and all
the daisies die.
Daisyworld is a simple model employed by
Lovelock11 to illustrate the sort of feedbacks and

self-regulation that occur in very much more complex forms within the living systems on the Earth.
Lovelock proposes a similar simple model as a
possible description of the early history of life on
the Earth (Figure 8.2). The dashed line shows the
temperature which would be expected on a planet
possessing no life but with an atmosphere consisting, like our present atmosphere, mostly of nitrogen
with about ten per cent carbon dioxide. The rise in
temperature occurs because the sun gradually became hotter during this period. About 3500 million years ago primitive life appeared. Lovelock, in
this model, assumes just two forms of life, bacteria
that are anaerobic photosynthesisers – using carbon
dioxide to build up their bodies but not giving out
oxygen – and bacteria that are decomposers, converting organic matter back to carbon dioxide and
methane. As life appears the temperature decreases
as the concentration of the greenhouse gas, carbon
dioxide, decreases. At the end of the period about
2300 million years ago, more complicated life appears; there is an excess of free oxygen and the
methane abundance falls to low values, leading to
another fall in temperature, methane also being a
greenhouse gas. The overall inﬂuence of these biological processes has been to maintain a stable and
favourable temperature for life on the Earth.

Why should we be concerned?

the the effect on the Earth’s system of substantial disturbances, in particular vulnerability of the environment with respect to its suitability for
humans. To quote Lovelock,10 ‘Gaia, as I see her, is no doting mother
tolerant of misdemeanours, nor is she some fragile and delicate damsel
in danger from brutal mankind. She is stern and tough, always keeping
the world warm and comfortable for those who obey the rules, but ruthless in her destruction of those who transgress. Her unconscious goal
is a planet ﬁt for life. If humans stand in the way of this, we shall be
eliminated with as little pity as would be shown by the micro-brain of
an intercontinental ballistic nuclear missile in full ﬂight to its target.’
The Gaia scientiﬁc hypothesis can help to bring us back to recognise
two things: ﬁrstly, the inherent value of all parts of nature, and secondly
our dependence, as human beings, on the Earth and on our environment.
Gaia remains a scientiﬁc theory. But some have been quick to see it as a
religious idea, supporting ancient religious beliefs. Many of the world’s
religions have drawn attention to the close relationship between humans
and the Earth.
The Native American tribes of North America lived close to the
Earth. One of their chiefs when asked to sell his land expressed his
dismay at the idea and said,12 ‘The Earth does not belong to man, man
belongs to the Earth. All things are connected like the blood that unites
us all.’ An ancient Hindu saying,13 ‘The Earth is our mother, and we
are all her children’ also emphasises a feeling of closeness to the Earth.
Those who have worked closely with indigenous peoples have given
many examples of the care with which, in a balanced way, they look
after the trees, plants and animals in their local ecosystem.14
The Islamic religion teaches the value of the whole environment,
for instance in a saying of the prophet Mohammed: ‘He who revives
a dead land will be rewarded accordingly, and that which is eaten by
birds, insects and animals out of that land will be charity provided by
God’ – so emphasising both our duty to care for the natural environment and our obligation to allow all living creatures their rightful place
within it.15
Judaism and Christianity share the stories of creation in the early
chapters of the Bible that emphasise the responsibility of humans to care
for the Earth – we shall refer to these stories again later on in the chapter.
Further on in the Old Testament detailed instructions are given regarding
care for the land and the environment.16 Christianity was described by
William Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury sixty years ago, as ‘the most
materialistic of the great religions’. Because of its central belief that God
became human in Jesus (an event Christians call the incarnation), Temple
goes on to say ‘by the very nature of its central doctrine Christianity is

Environmental values

committed to a belief . . . in the reality of matter and its place in the
divine scheme’.17 For the Christian, the twin doctrines of creation and
incarnation demonstrate God’s interest in and concern for the Earth and
the life it contains.
In looking for themes that emphasise the unity between humans and
their environment, we need not conﬁne ourselves to the Earth. There
is a very much larger sphere in which a similar perspective of unity is
becoming apparent. Some astronomers and cosmologists, overwhelmed
by the size, scale, complexity, intricacy and precision of the universe,
have begun to realise that their quest for an understanding of the evolution
of the universe right from the ‘Big Bang’ some ﬁfteen thousand million
years ago is not just a scientiﬁc project but a search for meaning.18
Why else has Stephen Hawking’s book A Brief History of Time,19 in
selling over six million copies, become one of the bestsellers of our
time?
In this new search for meaning, the perspective has arisen that the
universe was made with humans in mind – an idea expressed in some
formulations of the ‘anthropic principle’.20 Two particular pointers emphasise this. Firstly, we have already seen that the Earth itself is ﬁtted
in a remarkable way for advanced forms of life. Cosmology is telling
us that, in order for life on our planet to be possible, the universe itself at the time of the Big Bang and in its early history needed to be
‘ﬁne-tuned’ to an incredible degree.21 Secondly, there is the remarkable
fact that human minds, themselves dependent on the whole universe for
their existence, are able to appreciate and understand to some extent the
fundamental mathematical structure of the universe’s design.22 As Albert Einstein commented, ‘The most incomprehensible thing about the
universe is that it is comprehensible.’ In the theory of Gaia, the Earth
itself is central and humans are just one part of life on Earth; the insights
of cosmology suggest that humans have a particular place in the whole
scheme of things.
This section has recognised the intrinsic unity and interdependencies
that exist not only on our Earth but also within the whole universe, and
the particular place that we humans have in the universe. Being aware of
these has large implications for our attitude to our environment.

Environmental values
What do we value in the environment and how do we decide what we need
to preserve, to foster or improve? At the basis of our discussion so far
have been several assumptions regarding the value or importance of different fundamental attitudes or actions, some of which I have associated

205

206

Why should we be concerned?

with ideas that come from the underlying environmental science. Is it
legitimate, however, to make connections of this kind between science
and values? It is often argued that science itself is value free. But science is not an activity in isolation. As Michael Polanyi23 has pointed
out, the facts of science cannot sensibly be considered apart from the
participation and the commitment of those who discover those facts or
incorporate them into wider knowledge.
In the methodology and the practice of science are many assumptions of value. For instance, that there is an objective world of value out
there to discover, that there is value in the qualities of elegance and economy in scientiﬁc theory, that complete honesty and cooperation between
scientists are essential to the scientiﬁc enterprise.
Values can also be suggested from the perspective of the underlying
science as we have shown earlier in the chapter.24 For instance, we have
described the Earth in terms of balance, interdependency and unity. Since
all of these are critical to the Earth as we know it, we can argue that they
are of fundamental value and worth preserving. We have also provided
some scientiﬁc evidence that humans have a particular place in the overall
scheme of the natural world, that they possess special knowledge – which
suggests that they also possess special responsibility.
Moving away from science, we have already referred to values related to the environment that come from our basic experiences as human
beings. These are often called ‘shared values’ because they are common
to different members of a human community – which may be a local
community, a nation or ultimately the global community taking in the
whole human race. An outstanding example is the conservation of the
Earth and its resources, not just for our generation but for future generations. Other examples may involve how resources are used now for
the beneﬁt of the present generation of humans and how they are shared
between different communities or nations. Holmes Rolston shows that in
these areas of shared values, natural values (valuing the natural world)
and cultural values (interpersonal, social and community values) belong
together. He writes of ‘a domain of hybrid values . . . the resultant of
integrated inﬂuences from nature and culture.’25
When shared values are applied to real situations, however, conﬂicts
often arise. For instance, how much should we forego now in order to
make provision for future generations, or how should resources be shared
between different countries, for instance between those in the relatively
rich ‘North’ and those in the relatively poor ‘South’? How do we exercise
our responsibility as humans to share the Earth with other parts of the
creation? How much resource should be deployed to maintain particular
ecosystems or to prevent loss of species? How do we apply principles
of justice and equity in the real world? Discussion within and between

Environmental values

human communities can assist in the deﬁnition and application of such
shared values.
Many of these shared values have their origins in the cultural and
religious backgrounds of human communities. Discussions about values
need therefore to recognise fully the cultural and religious traditions,
beliefs and assumptions that underlie many of our attitudes and reasoning
about ethical concerns.
An obstacle to the recognition of religious assumptions in the attempt to establish environmental values is the view that religious belief
is not consistent with a scientiﬁc outlook. Some scientists maintain that
only science can provide real explanations based on provable evidence
whereas the assertions of religion cannot be tested in an objective way.26
Other scientists, however, have suggested that the seeming inconsistency
between science and religion arises because of misunderstandings about
the questions being addressed by the two disciplines and that there is
more in common between the methodologies of science and religion
than is commonly thought.27
Scientists are looking for descriptions of the world that ﬁt into an
overall scientiﬁc picture. They are working towards making this picture
as complete as possible. For instance, scientists are looking for mechanisms to describe the ‘ﬁne-tuning’ of the universe (these are known as
‘Theories of Everything’!) mentioned earlier. They are also looking for
mechanisms to describe the interdependencies between living systems
and the environment.
But the scientiﬁc picture can only depict part of what concerns us as
human beings. Science deals with questions of ‘how’ not questions of
‘why’. Most questions about values are ‘why’ questions. Nevertheless,
scientists do not always draw clear distinctions between the two. Their
motivations have often been associated with the ‘why’ questions. That
was certainly true of the early scientists in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, many of whom were deeply religious and whose main driving
force in pursuit of the new science was that they might ‘explore the works
of God’.28
That science and religion should be seen as complementary ways
of looking at truth is a point made strongly by Al Gore in Earth in the
Balance29 which lucidly discusses current environmental issues such as
global warming. He blames much of our lack of understanding of the
environment on the modern approach, which tends to separate scientiﬁc
study from religious and ethical issues. Science and technology are often
pursued with a clinical detachment and without thinking about the ethical
consequences. ‘The new power derived from scientiﬁc knowledge could
be used to dominate nature with moral impunity,’ he writes.30 He goes
on to describe the modern technocrat as ‘this barren spirit, precinct of

207

208

Why should we be concerned?

the disembodied intellect, which knows the way things work but not
the way they are’.31 However, he also points out32 that ‘there is now
a powerful impulse in some parts of the scientiﬁc community to heal
the breach’ between science and religion. In particular, as we pursue an
understanding of the Earth’s environment, it is essential that scientiﬁc
studies and technological inventions are not divorced from their ethical
and religious context.

Stewards of the Earth
The relationship between humans and the Earth that I have been advocating is often described as one of stewardship. We are on the Earth as
its stewards. The word implies that we are carrying out our duty as stewards on behalf of someone else – but whom? Some environmentalists
see no need to answer the question speciﬁcally, others might say we are
stewards on behalf of future generations or on behalf of a generalised
humanity. A religious person would want to be more speciﬁc and say
that we are stewards on behalf of God. The religious person would also
argue that to associate the relationship of humans to God with the relationship of humans to the environment is to place the latter relationship
in a wider, more integrated, context – providing additional insights and
a more complete basis for environmental stewardship.33
In the Judaeo-Christian tradition in the story of creation in the early
chapters of the Bible is a helpful ‘model’ of stewardship – that of humans
being ‘gardeners’ of the Earth. It is not only appropriate for those from
those particular traditions – it is a model that can be widely applied. That
story tells that humans were created to care for the rest of creation – the
idea of human stewardship of creation is a very old one – and were placed
in a garden, the Garden of Eden, ‘to work it and take care of it’.34 The
animals, birds and other living creatures were brought to Adam in the
garden for him to name them.35 We are left with a picture of the ﬁrst
humans as ‘gardeners’ of the Earth – what does our work as ‘gardeners’
imply? I want to suggest four things:
r A garden provides food and water and other materials to sustain life
and human industry. Part of the garden in the Genesis story contained
mineral resources – ‘the gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and
onyx are also there’.36 The Earth provides resources of many kinds for
humans to use as they are needed.
r A garden is to be maintained as a place of beauty. The trees in the
Garden of Eden were ‘pleasing to the eye’.37 Humans are to live in
harmony with the rest of creation and to appreciate the value of all
parts of creation. Indeed, a garden is a place where care is taken to

The will to act

preserve the multiplicity of species, in particular those that are most
vulnerable. Millions of people each year visit gardens that have been
especially designed to show off the incredible variety and beauty of
nature. Gardens are meant to be enjoyed.
r A garden is a place where humans, created as described in the Genesis
story in the image of God,38 can themselves be creative. Its resources
provide for great potential. The variety of species and landscape can be
employed to increase the garden’s beauty and its productivity. Humans
have learnt to generate new plant varieties in abundance and to use their
scientiﬁc and technological knowledge coupled with the enormous
variety of the Earth’s resources to create new possibilities for life and
its enjoyment. However, the potential of this creativity is such that
increasingly we need to be aware of where it can take us; it has potential
for evil as well as for good. Further, good gardeners intervene in natural
processes with a good deal of restraint.
r A garden is to be kept so as to be of beneﬁt to future generations. In
this context, I shall always remember Gordon Dobson, a distinguished
scientist, who in the 1920s developed new means for the measurement
of ozone in the atmosphere. His home outside Oxford in England
possessed a large garden with many fruit trees. When he was 85, a
year or so before he died, I remember ﬁnding him hard at work in his
garden replacing a number of apple trees; in doing so he clearly had
future generations in mind.
How well do we humans match up to the description of ourselves as
gardeners caring for the Earth? Not very well, it must be said; we are
more often exploiters and spoilers than cultivators. Some blame science
and technology for the problems, although the fault must lie with the
craftsman rather than with the tools! Others have tried to place part of
the blame on attitudes39 that they believe originate in the early chapters
of Genesis, which talk of human beings having rule over creation and
subduing it.40 Those words, however, should not be taken out of context – they are not a mandate for unrestrained exploitation. The Genesis
chapters also insist that human rule over creation is to be exercised under
God, the ultimate ruler of creation, and with the sort of care exempliﬁed
by the picture of humans as ‘gardeners’. Why, therefore do humans so
often fail to get their act together?

The will to act
Many of the principles I have been enunciating are included at least
implicitly in the declarations, conventions and resolutions which came
out of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development

209

210

Why should we be concerned?

held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992; indeed, they form the background
of many statements emanating from the United Nations or from ofﬁcial
national sources. We are not short of statements of ideals. What tend to
be lacking are the capability and resolve to carry them out. Sir Crispin
Tickell, a British diplomat who has lectured widely on the policy implications of climate change, has commented ‘Mostly we know what to do
but we lack the will to do it’.41
Many recognise this lack of will to act as a ‘spiritual’ problem (using
the word spiritual in a general sense), meaning that we are too obsessed
with the ‘material’ and the immediate and fail to act according to generally accepted values and ideals particularly if it means some cost to
ourselves or if it is concerned with the future rather than with the present.
We are only too aware of the strong temptations we experience at both
the personal and the national levels to use the world’s resources to gratify our selﬁshness and greed. Because of this, it has been proposed that
at the basis of stewardship should be a principle extending what has
traditionally been considered wrong – or in religious parlance as sin –
to include unwarranted pollution of the environment or lack of care
for it.42
Those with religious belief tend to emphasise the importance of
coupling together the relationship of humans to the environment to the
relationship of humans to God.43 It is here, religious believers would
argue, that a solution for the problem of ‘lack of will’ can be found.
That religious belief can provide an important driving force for action
is often also recognised by those who look elsewhere than religion for a
solution.
One of the main messages of this chapter is that action addressing
environmental problems depends not only on knowledge about them
but on the values we place on the environment and our attitudes towards it. In the chapter I have suggested that assessments of environmental value and appropriate attitudes can be developed from the
following:
r The perspectives of balance, interdependence and unity in the natural
world generated by the underlying science.
r A recognition – some would argue suggested by the science – that
humans have a special place in the universe, which in turn implies that
humans have special responsibilities with respect to the natural world.
r A recognition that to damage the environment or to fail to care for it
is to do wrong.
r An interpretation of human responsibility in terms of stewardship of
the Earth based on ‘shared’ values generally recognised by different

Questions

human communities and that strives for equity and justice as between
different human communities and different generations.
r A recognition of the importance of the cultural and religious basis for
the principles of stewardship – humans as ‘gardeners’ of the Earth is
a possible ‘model’ of such stewardship.
r A recognition that, just as the totality of damage to the environment
is the sum of the damage done by a large number of individuals, the
totality of action to address environmental problems is the sum of a
large number of individual actions to which we can all contribute.44
I shall return to the practical outworking of some of these issues in
later chapters especially Chapter 12. Finally, let me recall some words of
Thomas Huxley, an eminent biologist from last century, who emphasised
the importance in the scientiﬁc enterprise of ‘humility before the facts’.
An attitude of humility is also one that lies at the heart of responsible
stewardship of the Earth.
In the next chapter we shall reﬂect on the uncertainties associated
with the science of global warming and consider how they can be taken
into account in addressing the imperative for action. For instance, should
action be taken now or should we wait until the uncertainties are less
before deciding on the right action to take?
Questions
1 There is a debate regarding the relationship of humans to the environment.
Should humans be at the centre of the environment with everything else and
other life related to the human centre – in other words an anthropocentric
view? Or should higher prominence be given to the non-human part of nature
in our scheme of things and in our consideration of values – a more ecocentric
view? If so, what form should this higher prominence take?
2 How far can science be involved in the generation and application of environmental values?
3 How far do you think environmental values can be generated through debate
and discussion in a human community without reference to the cultural or
religious background of that community?
4 It has been suggested that religious belief (especially strongly held belief) is a hindrance in the debate about environmental values. Do you
agree?
5 Should we strive for universally accepted values with respect to the environment? Or is it acceptable for different communities to possess different
values?
6 Identify and list as many values as you can that belong to the categories
natural and cultural (see page 206). In what ways do items in these categories
‘belong together’?

211

212

Why should we be concerned?

7 An argument for religious belief which is sometimes put forward, irrespective
of whether the belief is considered to have any foundation, is that such belief
motivates people more strongly than other driving forces. Do you agree with
this argument?
8 Explain how the cultural or religious traditions in which you have been
brought up have inﬂuenced your view of environmental concern or action.
How have these inﬂuences been modiﬁed because you now hold (or do not
hold) deﬁnite religious beliefs?
9 Discuss the term ‘stewardship’, which is often used as a description of the
relation of humans to the environment. Does it imply too anthropocentric a
relationship?
10 Discuss the model of humans as ‘gardeners’ of the Earth. How adequate is the picture it presents of the relationship of humans to the
environment?
11 Do you agree with Thomas Huxley when he spoke of the importance of
humility before the scientiﬁc facts? How important do you think humility
is in this context and in the wider context of the application of scientiﬁc
knowledge to environmental concern?
12 Because of the formidability of the task of stewardship of the Earth, some
have suggested that it is beyond the capability of the human race to tackle it
adequately. Do you agree?
13 In Chapter 9 (see box on page 237) the concept of Integrated Assessment
and Evaluation is introduced that involves all the natural and social science disciplines. In what ways could ethical or religious values be introduced into such evaluations? Is it appropriate and necessary that they be
included?

This was the ﬁrst of the principles that came out of a symposium (called
the Patmos Principles since the climax of the symposium, held in celebration of the 1900th anniversary of the writing of the Book of Revelation,
was on the island of Patmos) I attended in 1995 sponsored by the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of the Greek Orthodox Church and Prince
Philip in his capacity as President of the World Wildlife Fund. An extremely
eclectic group, scientists, politicians, environmentalists and theologians attended from a wide range of religious backgrounds and beliefs. John, the
Metropolitan of Pergamon, who was chairman of the symposium’s scientiﬁc committee, kept emphasising that we should consider pollution of the
environment, or lack of care for the environment, as a sin – not only against
nature but a sin against God. His message struck a strong chord with the
symposium. The principle goes on to explain that this new category of sin
should include activities that lead to ‘species extinction, reduction in genetic diversity, pollution of the water, land and air, habitat destruction and
disruption of sustainable life styles’. The symposium’s report is edited by
Sarah Hobson and Jane Lubchenco and published under the title Revelation
and the Environment:– AD95–1995. Singapore: World Scientiﬁc Publishing,
1997.
In Judaeo-Christian teaching the coupling of these two relationships begins with the Creation stories in Genesis. These stories go on to describe
how humans disobeyed God (Chapter 3) and broke the partnership. But the
Bible continually explains how God offers a way back to partnership. A
few chapters on in Genesis (9:8–17), the basis of the relationship between
God and Noah is a covenant agreement in which ‘all life on the Earth’ is
included as well as humans. A relationship based on covenant is also the
basis of the partnership between God and the Jewish nation in the Old Testament. But, after many times when that relationship was broken, the Old
Testament prophets looked forward to a new covenant based not on law but
on a real change of heart (Jeremiah 31:31–34). The New Testament writers (for example Hebrews 8:10–11) see this new covenant being worked
out through the life and particularly through the death and resurrection of
Jesus, the Son of God. Jesus promised his followers the Holy Spirit (John
15, 16), whose inﬂuence would enable the partnership between them and
God to work. Paul, in his letters, is constantly referring to the dependent relationship which forms the basis of his own partnership with God

Weighing the uncertainty

This book is intended to present clearly the current scientiﬁc position
on global warming. A key part of this presentation concerns the uncertainty associated with all parts of the scientiﬁc description, especially with
the prediction of future climate change, which forms an essential consideration when decisions regarding action are being taken. However,
uncertainty is a relative term; utter certainty is not often demanded on
everyday matters as a prerequisite for action. Here the issues are complex; we need to consider how uncertainty is weighed against the cost
of possible action. First of all we address the scientiﬁc uncertainty.

The scientiﬁc uncertainty
Before considering the ‘weighing’ process and the cost of action, we
begin by explaining the nature of the scientiﬁc uncertainty and how it
has been addressed by the scientiﬁc community.
In earlier chapters I explained in some detail the science underlying the problem of global warming and the scientiﬁc methods that are
employed for the prediction of climate change due to the increases in
greenhouse gases. The basic physics of the greenhouse effect is well
understood. If atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration doubles and
nothing else changes apart from atmospheric temperature, then the average global temperature near the surface will increase by about 1.2 ◦ C.
That ﬁgure is not disputed among scientists.
However, the situation is complicated by feedbacks and regional
variations. Numerical models run on computers are the best tools available for addressing these problems. Although they are highly complex,
216

The scientiﬁc uncertainty

climate models are capable of giving useful information of a predictive
kind. As was explained in Chapter 5, conﬁdence in the models comes
from the considerable skill with which they simulate present climate
and its variations (including perturbations such as the Pinatubo volcanic
eruption) and also from their success in simulating past climates; these
latter are limited as much by the lack of data as by inadequacies in the
models.
However, model limitations remain, which give rise to uncertainty
(see box below). The predictions presented in Chapter 6 reﬂected these
uncertainties, the largest of which are due to the models’ failure to deal
adequately with clouds and with the effects of the ocean circulation.
These uncertainties loom largest when changes on the regional scale, for
instance in regional patterns of rainfall, are being considered.
With uncertainty in the basic science of climate change and in the
predictions of future climate, especially on the regional scale, there are
bound also to be uncertainties in our assessment of the impacts of climate change. As Chapter 7 shows, however, some important general
statements can be made with reasonable conﬁdence. Under nearly all
scenarios of increasing carbon dioxide emissions next century, the rate
of climate change is likely to be large, probably greater than the Earth
has seen for many millennia. Many ecosystems (including human beings) will not be able to adapt easily to such a rate of change. The most

The reasons for scientiﬁc uncertainty
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change1 has described the scientiﬁc uncertainty as follows.
There are many uncertainties in our predictions particularly with
regard to the timing, magnitude and regional patterns of climate
change, due to our incomplete understanding of:

r sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, which affect predictions of future concentrations,

r clouds, which strongly inﬂuence the magnitude of climate
change,

r oceans, which inﬂuence the timing and patterns of climate
change,

r polar ice-sheets, which affect predictions of sea level rise.
These processes are already partially understood, and we are conﬁdent that the uncertainties can be reduced by further research. However, the complexity of the system means that we cannot rule out
surprises.

217

218

Weighing the uncertainty

noticeable impacts are likely to be on the availability of water (especially
on the frequency and severity of droughts and ﬂoods), on the distribution
(though possibly not on the overall size) of global food production and
on sea level in low-lying areas of the world. Further, although most of
our predictions have been limited in range to the end of the twenty-ﬁrst
century, it is clear that by the century beyond 2100 the magnitude of the
change in climate and the impacts resulting from that change are likely
to be very large indeed.
The statement in the box regarding scientiﬁc uncertainty was formulated for the IPCC 1990 Report. Over ten years later it remains a
good statement of the main factors that underly scientiﬁc uncertainty.
That this is the case does not imply little progress in the past decade.
On the contrary, as the subsequent IPCC Reports show, a great deal of
progress has been made in scientiﬁc understanding and in the development of models. There is now much more conﬁdence that the signal
of anthropogenic climate change is apparent in the observed climate
record. Models now include much more sophistication in their scientiﬁc
formulations and possess increased skill in simulating the important
climate parameters. For regional scale simulation and prediction, regional climate models (RCMs) with higher resolution have been
developed that are nested within global models (see Chapters 5 and 6).
These RCMs are beginning to bring more conﬁdence to regional projections of climate change. Further, over the last decade, a lot of progress has
been made with studies in various regions of the sensitivity to different
climates of these regions’ resources, such as water and food. Coupling
such studies with regional scenarios of climate change produced by climate models enables more meaningful impact assessments to be carried
out2 and also enables appropriate measures to be assessed. Particularly in
some regions large uncertainties remain; it will be seen for instance from
Figure 6.5 that current models perform better for some regions than for
others.
Summarised in Figure 9.1 are the various components that are included in the development of projections of climate change or its impacts.
All of these possess uncertainties that need to be aggregated appropriately in arriving at estimates of uncertainties in different impacts.

The IPCC assessments
Because of the scientiﬁc uncertainty, it has been necessary to make a
large effort to achieve the best assessment of present knowledge and to
express it as clearly as possible. For these reasons the IPCC was set up
jointly by two United Nations’ bodies, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environmental Programme

(UNEP). The IPCC’s ﬁrst meeting in November 1988 was timely; it was
held just as strong political interest in global climate change was beginning to develop. The Panel realised the urgency of the problem and,
under the overall chairmanship of Professor Bert Bolin from Sweden,
established three working groups, one to deal with the science of climate
change, one with impacts and a third one to deal with policy responses.
The IPCC has produced three main comprehensive Reports,3 in 1990,
1995 and 2001, together with a number of special reports covering particular issues. Previous chapters have already referred widely to these
reports.
I would like to say more about the Science Assessment Working
Group (of which I was chairman from 1988 until 1992 and co-chairman
from 1992 until 2002).4 Its task has been to present in the clearest possible terms our knowledge of the science of climate change together with
our best estimate of the climate change over the twenty-ﬁrst century that
is likely to occur as a result of human activities. In preparing its reports
the Working Group realised from the start that if they were to be really
authoritative and taken seriously, it would be necessary to involve as
many as possible of the world scientiﬁc community in their production.

Weighing the uncertainty

A small international organising team was set up at the Hadley Centre
of the United Kingdom Meteorological Ofﬁce at Bracknell and through
meetings, workshops and a great deal of correspondence most of those
scientists in the world (both in universities and government-supported
laboratories) who are deeply engaged in research into the science of climate change were involved in the preparation and writing of the reports.
For the ﬁrst report, 170 scientists from 25 countries contributed and a
further 200 scientists were involved in its peer review. For the third assessment report in 2001, these numbers had grown to 123 lead authors
and 516 contributing authors involved with the various chapters, together
with 21 review editors and 420 expert reviewers involved in the review
process.
In addition to the comprehensive, thorough and intensively reviewed
background chapters that form the basic material for each assessment,
each report includes a Summary for Policymakers (SPM), the wording of
which is approved in detail at a plenary meeting of the Working Group,
the object being to reach agreement on the science and on the best way of
presenting the science to policymakers with accuracy and clarity. The plenary meeting which agreed unanimously the 2001 SPM, held in Shanghai
in January 2001,was attended by representatives of 99 countries and 45
scientists representing the lead authors of the scientiﬁc chapters together
with a number of representatives from non-governmental organisations.
There has been very lively discussion at these plenary meetings, most
of which has been concerned with achieving the most informative and
accurate wording rather than fundamental dispute over scientiﬁc content.
During the preparation of the reports, a considerable part of the
debate amongst the scientists has centred on just how much can be said
about the likely climate change in the twenty-ﬁrst century. Particularly
to begin with, some felt that the uncertainties were such that scientists
should refrain from making any estimates or predictions for the future.
However, it soon became clear that the responsibility of scientists to
convey the best possible information could not be discharged without
making estimates of the most likely magnitude of the change coupled
with clear statements of our assumptions and the level of uncertainty in
the estimates. Weather forecasters have a similar, although much more
short-term responsibility. Even though they may feel uncertain about
tomorrow’s weather, they cannot refuse to make a forecast. If they do
refuse, they withhold from the public most of the useful information they
possess. Despite the uncertainty in a weather forecast, it provides useful
guidance to a wide range of people. In a similar way the climate models,
although subject to uncertainty, provide useful guidance for policy.
I have given these details of the work of the Science Assessment
Group in order to demonstrate the degree of commitment of the scientiﬁc

The IPCC assessments

community to the understanding of global climate change and to the
communication of the best scientiﬁc information to the world’s politicians and policymakers. After all, the problem of global environmental
change is one of the largest problems facing the world scientiﬁc community. No previous scientiﬁc assessments on this or any other subject
have involved so many scientists so widely distributed both as regards
their countries and their scientiﬁc disciplines. The IPCC Reports can
therefore be considered as authoritative statements of the contemporary
views of the international scientiﬁc community.
A further important strength of the IPCC is that, because it is an intergovernmental body, governments are involved in its work. In particular,
government representatives assist in making sure that the presentation
of the science is both clear and relevant from the point of view of the
policymaker. Having been part of the process, the resulting assessments
are in a real sense owned by governments as well as by scientists – an
important factor when it comes to policy negotiations.
In the presentation of the IPCC assessments to politicians and policymakers, the degree of scientiﬁc consensus achieved has been of great
importance in persuading them to take seriously the problem of global
warming and its impact. In the run-up to the United Nations Conference
on Environment and Development (UNCED) at Rio de Janeiro in June
1992, the fact that they accepted the reality of the problem led to the
formulation of the Climate Convention. It has often been commented
that without the clear message that came from the world’s scientists,
orchestrated by the IPCC, the world’s leaders would never have agreed
to sign the Climate Convention.
Since the publication of the reports, the debate concerning the scientiﬁc ﬁndings has continued in the world’s press. Many have commented
favourably on their clarity and accuracy. A few scientists have criticised
because they feel the reports have insufﬁciently emphasised the uncertainties; others have expressed their disappointment that they have not
spelt out the potential dangers to the world more forcefully. The scientiﬁc
debate continues as indeed it must; argument and debate are intrinsic to
the scientiﬁc process.
I have illustrated the work of the IPCC by describing in some detail
the activity of the Science Assessment Working Group. The IPCC has
two other Working Groups that have followed similar procedures and
have dealt with the Impacts of Climate Change, with Adaptation and
Mitigation strategies and with the Economics and Social Dimensions of
Climate Change. Contributions to their work have not only come from
natural scientists; increasingly social scientists, especially economists,
have become involved. In these social science areas much fresh ground
has been broken as consideration has been given to questions of what,

221

222

Weighing the uncertainty

in the global context, might form the basis of appropriate political and
economic response to climate change. The rest of this chapter and the
following chapters will draw heavily on their work.

Narrowing the uncertainty
A key question constantly asked by policymakers is, ‘How long will it be
before scientists are more certain about the projections of likely climate
change, in particular concerning the regional and local detail?’ They were
asking that question over a decade ago and then I generally replied that in
ten to ﬁfteen years we would know a lot more. As we saw in the ﬁrst section of this chapter, over the past decade a lot of progress in knowledge has
been made. There is more conﬁdence that anthropogenic climate change
has been detected and more conﬁdence too in climate change projections
than was the case a decade ago. However, some of the key uncertainties
remain and their reduction is urgently needed. Not surprisingly,
policymakers are still asking for more certainty. What can be done to
provide it?
For the science of change, the main tools of progress are observations
and models. Both need further development and expansion. Observations
are required to detect climate change in all its aspects as it occurs and
also to validate models. That means that regular, accurate and consistent
monitoring of the most important climate parameters is required with
good coverage in both space and time. Monitoring may not sound very
exciting work, often even less exciting is the rigorous quality control
that goes with it, but it is absolutely essential if climate changes are
to be observed and understood. Because of this, a major international
programme, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) has been set
up to orchestrate and oversee the provision of observations on a global
basis. Models are needed to integrate all the scientiﬁc processes that are
involved in climate change (most of which are non-linear, which means
they cannot be added together in any simple manner) so that they can
assist in the analysis of observations and provide a method of projecting
climate change into the future.
Take, for instance, the example of cloud radiation feedback that remains the source of greatest single uncertainty associated with climate
sensitivity.5 It was mentioned in Chapter 5 that progress with understanding this feedback will be made by formulating better descriptions of cloud
processes for incorporation into models and also by comparing model
output, especially of radiation quantities, with observations especially
those made by satellites. To be really useful such measurements need
to be made with extremely high accuracy – to within the order of 0.1%

Narrowing the uncertainty

in the average radiation quantities – that is proving highly demanding.
Associated with the better measurements of clouds is the need for all
aspects of the hydrological (water) cycle to be better observed.
There is also inadequate monitoring at present of the major oceans of
the world, which cover a large fraction of the Earth’s surface. However,
this is beginning to be remedied with the introduction of new methods
of observing the ocean surface from space vehicles (see box below)
and new means of observing the interior of the ocean. But not only are
better physical measurements required: to be able to predict the detailed
increases of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the problems of the
carbon cycle must be unravelled; for this, much more comprehensive
measurements of the biosphere in the ocean as well as that on land are
needed.
Stimulated by internationally organised observing programmes such
as the GCOS, space agencies around the world have been very active
in the development of new instruments and the deployment of advanced
space platforms that are beginning to provide many new observations
relevant to the problems of climate change (see box below).

Space observations of the climate system
For forecasting the weather round the world – for airlines, for shipping,
for many other applications and for the public – meteorologists rely
extensively on observations from satellites. Under international agreements, ﬁve geostationary satellites are spaced around the equator for
weather observation; moving pictures from them have become familiar
to us on our television screens. Information from polar orbiting satellites is also available to the weather services of the world to provide input
into computer models of the weather and to assist in forecasting (see for
instance Figure 5.4).
These weather observations provide a basic input to climate models.
But for climate prediction and research, comprehensive observations
from other components of the climate system, the oceans, ice and land
surface are required. ENVISAT, a satellite launched by the European
Space Agency in 2002, is an example of the most recent generation of
large satellites in which the latest techniques are directed to observing the
Earth. The instruments are directed at the measurement of atmospheric
temperature and composition (MIPAS, SCIAMACHY and GOMOS),
sea surface temperature and topography, the latter for ocean current
information (AATSR and RA-2), information about ocean biology and
land surface vegetation (MERIS) and sea-ice coverage and ice-sheet
topography (ASAR and RA-2).

Alongside the increased understanding and more accurate predictions of climate change coming from the community of natural scientists, much more effort is now going into studies of human behaviour
and activities, how they will inﬂuence climate through changes in emissions of greenhouse gases and how they in turn might be affected by
different degrees of climate change. Much better quantiﬁcation of the
impacts of climate change will result from these studies. Economists
and other social scientists are pursuing detailed work on possible response strategies and the economic and political measures that will be
necessary to achieve them. It is also becoming increasingly realised that

Sustainable development

there is an urgent need to interconnect more strongly research in the
natural sciences with that in the social sciences. The integrated framework presented in Chapter 1 (Figure 1.5) illustrates the scope of interactions and of required integration between all the intellectual disciplines
involved.

Sustainable development
So much for uncertainty in the science of global warming. But how does
this uncertainty map on to the world of political decision making? A key
idea is that of sustainable development.
One of the remarkable movements of the last few years is the way in
which problems of the global environment have moved up the political
agenda. In her speech at the opening in 1990 of the Hadley Centre
at the United Kingdom Meteorological Ofﬁce, Margaret Thatcher, the
former British Prime Minister, explained our clear responsibility to the
environment. ‘We have a full repairing lease on the Earth. With the work
of the IPCC, we can now say we have the surveyor’s report; and it shows
there are faults and that the repair work needs to start without delay. The
problems do not lie in the future, they are here and now: and it is our
children and grandchildren, who are already growing up, who will be
affected.’ Many other politicians have similarly expressed their feelings
of responsibility for the global environment. Without this deeply felt and
widely held concern, the UNCED conference at Rio, with environment
as the number one item on its agenda, could never have taken place.
But, despite its importance, even when concentrating on the long
term, the environment is only one of many considerations politicians
must take into account. For developed countries, the maintenance
of living standards, full employment (or something close to it) and
economic growth have become dominant issues. Many developing
countries are facing acute problems in the short term: basic survival
and large debt repayment; others, under the pressure of large increases
in population, are looking for rapid industrial development. However,
an important characteristic of environmental problems, compared with
many of the other issues faced by politicians, is that they are long-term
and potentially irreversible – which is why Tim Wirth, the Under
Secretary of State for Global Affairs in the United States Government
during the Clinton Administration, said, ‘The economy is a wholly
owned subsidiary of the environment’.
A balance, therefore, has to be struck between the provision of necessary resources for development and the long-term need to preserve the
environment. That is why the Rio Conference was about Environment
and Development. The formula that links the two is called sustainable

225

226

Weighing the uncertainty

development (see box below) – development which does not carry with
it the overuse of irreplaceable resources or irreversible environmental
degradation.
The idea of sustainable development echoes what was said in Chapter 8, when addressing more generally the relationship of humans to their
environment and especially the need for balance and harmony. The Climate Convention signed at the Rio Conference also recognised the need
for this balance. In the statement of its objective (see box on page 243
in Chapter 10), it states the need for stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. It goes on to explain that this should be
at a level and on a timescale such that ecosystems are allowed to adapt
to climate change naturally, that food production is not threatened and
that economic development can proceed in a sustainable manner.

Sustainable development: how is it deﬁned?
A number of deﬁnitions of sustainable development have been produced.
The following two well capture the idea.
According to the Bruntland Commission Report Our Common Future presented in 1987, sustainable development is ‘meeting the needs
of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs’.
A more detailed deﬁnition is contained in the White Paper This
Common Inheritance, published by the United Kingdom Department of
the Environment in 1990: ‘sustainable development means living on the
Earth’s income rather than eroding its capital’ and ‘keeping the consumption of renewable natural resources within the limits of their replenishment’. It recognises the intrinsic value of the natural world explaining
that sustainable development ‘means handing down to successive generations not only man-made wealth (such as buildings, roads and railways)
but also natural wealth, such as clean and adequate water supplies, good
arable land, a wealth of wildlife and ample forests’.
The United Kingdom Government’s ﬁrst strategy report on sustainable development, issued in January 1994,6 deﬁned four principles that
should govern necessary collective action:

r Decisions should be based on the best possible scientiﬁc information and analysis of risks.

r Where there is uncertainty and potentially serious risks exist, precautionary action may be necessary.

r Ecological impacts must be considered, particularly where resources are non-renewable or effects may be irreversible.

r Cost implications should be brought home directly to the people
responsible – the ‘polluter pays’ principle.

Why not wait and see?

It is also increasingly realised that the idea of sustainability not only
applies to the environment but also to human communities. Sustainable
development is often therefore assumed to include wider social factors
as well as environmental and economic ones. The provision of social
justice and equity are important components of a drive to sustainable
communities. Considerations of equity include not just equity between
nations but also equity between generations: we should not leave the
world in a poorer state for the next generation.

Why not wait and see?
In taking action to satisfy the requirements of sustainable development
a balance must be struck between many factors. The following sections
address some of the arguments, issues and principles that are involved
in this debate.
Firstly, in the light of scientiﬁc uncertainty, it is often argued that the
case is not strong enough for any action to be taken now. What we should
do is to obtain as quickly as possible, through appropriate research programmes, much more precise information about future climate change
and its impact. We would then, so the argument goes, be in a much better
position to decide on relevant action.
It is true that more accurate information is urgently needed so that
decisions can be better informed. But in any sensible future planning,
all information about likely future needs has to be taken properly into
account. Decisions now should be informed by the best information
available now, even if it is imperfect.
In the ﬁrst place, quite a lot is already known – enough to scope the
problem as a whole. There is general consensus amongst scientists about
the most likely overall magnitude of climate change and there are good
indications about its probable impact. Although we are not yet very conﬁdent regarding detailed predictions, enough is known to realise that the
rate of climate change due to increasing greenhouse gases will almost
certainly bring substantial deleterious effects and pose a large problem to
the world. It will hit some countries much more than others. Those worst
hit are likely to be those in the developing world that are least able to
cope with it. Some countries may actually experience a more beneﬁcial
climate. But in a world where there is increasing interdependence
between nations, no nation will be immune from the effects.
Secondly, the timescales of both atmospheric and human responses
are long. Carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere today will contribute to the increased concentration of this gas and the associated climate change for over a hundred years. The more that is emitted now, the
more difﬁcult it will be to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration to the levels that will eventually be required. With regard to the

227

228

Weighing the uncertainty

human response, the major changes that are likely to be needed, for instance in large-scale infrastructure, will take many decades. Large power
stations that will produce electricity in thirty or forty years’ time are being planned and built today. The demands that are likely to be placed on
all of us because of concerns about global warming need to be brought
into the planning process now.
Thirdly, many of the required actions not only lead to substantial
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions but they are good to do for other
reasons which bring other direct beneﬁts – such proposals for action are
often described as ‘no regrets’ proposals. Many actions addressing increased efﬁciency lead also to net savings in cost (sometimes called ‘winwin’ measures). Other actions lead to improvements in performance or
additional comfort.
Fourthly, there are more general beneﬁcial reasons for some of the
proposed actions. In Chapter 8 it was pointed out that humans are far too
proﬂigate in their use of the world’s resources. Fossil fuels are burnt and
minerals are used, forests are cut down and soil is eroded without any
serious thought of the needs of future generations. The imperative of the
global warming problem will help us to use the world’s resources in a
more sustainable way. Further, the technical innovation that will be required in the energy industry – in energy efﬁciency and conservation and
in renewable energy development – will provide a challenge and opportunity to the world’s industry to develop important new technologies –
more of that in Chapter 11.

The Precautionary Principle
Some of these arguments for action are applications of what is often
called the Precautionary Principle, one of the basic principles that was
included in the Rio Declaration at the Earth Summit in June 1992 (see box
below). A similar statement is contained in article 3 of the Framework
Convention on Climate Change (see box on page 243 in Chapter 10).
We often apply the Precautionary Principle in our day-to-day living.
We take out insurance policies to cover the possibility of accidents or
losses; we carry out precautionary maintenance on housing or on vehicles, and we readily accept that in medicine prevention is better than
cure. In all these actions we weigh up the cost of insurance or other
precautions against the possible damage and conclude that the investment is worthwhile. The arguments are very similar as the Precautionary
Principle is applied to the problem of global warming.
In taking out an insurance policy we often have in mind the possibility of the unexpected. In fact, when selling their policies, insurance companies often trade on our fear of the unlikely or the unknown,

The Precautionary Principle

especially of the more devastating possibilities. Although covering ourselves for the most unlikely happenings is not our main reason for taking
out the insurance, our peace of mind is considerably increased if the
policy includes these improbable events. In a similar way, in arguing for
action concerning global warming, some have strongly emphasised the
need to guard against the possibility of surprises (see examples in Table
7.4). They point out that, because of positive feedbacks that are not yet
well understood,7 the increase of some greenhouse gases could be much
larger than is currently predicted. They also point to the evidence that
rapid changes of climate have occurred in the past (Figures 4.6 and 4.7)
possibly because of dramatic changes in ocean circulation; they could
presumably occur again.
The risk posed by such possibilities is impossible to assess. It is,
however, salutary to call attention to the discovery of the ozone ‘hole’
over Antarctica in 1985. Scientiﬁc experts in the chemistry of the ozone
layer were completely taken by surprise by that discovery. In the years
since its discovery, the ‘hole’ has substantially increased in depth. Resulting from this knowledge, international action to ban ozone-depleting
chemicals has progressed much more rapidly. Ozone levels are beginning to recover – full recovery will take about a century. The lesson for
us here is that the climate system may be more vulnerable to disturbance
than we have often thought it to be. When it comes to future climate
change, it would not be prudent to rule out the possibility of surprises.
However, in weighing the action that needs to be taken with regard
to future climate change, although the possibility of surprises should be
kept in mind, that possibility must not be allowed to feature as the main
argument for action. Much stronger in the argument for precautionary
action is the realisation that signiﬁcant anthropogenic climate change is
not an unlikely possibility but a near certainty; it is no change of climate
that is unlikely. The uncertainties that mainly have to be weighed lie in
the magnitude of the change and the details of its regional distribution.
An argument that is sometimes advanced for doing nothing now is
that by the time action is really necessary, more technical options will be
available. By acting now, we might foreclose their use. Any action taken
now must, of course, take into account the possibility of helpful technical
developments. But the argument also works the other way. The thinking
and the activity generated by considering appropriate actions now and
by planning for more action later will itself be likely to stimulate the sort
of technical innovation that will be required.
While speaking of technical options, I should brieﬂy mention possible options to counteract global warming by the artiﬁcial modiﬁcation
of the environment (sometimes referred to as geoengineering).8 A number of proposals for ‘technical ﬁxes’ of this kind have been put forward;

229

230

Weighing the uncertainty

for instance, the installation of mirrors in space to cool the Earth by
reﬂecting sunlight away from it; the addition of dust to the upper atmosphere to provide a similar cooling effect and the alteration of cloud
amount and type by adding cloud condensation nuclei to the atmosphere.
None of these has been demonstrated to be either feasible or effective.
Further, they suffer from the very serious problem that none of them
would exactly counterbalance the effect of increasing greenhouse gases.
As has been shown, the climate system is far from simple. The results
of any attempt at large-scale climate modiﬁcation could not be perfectly
predicted and might not be what is desired. With the present state of
knowledge, artiﬁcial climate modiﬁcation along any of these lines is not
an option that needs to be considered.
The conclusion from this section – and the last one – is that to ‘wait
and see’ would be an inadequate and irresponsible response to what we
know. The Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) signed
in Rio (see box on page 243 in Chapter 10) recognised that some action
needs to be taken now. Just what that action should be and how it ﬁts in
to a sensible scheme of sequential decision making will be the subject

Principles for international action
From the three previous sections, four distinct principles can be identiﬁed to form the basis of international action. They are all contained
in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (see box below) agreed by over 160 countries at the United Nations Conference
on Environment and Development (the ‘Earth Summit’) held in Rio
de Janeiro in 1992. They can also be identiﬁed in one form or another in the FCCC (see box on page 243 in Chapter 10). The Principles (with references to the Principles of the Rio Declaration and the
Articles of the FCCC) are:

The Rio Declaration 1992
The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development was agreed by
over 160 countries at the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development (the ‘Earth Summit’) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Some
examples of the twenty-seven principles enumerated in the Declaration
are as follows:
Principle 1 Human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development. They are entitled to a healthy and productive life in
harmony with nature.
Principle 3 The right to development must be fulﬁlled so as to equitably
meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations.
Principle 5 All States and all people shall cooperate in the essential task
of eradicating poverty as an indispensable requirement for sustainable
development, in order to decrease the disparities in standards of living
and better meet the needs of the majority of the people of the world.
Principle 7 States shall cooperate in a spirit of global partnership to
conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of the Earth’s
ecosystem. In view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation, States have common but differentiated responsibilities.
The developed countries acknowledge the responsibility they bear in the
international pursuit of sustainable development in view of the pressures
their societies place on the global environment and of the technologies
and ﬁnancial resources they command.
Principle 15 In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities.
Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full
scientiﬁc certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing costeffective measures to prevent environmental degradation.
Principle 16 National authorities should endeavour to promote the internalisation of environmental costs and the use of economic instruments,
taking into account the approach that the polluter should, in principle,
bear the cost of pollution, with due regard to the public interest and
without distorting international trade and investment.

out the weighing in terms of cost? In a world that tends to be dominated
by economic arguments, quantiﬁcation of the costs of action against the
likely costs of the consequences of inaction must at least be attempted.
It is also helpful to put these costs in context by comparing them with
other items of global expenditure.

231

232

Weighing the uncertainty

The costs of anthropogenic climate change fall into three parts.
Firstly, there is the cost of the damage due to that change; for instance,
the cost of ﬂooding due to sea level rise or the cost of the increase in
the number or intensity of disasters such as ﬂoods, droughts or windstorms, and so on. Secondly, there is the cost of adaptation that reduces
the damage or the impact of the climate change. Thirdly, there is the
cost of mitigating action to reduce the amount of climate change. The
roles of adaptation and mitigation are illustrated in Figure 1.5. Because
there is already a commitment to a signiﬁcant degree of climate change,
a need for signiﬁcant adaptation is apparent. That need will continue to
increase through the twenty-ﬁrst century, an increase that will eventually
be molliﬁed as the effects of mitigation begin to bite. Mitigation is beginning now but the degree of mitigation that is eventually undertaken
will depend on an assessment of the effectiveness and cost of adaptation.
The costs, disadvantages and beneﬁts of both adaptation and mitigation
need therefore to be assessed and weighed against each other.
At the end of Chapter 7, estimates of the cost of damage from global
warming were presented. Many of these estimates of damage cost also
included some of the costs of adaptation; in general adaptation costs have
not been separately identiﬁed. Many of these cost estimates assumed
a situation for which, resulting from human activities, the increase in
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was equivalent to a doubling of the
carbon dioxide concentration – under business-as-usual this is likely to
occur around the middle of the twenty-ﬁrst century. The estimates were
typically around one to two per cent of gross domestic product (GDP)
for developed countries. In developing countries, because of their greater
vulnerability to climate change and because a greater proportion of their
expenditure is dependent on activities such as agriculture and water,
estimates of the cost of damage are greater, typically about ﬁve per cent
of GDP or more. At the present stage of knowledge, these estimates
are bound to be crude and subject to large uncertainties; nevertheless,
they give a feel for the likely range of cost. It was also pointed out in
Chapter 7 that the cost estimates only included those items that could
be costed in money terms. Those items of damage or disturbance for
which money is not an appropriate measure (e.g. the generation of large
numbers of environmental refugees) also need to be to exposed and taken
into account in any overall appraisal.
The longer-term damage, should greenhouse gases more than double
in concentration, is likely to rise somewhat more steeply in relation to the
concentration of carbon dioxide (Figure 9.3). For quadrupled equivalent
carbon dioxide concentration, for instance, estimates of damage cost
of the order of two to four times that for doubled carbon dioxide have
been made – suggesting that the damage might follow something like a
quadratic law relative to the expected temperature rise.9 In addition the

Some global economics

much larger degree of climate change would considerably enhance the
possibilities of singular events (see Table 7.4), irreversible change and
of possible surprises.
Since the main contribution to global warming arises from carbon
dioxide emissions, attempts have also been made to express these costs
in terms of the cost per tonne of carbon as carbon dioxide emitted from
human activities. A simple, but crude calculation can be carried out as
follows. Consider the situation when carbon dioxide concentration in
the atmosphere has doubled from its pre-industrial value, which will
occur when an additional amount of carbon as carbon dioxide of about
800 Gt from anthropogenic sources has been emitted into the atmosphere
(see Figure 3.1 and recall that about half the carbon dioxide emitted
accumulates in the atmosphere). This carbon dioxide will remain in the
atmosphere on average for about one hundred years. Assuming a ﬁgure
of two per cent of global world product (GWP) – or $US 600 billion per
annum – as the cost of the damage due to global warming in that situation,
and assuming also that the damage remains over the one hundred years
of the life-time of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the cost per tonne
of carbon turns out to be about $US 70.
Calculations of the cost per tonne of carbon can be made with much
more sophistication by considering that it is the incremental damage cost
(that is, the cost of the damage due to one extra tonne of carbon emitted
now) that is really required and also by allowing through a discount rate
for the fact that it is damage some time in the future that is being costed
now. Estimates made by different economists then range over $US 5–125
per tonne of carbon10 – the very large range being due to the different assumptions that have been made. The estimates are particularly sensitive
to the discount rate that is assumed; values at the top end of the range
above about $US 50 have assumed a discount rate of less than two per
cent; those at the bottom end have assumed a discount rate around ﬁve
per cent.11 The dominant effect of the discount rate will be clear when it
is realised that over ﬁfty years a two per cent discount rate devalues costs

by a factor of about three while a ﬁve per cent rate discounts by a factor
of thirteen. Over one hundred years the difference is even larger – a factor of seven for a two per cent rate and a factor of 170 for a ﬁve per cent
rate. Amongst economists there has been much debate but no agreement
about how to apply discount accounting to long-term problems of this
sort or about what rate is most appropriate. However, as Partha Dasgupta
points out,12 ‘the disagreement is not about economics nor about social
cost-beneﬁt analysis nor even about the numeracy of fellow scientists’.
He explains, for instance, that the effects of carbon emissions could make
substantial negative perturbations on future economies thus threatening
the basis on which discount rates for future investment are set. Further,
there are the likely damages that cannot easily be valued in money terms
such as the large-scale loss of land – or even of whole countries – due
to sea level rise or the large-scale loss of habitats or species. For these,
even if valuation is attempted, discounting seems inappropriate. There
seem cogent arguments that, if discount rates are applied to cost estimating for climate change, a smaller discount rate rather than a larger
one should be employed. And in any case, for any cost estimate that
is made the discount rate used should be adequately exposed. For our
broad economic arguments in later chapters we shall therefore quote an
estimate of damage cost in the range $US 50 to $US 100 per tonne of
carbon emitted as carbon dioxide.
To slow the onset of climate change and to limit the longer-term
damage, mitigating action can be taken by reducing greenhouse gas
emissions, in particular the emissions of carbon dioxide. The cost of
mitigation is very dependent on the amount of reduction required in
greenhouse gas emissions; large reductions will cost proportionately
more than small ones. It will also depend on the timescale of reduction.
To reduce emissions drastically in the very near term would inevitably
mean large reductions in energy availability with signiﬁcant disruption
to industry and large cost. However, more gradual reductions can be
made with relatively small cost through actions of two kinds. Firstly,
substantial efﬁciency gains in the use of energy can easily be achieved,
many of which would lead to cost savings; these can be put into train now.
Secondly, in the generation of energy, again proven technology exists
for substantial efﬁciency improvements and also for the bringing into
use of renewable sources of energy generation that are not dependent on
fossil fuels. These can be planned for now and changes made as energy
infrastructure, which has a typical life of thirty years or so, becomes
ready for replacement. The next two chapters will present more detail
about these possible actions and how they might be achieved.
Our purpose here is to look brieﬂy at the likely overall cost of mitigation, much of which will arise in the energy or the transport sectors as

cheap fossil fuels are replaced by other energy sources that, at least in
the short term, are likely to be more expensive. Some detail is provided
in the next chapter of the proﬁle of reductions in emissions that are
required to stabilise carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere
at different levels over the next one or two hundred years. Figure 9.4
presents estimates from six economic models of the cost to the world’s
economy in the year 2050 of these reductions. As might be expected,
the cost is substantially dependent on the target level of carbon dioxide
concentration stabilisation. It is also dependent on the baseline scenario
that is assumed. With typical levels of economic growth being between
two and four per cent per annum, the cost of achieving reductions to
meet any of the stabilisation levels in the ﬁgure, even that at 450 ppm,
is less than one year’s economic growth over ﬁfty years.
However, it should be noted that, even if the carbon dioxide concentration is stabilised at 450 or 500 ppm, remembering that the effect
of increases in the other greenhouse gases also has to be included (see
Chapter 10, page 259), the world will have been committed to a signiﬁcant degree of climate change (close to equivalent to doubling of
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration), bringing with it substantial
costs and demands for adaptation. What is being mitigated is further and
even more damaging climate change.
Although the economic studies I have mentioned have attempted
to take into account many of the relevant factors, they are bound to be
surrounded by substantial uncertainty. For instance, they have mostly

750

236

Weighing the uncertainty

not rigorously accounted for the economic effects of introducing new
low-emission technologies, new revenue-raising instruments or adequate
inter-regional ﬁnancial and technology transfers, all elements which contribute to lower costs.13 Further, one of the most difﬁcult factors to take
into account is that of likely future innovation. It is not easy to peer into
the crystal ball of technical development; almost any attempt to do so is
likely to underestimate its potential. For these reasons the estimates of
mitigation cost are almost certainly on the high side.
The models that have been used to make the estimates of cost have
all addressed limited parts of the whole problem. A complete assessment
needs to address more completely the interactions between the factors
that are driving climate change and its impacts both on humans and
ecosystems, the human activities that are inﬂuencing those factors and
the response to climate change both of humans and ecosystems – in fact
all the elements illustrated in Figure 1.5. This is often called Integrated
Assessment (see box below) and is supported by Integrated Assessment
Models (IAMs) that are currently being built to address all the relevant
elements in a more complete manner.
In considering the costs of the impacts of both global warming and
adaptation or mitigation, ﬁgures of a small percentage of GDP have been
mentioned. It is interesting to compare this with other items of expenditure in national or personal budgets. In a typical developed country, for
example the United Kingdom, about ﬁve per cent of national income is
spent on the supply of primary energy (basic fuel such as coal, oil and
gas, fuel for electricity supply and fuel for transport), about nine per cent
on health and three to four per cent on defence. It is, of course, clear that
global warming is strongly linked to energy production – it is because of
the way energy is provided that the problem exists – and this subject will
be expanded in the next two chapters. But the impacts of global warming
also have implications for health – such as the possible spread of disease –
and for national security – for example, the possibility of wars fought
over water, or the impact of large numbers of environmental refugees.
Any thorough consideration of the economics of global warming needs
therefore to assess the strength of these implications and to take them
into account in the overall economic balance.
So far, on the global warming balance sheet we have estimates of
costs and of beneﬁts or drawbacks. What we do not have as yet is a capital
account. Valuing human-made capital is commonplace, but in the overall
accounting we are attempting, ‘natural’ capital must clearly be valued
too. By ‘natural’ capital is meant, for instance, natural resources that
may be renewable (such as a forest) or non-renewable (such as coal, oil
or minerals).16 Their value is clearly more than the cost of exploitation
or extraction.

Integrated Assessment and Evaluation14
In the assessment and evaluation of the impacts of
different aspects of global climate change with its
large complexity, it is essential that all components
are properly addressed. The major components are
illustrated in Figure 1.5. They involve a very wide
range of disciplines from natural sciences, technology, economics and the social sciences (including
ethics). Take the example of sea level rise – probably
the easiest impact to envisage and to quantify. From
the natural sciences, estimates can be made of the
amount and rate of rise and its characteristics. From
various technologies, options for adaptation can be
proposed. From economics and the social sciences,
risks can be assessed and evaluated. The economic
costs of sea level rise might be expressed, for instance, most simply as the capital cost of protection
(where protection is possible) plus the economic
value of the land or structures that may be lost
plus the cost of rehabilitating those persons that
could be displaced. But in practice the situation is
more complex. For a costing to be at all realistic,
especially when it is to apply to periods of decades
into the future, it must account not only for direct
damage and the cost of protection but also for a
range of options and possibilities for adaptation
other than direct protection. The likelihood of increased storm surges with the consequent damages
and the possibility of substantial loss of life need
also to be addressed. Further, there are other indirect consequences; for instance, the loss of fresh
water because of salination, the loss of wetlands
and associated ecosystems, wildlife or ﬁsheries
and the lives and jobs of people that would be affected in a variety of ways. In developed country
situations rough estimates of the costs of some of
these components can be made in money terms.
For developing countries, however, the possible
options can less easily be identiﬁed or weighed
and even rough estimates of costs cannot be
provided.

Integrated Assessment Models or IAMs are important tools for Integrated Assessment and Evaluation. They represent within one integrated numerical model the physical, chemical and biological
processes that control the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the physical processes that determine the effect of changing greenhouse gas concentrations on climate and sea level,
the biology and ecology of ecosystems (natural and
managed), the physical and human impacts of climate change and the socio-economics of adaptation
to and mitigation of climate change. Such models
are highly sophisticated and complex although
their components are bound to be very simpliﬁed.
They provide an important means for studying the
connections and interactions between the various
elements of the climate change problem. Because
of their complexity and because of the non-linear
nature of many of the interactions, a great deal of
care and skill is needed in interpreting the results
from such models.
A number of the components of impact, even
for the relatively simple situation of sea level rise,
cannot be readily costed in money terms. For instance, the loss of ecosystems or wildlife as it
impacts tourism can be expressed in money terms,
but there is no agreed way of setting a money measure for the longer-term loss or the intrinsic value
of unique systems. Or a further example is that,
although the cost of rehabilitation for displaced
people can be estimated, other social, security or
political consequences of displacement (e.g. in extreme cases the loss of whole islands or even whole
states) cannot be costed in terms of money. Any
appraisal therefore of impacts of anthropogenic climate change will have to draw together components
that are expressed in different ways or use different
measures. Policy and decision makers need to ﬁnd
ways of considering alongside each other all the
components that need to be aggregated in order to
make appropriate judgements.15

238

Weighing the uncertainty

Other items, some of which were mentioned at the end of Chapter 7,
such as natural amenity and the value of species, can also be considered
as ‘natural’ capital. I have argued (Chapter 8) that there is intrinsic value
in the natural world – indeed, the value and importance of such ‘natural’
capital is increasingly recognised. The difﬁculty is that it is neither possible nor appropriate to express much of this value in money. Despite
this difﬁculty, it is now widely recognised that national and global indicators of sustainable development should be prepared that include items
of ‘natural’ capital and ways of including such items in national balance
sheets are being actively pursued.
In summary, the items in the overall global warming balance sheet
that have been identiﬁed are:
r Estimates of cost (for those items which can be quantiﬁed in terms of
money) of the likely impacts of anthropogenic climate change. Most
of the estimates to date have costed the impacts supposing the equivalent atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration were to double (which
could occur during the second half of the twenty-ﬁrst century). When
some allowance is also included for the costs of extreme events (see
Chapter 7, page 179) they are typically around one to two per cent
of GDP in developed countries and typically ﬁve per cent or more in
developing countries.
r Estimates of the cost of adaptation to anthropogenic climate change.
Signiﬁcant levels of adaptation will be required to the substantial degree of climate change to which the world is already committed. Even
if the maximum possible mitigation takes place, because of the long
time constants of change, the requirement for adaptation will continue
for many centuries into the future, for instance to respond to the sea
level rise that will continue for many centuries. Very few estimates
have, as yet, been made of adaptation costs, although a few such costs
are included in some of the impact studies.
r Estimates of the impacts of anthropogenic climate change that are difﬁcult if not impossible to value in money terms; for instance, those with
social consequences, those that affect human amenity and ‘natural’
capital or those that have implications for national security.
r Estimates of the cost of mitigation of anthropogenic climate change.
For reductions in emissions leading to stabilisation of atmospheric
carbon dioxide concentration (even at a level as low as 450 ppm –
doubled pre-industrial carbon dioxide is 560 ppm) these are typically
less than one year’s economic growth by 2050.
There is already international acceptance that action to mitigate
global warming is necessary. Such ‘weighing’ of the economics as has
been possible so far brings two messages – that action must begin now to

Questions

reduce emissions and slow the rate of change; that emissions of greenhouse gases up to the present have already produced a commitment to
signiﬁcant climate change over the next decades implying substantial requirements for adaptation and that more substantial emissions reductions
will eventually be required for which planning must begin now.
The next chapter will consider some of the actions in more detail in
the light of the principles we have enunciated in this chapter and in the
context of the international Framework Convention on Climate Change.

It is sometimes argued that, in scientiﬁc enquiry, ‘consensus’ can never be
achieved, because debate and controversy are fundamental to the search
for scientiﬁc truth. Discuss what is meant by ‘consensus’ and whether you
agree with this argument. Do you think the IPCC Reports have achieved
‘consensus’?
How much do you think the value of IPCC Reports depends on (1) the peer
review process to which they have been subjected, and (2) the involvement
of governments in the presentation of scientiﬁc results?
Look out as many deﬁnitions of ‘sustainable development’ as you can ﬁnd.
Discuss which you think is the best.
Make a list of appropriate indicators that might be used to assess the degree
to which a country is achieving sustainable development. Which do you think
might be the most valuable?
Work out the value of a ‘cost’ today if it is twenty, ﬁfty or one hundred
years into the future and the assumed discount rate is one, two or ﬁve per
cent. Look up and summarise the arguments for discounting future costs as
presented for instance in various chapters of the IPCC 1995 and the IPCC
2001 Reports.17 What do you think is the most appropriate discount rate to
use?
Construct, as far as you are able, a set of environmental accounts for your
country including items of ‘natural’ capital. Your accounts will not necessarily be all in terms of money.
Because of continuing economic growth, there is an expectation that the
world will be very much richer by the middle of the twenty-ﬁrst century
and therefore, it is sometimes argued, in a better position than now to tackle
the impacts or the mitigation of climate change. Do you agree with this
argument?

Chapter 10

A strategy for action to slow
and stabilise climate change

Following the awareness of the problems of climate change aroused
by the IPCC scientiﬁc assessments, the necessity of international action
has been recognised. In this chapter I address the forms that action could
take.

The climate convention
The United Nations Framework Convention on climate change signed by
over 160 countries at the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 came into force on 21
March 1994. It has set the agenda for action to slow and stabilise climate
change. The signatories to the Convention (some of the detailed wording
is presented in the box below) recognised the reality of global warming,
recognised also the uncertainties associated with current predictions of
climate change, agreed that action to mitigate the effects of climate
change needs to be taken and pointed out that developed countries should
take the lead in this action.
The Convention mentions one particular aim concerned with the
relatively short-term and one far reaching objective. The particular aim
is that developed countries (Annex I countries in Climate Convention
parlance) should take action to return greenhouse gas emissions, in particular those of carbon dioxide, to their 1990 levels by the year 2000.
The long-term objective of the Convention, expressed in Article 2, is
that the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere should be
stabilised ‘at a level which would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system’, the stabilisation to be achieved within
242

Some extracts from the United Nations Framework Convention on climate
change, signed by over 160 countries in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992
Firstly, some of the paragraphs in its preamble,
where the parties to the Convention:
CONCERNED that human activities have been
substantially increasing the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, that these increases enhance the natural greenhouse effect, and that this
will result on average in an additional warming of
the Earth’s surface and atmosphere and may adversely affect natural ecosystems and humankind.
NOTING that the largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries, that per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low
and that the share of global emissions originating in
developing countries will grow to meet their social
and development needs.
RECOGNISING that various actions to address climate change can be justiﬁed economically in their
own right and can also help in solving other environmental problems.
RECOGNISING that low-lying and other small island countries, countries with low-lying coastal,
arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to ﬂoods,
drought and desertiﬁcation, and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate
change.
AFFIRMING that responses to climate change
should be coordinated with social and economic
development in an integrated manner with a view
to avoiding adverse impacts on the latter, taking into
full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for the achievement of sustained
economic growth and the eradication of poverty.
DETERMINED to protect the climate system for
present and future generations, have AGREED as
follows:
The Objective of the Convention is contained in
Article 2 and reads as follows:
The ultimate objective of this Convention and any
related legal instruments that the Conference of
the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Convention,
stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations
in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent

dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
climate system. Such a level should be achieved
within a time frame sufﬁcient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and
to enable economic development to proceed in a
sustainable manner.
Article 3 deals with principles and includes agreement that the Parties:
take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate change
and mitigate its adverse effects. Where there are
threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of
full scientiﬁc certainty should not be used as a
reason for postponing such measures, taking into
account that policies and measures to deal with
climate change should be cost-effective so as to
ensure global beneﬁts at the lowest possible cost.
Article 4 is concerned with Commitments. In this
article, each of the signatories to the Convention
agreed:
to adopt national policies and take corresponding
measures on the mitigation of climate change, by
limiting its anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and protecting and enhancing its
greenhouse sinks and reservoirs. These policies
and measures will demonstrate that developed
countries are taking the lead in modifying longerterm trends in anthropogenic emissions consistent with the objective of the Convention, recognizing that the return by the end of the present
decade to earlier levels of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol
would contribute to such modiﬁcation . . .
Each signatory also agreed:
in order to promote progress to this end . . . to
communicate . . . detailed information on its policies and measures referred to above, as well as
on its resulting projected anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not covered by the Montreal Protocol . . . with the aim of returning individually or
jointly to their 1990 levels these . . . emissions . . .

A strategy for action to slow and stabilise climate change

a time-frame sufﬁcient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate
change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable
economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner. In setting this
objective, the Convention has recognised that it is only by stabilising the
concentration of greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide) in the
atmosphere that the rapid climate change which is expected to occur
with global warming can be halted.
Up to the end of 2003, nine sessions of the Conference of the Parties to the Climate Convention have taken place. Those since November
1997 have largely been concerned with the Kyoto Protocol, the ﬁrst
formal binding legislation promulgated under the Convention. The following paragraphs will ﬁrst outline the actions taken so far, then describe the Kyoto Protocol and address the further actions necessary
to satisfy the Convention’s objective to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations. Scientiﬁc and technical details of the options available
to achieve the reductions in emissions required will be described in
Chapter 11.

Stabilisation of emissions
The target for short-term action proposed for developed countries by
the Climate Convention was that, by the year 2000, greenhouse gas
emissions should be brought back to no more than their 1990 levels.
In the run-up to the Rio conference, before the Climate Convention
was formulated, many developed countries had already announced their
intention to meet such a target at least for carbon dioxide. They would do
this mainly through energy-saving measures, through switching to fuels
such as natural gas, which for the same energy production generates
forty per cent less carbon dioxide than coal and twenty-ﬁve per cent less
than oil. In addition those countries with traditional heavy industries
(e.g. the iron and steel industry) were experiencing large changes which
signiﬁcantly reduce fossil fuel use. More detail of these energy-saving
measures are given in the next chapter, which is devoted to a discussion
of future energy needs and production.
By the year 2000, compared with 1990, global emissions from fossil
fuel burning had risen by ten per cent. There was great variation between
the emissions from different countries. In the USA they rose by seventeen
per cent, in the rest of the OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development) they rose on average by ﬁve per cent. Emissions in
countries in the former Soviet Union (FSU – also often called Economies
in Transition) fell by around forty per cent because of the collapse of
their economies, while the total of emissions from developing countries

The Montreal Protocol

increased by around thirty-seven per cent (China and India by about
nineteen and sixty-eight per cent respectively).
As we shall learn later in the chapter, stabilisation of carbon dioxide
emissions would not lead in the foreseeable future to stabilisation of
atmospheric concentrations. Stabilisation of emissions could only be a
short-term aim. In the longer term much more substantial reductions of
emissions are necessary.

The Montreal Protocol
The chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs) are greenhouse gases whose emissions
into the atmosphere are already controlled under the Montreal Protocol
on ozone-depleting substances. This control has not arisen because
of their potential as greenhouse gases, but because they deplete
atmospheric ozone (see Chapter 3). Emissions of CFCs have fallen
sharply during the last few years and the growth in their concentrations
has slowed; for some CFCs a slight decline in their concentration is now
apparent. The phase-out of their manufacture in industrialised countries
by 1996 and in developing countries by 2006 as required by the 1992
amendments to the Montreal Protocol will ensure that the proﬁle of their
atmospheric concentration will continue to decline. However, because
of their long life in the atmosphere this decline will be slow; it will be a
century or more before their contribution to global warming is reduced
to a negligible amount.
The replacements for CFCs – the hydrochloro-ﬂuorocarbons
(HCFCs), which are also greenhouse gases though less potent than the
CFCs – are required to be phased out by 2030. It will probably be close to
that date before their atmospheric concentration stops rising and begins
to decline.
Because of the international agreements which now exist for control
of the production of the CFCs and many of the related species that
contribute to the greenhouse effect, for these gases the stabilisation of
atmospheric concentration required by the Climate Convention will in
due course be achieved.
Other replacements for CFCs are the hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs),
which are greenhouse gases but not ozone-depleting. The controls of
the Montreal Protocol do not therefore apply and, as was mentioned in
Chapter 3, any substantial growth in HFCs needs to be evaluated along
with the other greenhouse gases. As we shall see in the next section, they
are included in the ‘basket’ of greenhouse gases addressed by the Kyoto
Protocol.

The Kyoto Protocol
At the ﬁrst meeting after its entry into force held in Berlin in 1995,
the Parties to the Climate Convention (i.e. all the countries that had
ratiﬁed it) decided that they needed to negotiate a more speciﬁc and
quantiﬁed agreement than the Convention on its own provided. Because
of the principle in the Convention that industrialised countries should
take the lead, a Protocol was formulated that required commitments from
these countries (known as Annex I countries) for speciﬁc quantitative
reductions in emissions (listed in Table 10.1) from their level in 1990
to their average from 2008–12, called the ﬁrst commitment period. The
Protocol also required that a second commitment period be deﬁned for
which negotiations must start no later than 2005. The Protocol carries
inbuilt mechanisms that could lead to stronger action and be expanded
over time to include developing countries.
The basic structure of the Protocol and the commitments required
by different countries were agreed at a meeting of the Conference of the
Parties in Kyoto in November 1997. But the Protocol is a highly complex
agreement and over the next three years intense negotiations followed
regarding the details – the range of gases covered, the basis for comparing
them and the rules for monitoring, reporting and compliance. Further the
Protocol incorporates a range of mechanisms (see box below) of a kind

that are unprecedented in an international treaty and that enable countries
to offset their domestic emission obligations against the absorption of
emissions by ‘sinks’ (e.g. through forestation) or by investment in or
trading with other countries where it might be cheaper to limit emissions.
The emissions controlled by the Protocol are from six greenhouse
gases (Table 10.2) that can be converted into an amount of carbondioxide-equivalent through the use of their global warming potentials
(GWPs) which were introduced in Chapter 3 page 52.
The details of the Protocol were ﬁnally agreed at a meeting of the
Conference of the Parties in Marrakesh in October/November 2001.
Much of the detailed discussion related to the inclusion of carbon
sinks, especially from forests and from land-use change. Because of the
large uncertainties regarding the magnitude of such sinks, considerable
doubts were expressed regarding their inclusion in the Protocol arrangements. However, it was agreed that they should be included in a limited
way and detailed regulations were agreed concerning the inclusion of

247

248

A strategy for action to slow and stabilise climate change

afforestation, reforestation and deforestation activities and certain kinds
of land-use change. Capping arrangements were also set up that limit
the extent to which removals of carbon dioxide from these activities are
allowed to offset emissions elsewhere.1

The Kyoto mechanisms
The Kyoto Protocol includes three special mechanisms to assist in emissions reductions.
Joint implementation (JI) allows industrialised countries to implement
projects that reduce emissions or increase removals by sinks in the territories of other industrialised countries. Emissions reduction units generated by such projects can then be used by investing Annex I countries
to help meet their emission targets. Examples of JI projects could be the
replacement of a coal-ﬁred power plant with a more efﬁcient combined
heat and power plant or the reforestation of an area of land. JI projects are
expected to be mainly in EIT (economies in transition) countries where
there is more scope for cutting emissions at low cost.
The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) allows industrialised
countries to implement projects that reduce emissions in developing
countries. The certiﬁed emission reductions generated can be used by
industrialised countries to help meet their emission targets, while the
projects also help developing countries to achieve sustainable development and contribute to the objective of the Convention. Examples of
CDM projects could be a rural electriﬁcation project using solar panels
or the reforestation of degraded land.
Emissions Trading allows industrialised countries to purchase ‘assigned
amount units’ of emissions from other industrialised countries that ﬁnd it
easier, relatively speaking, to meet their emissions targets. This enables
countries to utilise lower cost opportunities to curb emissions or increase
removals, irrespective of where those opportunities exist, in order to
reduce the overall cost of mitigating climate change.
The detailed regulations concerning the implementation of these mechanisms state that projects will only be approved if they lead to real,
measurable and long-term beneﬁts related to the mitigation of climate
change and that they are additional to any that would have occurred
without the project.

Before the Marrakesh meeting in 2001 the United States had announced its withdrawal from the Protocol. Despite this by the end of
2003 120 countries had ratiﬁed the Protocol and the Annex I countries
that had ratiﬁed represented 44% of Annex I country emissions. For the

Forests

Protocol to come into force ﬁfty-ﬁve countries have to ratify together
with sufﬁcient Annex I countries to represent ﬁfty-ﬁve per cent of Annex
I country emissions. With ratiﬁcation by Russia towards the end of 2004,
the Protocol will come into force on 16 February 2005.
Concern has often been expressed about the likely cost of implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. Cost studies have been carried out using a
number of international energy-economic models. For nine such studies, the range of values in impacts on the gross domestic product (GDP)
of participating countries is as follows.2 In the absence of emissions
trading, estimated reductions in projected GDP in the year 2010 are between 0.2% and 2% compared with a base case with no implementation
of the Protocol. With emissions trading between Annex I countries, the
estimated reductions in GDP are between 0.1% and 1.1%. If emissions
trading with all countries is assumed through ideal CDM (see box below) implementation, the estimated reductions in GDP are substantially
less – between 0.01% and 0.7%. Although there are differences between
countries, most of the large range in the results is due to differences in the
models and can be considered as an expression of the large uncertainties
inherent in such studies at the present stage of development.
The Kyoto Protocol is an important start to the mitigation of climate change through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. With its
complexity and its diversity of mechanisms for implementation, it also
represents a considerable achievement in international negotiation and
agreement. It will stem the continuing growth of emissions from many
industrialised countries and achieve a reduction overall compared with
1990 from those Annex I countries that participate. The much more substantial longer-term reductions that are likely to be necessary for the
decades that follow the ﬁrst commitment period will be discussed later
in the chapter.

Forests
We now turn to the situation of the world’s forests and the contribution
that they can make to the mitigation of global warming. Action here can
easily be taken now and is commendable for many other reasons.
Over the past few centuries many countries, especially those at mid
latitudes, have removed much of their forest cover to make room for
agriculture. Many of the largest and most critical remaining forested
areas are in the tropics. However, during the last few decades, the additional needs of the increasing populations of developing countries for
agricultural land and for fuelwood, together with the rise in demand for
tropical hardwoods by developed countries, has led to a worrying rate
of loss of forest in tropical regions (see box below). In many tropical

249

250

A strategy for action to slow and stabilise climate change

countries the development of forest areas has been the only hope of
subsistence for many people. Unfortunately, because the soils and other
conditions were often inappropriate, some of this forest clearance has not
led to sustainable agriculture but to serious land and soil degradation.3
Measurements on the ground and observations from orbiting satellites have been combined to provide estimates of the area of tropical
forest lost. Over the decades of the 1980s4 and 1990s the average loss
was about one per cent per year (see box below) although in some
areas it was considerably higher. Such rates of loss cannot be sustained
if much forest is to be left in ﬁfty or a hundred years’ time. The loss of
forests is damaging, not only because of the ensuing land degradation
but also because of the contribution that loss makes to carbon emissions
and therefore to global warming. There is also the dramatic loss in biodiversity (it is estimated that over half the world’s species live in tropical
forests) and the potential damage to regional climates (loss of forests can
lead to a signiﬁcant regional reduction in rainfall – see box on page 173).
For every square kilometre of a typical tropical forest there is about
25 000 tonnes of biomass (total living material) above ground, containing
about 12 000 tonnes of carbon.6 It is estimated that burning or other
destruction from deforestation turns about two-thirds of this carbon into
carbon dioxide. Approximately the same amount of carbon is also stored
below the surface in the soil. On this basis, from the destruction of about

The world’s forests and deforestation5
The total area covered by forest is almost one-third of the world’s land
area, of which ninety-ﬁve per cent is natural forest and ﬁve per cent
planted forest. About forty-seven per cent of forests worldwide are tropical, nine per cent subtropical, eleven per cent temperate and thirty-three
per cent boreal.
At the global level, the net loss in forest area during the 1990s was an
estimated 940 000 km2 (2.4% of total forest area). This was the combined
effect of a deforestation rate of about 150 000 km2 per year and a rate of
forest increase of about 50 000 km2 per year. Deforestation of tropical
forests averaged about one per cent per year.
The area under forest plantations grew by an average of about
3000 km2 per year during the 1990s. Half of this increase was the result
of afforestation on land previously under non-forest land use, whereas
the other half resulted from conversion of natural forest.
In the 1990s, almost seventy per cent of deforested areas changed
to agricultural land, predominantly under permanent rather than shifting
systems.

Forests

150 000 km2 per annum over the decades of the 1980s and 1990s (see
box above) about 1.2 Gt of carbon would enter the atmosphere as carbon
dioxide. Although there are substantial uncertainties in the numbers,
they approximately tally with the IPCC estimate, quoted in Chapter 3
(see Table 3.1), of the carbon as carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere
each year from land-use change (mostly deforestation) of 1.7 ± 0.8 Gt
per year – a signiﬁcant fraction of the current total emissions of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere from human activities.
Reducing deforestation can therefore make a substantial contribution
to slowing the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, as well as
the provision of other beneﬁts such as guarding biodiversity and avoiding
soil degradation. These beneﬁts are being increasingly recognised and
developing countries in tropical regions where there are large areas of
natural forest are beginning to concentrate seriously on the management
of their forests, on limiting the extent of deforestation or planning for
substantial afforestation. Other large areas of forest lie at higher latitudes
where developed countries are also taking action to increase forest area
so as to contribute to the mitigation of global warming.
Let us look at the possibilities for afforestation. For every square
kilometre, a growing forest ﬁxes between about 100 and 600 tonnes of
carbon per year for a tropical forest and between about 100 and 250
tonnes for a boreal forest.7 To illustrate the effect of afforestation on
atmospheric carbon dioxide, suppose that an area of 100 000 km2 , a little
more than the area of the island of Ireland, were planted each year for
forty years – starting now. By the year 2045, 4 000 000 km2 would have
been planted; that is roughly half the area of Australia. During that forty
years, the forests would continue to grow and uptake carbon for twenty
to ﬁfty years or more after planting (the actual period depending on the
type of forest and site conditions) – and, assuming a mixture of tropical,
temperate and boreal forest, between about 20 and 50 Gt of carbon
from the atmosphere would have been sequestered. This accumulation of
carbon in the forests is equivalent to between about ﬁve and ten per cent
of the likely emissions due to fossil fuel burning up to 2045.
But is such a tree planting programme feasible and is land on the scale
required available? The answer is almost certainly, yes. Studies have been
carried out that have identiﬁed land which is not presently being used for
croplands or settlements, much of which has supported forests in the past,
of an area totalling about 3 500 000 km2 .8 About 2 200 000 km2 of this
total is land that is technically suitable at mid and high latitudes – all of
this is deemed to be available. In tropical regions, of the 22 000 000 km2
actually deemed suitable, only six per cent or 1 300 000 km2 is considered to be actually available because of additional cultural, social and
economic constraints. These studies have also considered in detail how

251

252

A strategy for action to slow and stabilise climate change

much carbon could be sequestered between the years 1995 and 2050 by
a programme of afforestation on this land. It is estimated to be between
50 and 70 Gt of carbon, to which a further 10–20 Gt can be added if the
rate of tropical deforestation were to be slowed. Estimates of the cost of
carrying out the programme have also emerged from the studies; they
are considerably lower than those estimated earlier in the 1990s. When
expressed per tonne of carbon sequestered they typically fall between
$US 1 and 10 (the lower values in developing countries) not including land and transaction costs, but also not including the value of local
beneﬁts (for instance, watershed protection, maintenance of biodiversity, education, tourism and recreation) which might be derived from
the programme and which, in some circumstances, might offset most of
the programme’s cost. Compare this ﬁgure with the estimate given in
Chapter 9 of between $US 50 and 100 for the cost per tonne of carbon
of the likely damage due to global warming. The programme therefore
appears as a potentially attractive one for alleviating the rate of change
of climate due to increasing greenhouse gases in the relatively short
term.
Let me insert here a note of caution. As with many environmental
projects the situation, however, may not be as simple as it seems at ﬁrst.
One complicating factor is that introducing forest can change the albedo9
of the Earth’s surface. Dark green forests absorb more of the incoming
solar radiation than arable cropland or grassland and so tend to warm the
surface. This is particularly noticeable in winter months when unforested
areas may possess highly reﬂecting snow cover. Calculations show that,
particularly at high latitudes, the warming due to this ‘albedo effect’ can
offset a signiﬁcant fraction of the cooling that arises from the additional
carbon sink provided by the forest.10
A possible afforestation programme has been presented in order to
illustrate the potential for carbon sequestration. Once the trees are fully
grown, of course, the sequestration ceases. What happens then depends
on the use that may be made of them. They may be ‘protection’ forests, for
instance for the control of erosion or for the maintenance of biodiversity;
or they may be production forests, used for biofuels or for industrial timber. If they are used as fuel for energy generation (see Chapter 11), they
add to the atmospheric carbon dioxide but, unlike fossil fuels, they are a
renewable resource. As with the rest of the biosphere where natural recycling takes place on a wide variety of timescales, carbon from wood fuel
can be continuously recycled through the biosphere and the atmosphere.
However, although there is a useful potential contribution from afforestation to the mitigation of climate change, it can only provide a
small part of what is required. An approximate upper bound for the

Reduction in the sources of methane

reduction that could be achieved in the twenty-ﬁrst century through the
enhancement of carbon uptake by land-use change has been estimated
at 40–70 ppm11 (equivalent to a storage of 85–150 Gt). Compare this
with the range in carbon dioxide concentration in 2100 of about 400 ppm
that results from different SRES emission scenarios (Figure 6.1) or with
the increase of up to 300 ppm by 2100 because of the possible effect of
climate-carbon cycle feedbacks (see Figure 3.5).

Reduction in the sources of methane
Methane is a less important greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, contributing perhaps ﬁfteen per cent to the present level of global warming.
The stabilisation of its atmospheric concentration would contribute a
small but signiﬁcant amount to the overall problem. Because of its much
shorter lifetime in the atmosphere (about twelve years compared with
100–200 years for carbon dioxide), only a relatively small reduction in
the anthropogenic emissions of this gas, about eight per cent, would be
required to stabilise its concentration at the current level.
In Figures 6.1 and 6.2 are shown the emissions and the atmospheric
concentrations of methane estimated for the various SRES scenarios,
assuming no special action to reduce them. Of the various sources of
methane listed in Table 3.3, there are three sources arising from human
activities that could rather easily be reduced at small cost.12 Firstly,
methane emission from biomass burning would be cut by, say, one-third
if deforestation were drastically curtailed.
Secondly, methane production from landﬁll sites could be cut by at
least a third if more waste were recycled or used for energy generation
by incineration or if arrangements were made on landﬁll sites for the
collection of methane gas (it could then be used for energy production
or if the quantity were insufﬁcient it could be ﬂared, turning the methane
into carbon dioxide which molecule-for-molecule is less effective than
methane as a greenhouse gas). Waste management policies in many
countries already include the encouragement of such measures.
Thirdly, the leakage from natural gas pipelines from mining and other
parts of the petrochemical industry could at little cost (probably even at
a saving in cost) also be reduced by, say, one-third. An illustration of the
scale of the leakage is provided by the suggestion that the closing down
of some Siberian pipelines, because of the major recession in Russia,
has been the cause of the fall in the growth of methane concentration
in the atmosphere from 1992 to 1993. Improved management of such
installations could markedly reduce leakage to the atmosphere, perhaps
by as much as one-quarter overall.

253

254

A strategy for action to slow and stabilise climate change

Fourthly, with better management, options exist for reducing
methane emissions from sources associated with agriculture.13
Reductions from these four sources could reduce anthropogenic
methane emissions by over 60 000 000 tonnes per annum which would
be more than adequate to stabilise the concentration of methane in the
atmosphere at about or below the current level. Put another way, the
reduction in methane emissions from these sources would be equivalent
to a reduction in annual carbon dioxide emissions producing about onethird of a gigatonne of carbon14 or a little less than ﬁve per cent of total
greenhouse gas emissions – a useful contribution towards the solution
of the global warming problem.
Because the lifetime of methane in the atmosphere is relatively short,
a small reduction in methane emissions will quickly lead to its stabilisation as required by the Climate Convention objective. The same, however,
is not true of the stabilisation of carbon dioxide concentration with its
much longer and rather complicated lifetime. It is to that we shall now
turn.

Stabilisation of carbon dioxide concentrations
Carbon dioxide, as we have seen, is the most important of the greenhouse
gases that result from human activities. Under all the SRES scenarios,
the concentration of carbon dioxide rises continuously throughout the
twenty-ﬁrst century and apart from scenario B1 none come anywhere
near to stabilisation of concentration by 2100.
What sort of emissions scenario would stabilise the carbon dioxide
concentration? Suppose for instance that it were possible to keep global
emissions for the whole of the twenty-ﬁrst century at the same level as
in the year 2000, would that be enough? Stabilising concentrations is,
however, very different from stabilising emissions. With constant emissions after the year 2000, the concentration in the atmosphere would
continue to rise and would approach 500 ppm by the year 2100. After
that carbon cycle models predict that, because of the long time constants involved, the carbon dioxide concentration would still continue to
increase, although more slowly, for many centuries.
Examples of scenarios that would lead to stabilisation of atmospheric
carbon dioxide concentration at different levels are shown in Figure 10.1.
Note that stabilisation at any level shown in the ﬁgure, even at an extremely high level, requires that anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions
eventually fall to a small fraction of current emissions. This highlights
the fact that to maintain a constant future carbon dioxide concentration, emissions must be no greater than the level of persistent natural

Stabilisation of carbon dioxide concentrations

sinks. The main known such sink is due to the dissolution of calcium
carbonate from the oceans into ocean sediments that, for high levels of
carbon dioxide concentration, is probably less than 0.1 Gt per year.15
In the work presented in Figure 10.1, many different pathways to
stabilisation could have been chosen. The particular emission proﬁles
illustrated in Figure 10.1 begin by following the current average rate of
increase of emissions and then provide a smooth transition to the time of
stabilisation. To a ﬁrst approximation, the stabilised concentration level
depends more on the accumulated amount of carbon emitted up to the
time of stabilisation than on the exact concentration path followed en
route to stabilisation. This means that alternative pathways that might
assume higher emissions in earlier years would require steeper reductions in later years. Table 10.3 lists the accumulated emissions for the
period 2001–2100 for the different stabilisation proﬁles and also those
for the SRES scenarios. It shows that if the atmospheric concentration of
carbon dioxide is to remain below about 500 ppm, the future global annual emissions averaged over the twenty-ﬁrst century cannot exceed the
current level of global annual emissions. Figure 10.1(c) shows the projected global mean surface temperature response to the carbon dioxide
concentration proﬁles shown in Figure 10.1(a).
The main results shown in Table 10.3 do not include the effect of
climate feedbacks on the carbon cycle (see box in Chapter 3 on page 40).
Two of the feedbacks are important in the context of the consideration
of stabilisation scenarios; namely, increased respiration from the soil as
the temperature rises and die-back especially from forests as the climate
changes. As we saw in Chapter 3, the effect of these feedbacks could
lead to the biosphere becoming a substantial source of carbon dioxide
during the twenty-ﬁrst century. The size of that source will depend on
the amount of climate change. To take it into account, the accumulated
amount of that source has to be subtracted from the ﬁgures in Table 10.3
to arrive at the emissions from fossil fuel burning that would lead to
different stabilisation levels. Some of the estimates of what would need
to be subtracted are large – for instance, for the 450 ppm and 550 ppm
stabilisation scenarios, they are as large as 200 Gt and 300 Gt respectively
during the twenty-ﬁrst century.16 In which case, if these estimates are
conﬁrmed, emissions scenarios that are aiming at 450 ppm stabilisation
(but not allowing for the feedbacks), when the feedbacks are included,
would in fact achieve around 550 ppm, and aiming at 550 ppm would in
fact achieve around 750 ppm.
It is instructive also to look at annual emissions of carbon dioxide
expressed per capita. Averaged over the world in 2000 they were just
over one tonne (t) (as carbon) per capita but they varied very much from

country to country (Figure 10.2). For developed countries and transitional economy countries in 2000 they averaged 2.8 t (ranging downwards from about 5.5 t for the USA) while for developing countries they
averaged about 0.5 t. Looking ahead to the years 2050 and 2100, even if
the world population rises to only about seven billion (as with SRES scenarios A1 and B1) under the proﬁles of carbon dioxide emissions leading
to stabilisation at concentrations of 450 ppm and 550 ppm (Figure 10.1)
the per capita annual emissions averaged over the world would be about
0.6 t and 1.1 t respectively for 2050 and 0.3 and 0.7 t respectively for
210017 – much less than the current value of about 1 t.

The choice of stabilisation level
The last few sections have addressed the main greenhouse gases and how
their concentrations might be stabilised. To decide how the appropriate
stabilisation levels should be chosen as targets for the future we look
to the guidance provided by the Climate Convention Objective (see box

on page 243), which states that the levels and the timescales for their
achievement should be such that dangerous interference with the climate
system must be prevented, that ecosystems should be able to adapt naturally, that food production must not be threatened and that economic
development can proceed in a sustainable manner. We do not yet know
enough to pick precisely the levels or the timescales under the criteria
the Climate Convention is prescribing, but perhaps already some limits
can be set.
Firstly, considering the most important greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, as we have already noted its long life in the atmosphere provides
severe constraints on the future emission proﬁles that lead to stabilisation
at any level. It will be clear, for instance, from Figure 10.1 that stabilisation below about 400 ppm would require an almost immediate drastic
reduction in emissions. Such reduction could only be achieved at a large
cost and with some curtailment of energy availability and would almost
certainly breach the criterion which requires ‘that economic development
can proceed in a sustainable manner’.
What about the upper end of the choice of level? Here we refer
to the likely impacts of climate change under a situation in which the
atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has doubled from its preindustrial value of 280 ppm to about 560 ppm. Many of the impacts
described in Chapter 7 with their associated costs apply to this situation.
We also noted there that in estimating these costs there were components

The choice of stabilisation level

of the damage that could not be quantiﬁed in money terms. But even if
only the costs that can be estimated in terms of money are considered,
in Chapter 9 it was pointed out that estimates of the cost of the likely
damage of the impacts at that level of climate change were larger than the
costs of stabilising carbon dioxide concentration at levels above about
500 ppm (Figure 9.4). We also noted that, beyond the doubled carbon
dioxide situation, the damage due to greenhouse gas climate change is
likely to rise substantially more rapidly as the amount of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere increases. A further factor is the rate of climate change
(see Figure 10.1(c)) which, with all the proﬁles except possibly the two
lowest, is likely to be such that some important ecosystems may not be
able to adapt to it (see Chapter 7). Studies18 show that stabilisation below
550 ppm should avoid some of the worst impacts; for instance, some of
the large-scale die-back of forests and the transition of the biosphere
from a source to a sink for carbon dioxide (see box in Chapter 3 on page
40) which would otherwise occur around the middle of the twenty-ﬁrst
century. Considering carbon dioxide alone, these considerations suggest
that the range between about 400 ppm and 550 ppm is where further
careful consideration of the choice of the target stabilisation level should
be made.
Although carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas, other
gases also make a contribution to climate change. The combined effect
of the increases to 1990 of the gases methane, nitrous oxide and the
CFCs19 is to add a forcing equivalent to that from an additional 60 ppm
or so of carbon dioxide (see Chapter 6, page 124). The effect of these
other gases also needs to be taken into account in our overall discussion
of the Climate Convention Objective of stabilisation. Even if there were
no further increase in these minor gases, the 1990 forcing would still
require to be added to future projections of change. The effect of this,
if turned into equivalent amounts of carbon dioxide, would be that the
450 ppm carbon-dioxide-only level would become about 520 ppm and
the 550 ppm level would become about 640 ppm of equivalent carbon
dioxide.20 This means that, if it is considered that the climate effects of
doubled pre-industrial carbon dioxide concentration should be an upper
limit, when the increases in other gases are allowed for, the stabilisation
limit for carbon dioxide only is about 490 ppm.
How realistic is it to assume that the concentration of the other gases
will not change? We saw earlier that the Montreal Protocol should ensure
that the CFCs are stabilised in concentration over the next decade or two.
We also saw, for methane, that means are available that are not costly
and that, if taken, could stabilise methane concentrations at about today’s
levels. There is more uncertainty about nitrous oxide as its sources and
sinks are not well known. However, it is only a small contributor to

259

260

A strategy for action to slow and stabilise climate change

the forcing to date (equivalent to about 10 ppm of carbon dioxide); any
increase in the future is not likely to have a large effect.
In this simple argument regarding the inﬂuence of other gases on
the choice of a concentration level for carbon dioxide stabilisation that
might be acceptable under the terms of the Climate Convention Objective, the concept of equivalent carbon dioxide concentration has proved
a useful tool. But it must not be used blindly. For any detailed consideration of the choice of level, there are other scientiﬁc factors to be
included. Firstly, there are the other contributors to radiative forcing and
climate change; for instance, tropospheric ozone and aerosols that are
very inhomogeneous in their distribution. Their likely effect, although
small compared with that of carbon dioxide, also needs to be taken into
account. Secondly, there are the different regional climate responses and
different timescales of responses that result from the different greenhouse gases or from aerosols. Thirdly, there are the effects of particular
feedbacks (e.g. carbon dioxide fertilisation) or impacts (e.g. acid rain
from aerosols).
The choice of a target stabilisation level for greenhouse gases according to the criteria listed in the Objective of the Climate Convention
involves scientiﬁc, economic, social and political factors. In Chapter 9
(see box on page 237) the concept of Integrated Assessment and Evaluation was introduced that involves employment of the whole range of
disciplines in the natural and social sciences. Taking all factors into
consideration will involve different kinds of analysis, cost beneﬁt analysis (which was considered brieﬂy in Chapter 9), multicriteria analysis
(which takes into account factors that cannot be expressed in monetary
terms) and sustainability analysis (which considers avoidance of particular thresholds of stress or of damage). Further, because much uncertainty
is associated both with many of the factors that have to be included and
with the methods of analysis, the process of choice is bound to be an
evolving one subject to continuous review – a process often described
as sequential decision making.
Taking account of considerations such as those above, let me mention
statements that have come from two very different bodies regarding their
view of where the choice of a stabilisation level at the present time could
or should be made. Firstly, the European Union has proposed setting a
limit for the rise in global average temperature of 2 ◦ C.21 Since the best
estimate of global average temperature rise for doubled pre-industrial
carbon dioxide (560 ppm) is 2.5 ◦ C, a rise of 2 ◦ C would occur with a
carbon dioxide concentration of about 430 ppm allowing for the effect
of other gases at their 1990 levels. The second statement comes from
Lord John Browne, the Group Chief Executive of British Petroleum, one

Realising the Climate Convention Objective

of the world’s largest oil companies. He recognises the dangers of global
warming and the challenge it presents and has stated that, for carbon
dioxide, ‘stabilisation in the range 500–550 ppm is possible, and with
care could be achieved without disrupting economic growth.’22

Realising the Climate Convention Objective
Having decided on a choice of stabilisation level, a large question remains: how can the nations of the world work together to realise it in
practice?
The Objective of the Climate Convention is largely concerned with
factors associated with the requirement for sustainable development. In
Chapter 9, four principles were enunciated that should be at the basis
of negotiations concerned with future emissions reductions to mitigate
climate change. One of these was the Principle of Sustainable Development. The others were the Precautionary Principle, the Polluter-Pays
Principle and the Principle of Equity. This latter Principle includes intergenerational equity, or weighing the needs of the present generation
against those of future generations, and international equity, or weighing
the balance of need between industrial and developed nations and the developing world. Striking this latter balance is going to be particularly difﬁcult because of the great disparity in current carbon dioxide emissions
between the world’s richest nations and the poorest nations (Figure 10.2),
the continuing demand for fossil fuel use in the developed world and the
understandable desire of the poorer nations to escape from poverty
through development and industrialisation. This latter is particularly
recognised in the Framework Convention on Climate Change (see box at
the beginning of the chapter) where the growing energy needs of developing nations as they achieve industrial development are clearly stated.
An example of how the approach to stabilisation for carbon dioxide
might be achieved is illustrated in Figure 10.3. It is based on a proposal
called ‘Contraction and Convergence’ that originates with the Global
Commons Institute (GCI),23 a non-governmental organisation based in
the UK. The envelope of carbon dioxide emissions is one that leads to
stabilisation at 450 ppm (without climate feedbacks included), although
the rest of the proposal does not depend on that actual choice of level.
Note that, under this envelope, global fossil-fuel emissions rise by about
ﬁfteen per cent to about 2025; they then fall to less than half the current
level by 2100. The ﬁgure illustrates the division of emissions between
major countries or groups of countries as it has been up to the present.
Then the simplest possible solution is taken to the sharing of emissions
between countries and proposes that, from some suitable date (in the

Global Commons Institute for achieving stabilisation of carbon dioxide
concentration. The envelope of carbon dioxide emissions illustrated is one that
leads to stabilisation at 450 ppm (but the effect of climate carbon cycle
feedbacks is not included). For major countries or groups of countries, up to the
year 2000, historic emissions are shown. After 2030 allocations of emissions are
made on the basis of equal shares per capita on the basis of population
projections for that date. From now until 2030, smooth ’convergence’ from the
present situation to that of equal shares is assumed to occur. In the upper part of
the diagram the per capita contributions that apply to different countries or
groups of countries are shown. For OECD and FSU see Glossary.

ﬁgure, 2030 is chosen), emissions are allocated on the basis of equal
shares per capita. From now until 2030 the division is allowed to converge
from the present situation to that of equal per capita shares. Hence the
‘contraction and convergence’. The further proposal is that arrangements
to trade the carbon dioxide allocations are made.
The ‘Contraction and Convergence’ proposal addresses all of the four
principles mentioned above. In particular, through its equal per capita
sharing arrangements it addresses head-on the question of international
equity – and the proposed trading arrangements ensure that the greatest
‘polluters’ pay. Its simple and appealing logic means that it is a strong
candidate for providing a long-term solution. What has yet to be worked
is how the ‘convergence’ part of the proposal can be implemented, but
then any proposal for a solution will have to address the problem of
‘convergence’.
Another example of a pathway to stabilisation during the twenty-ﬁrst
century of carbon dioxide concentration is set out in a study sponsored

Summary of the action required

by the World Energy Council and published in 1993.24 An ‘ecologically
driven scenario’ – Scenario C – of global carbon dioxide emissions is
described that leads to stabilisation at about 450 ppm (without carbon
feedbacks included) – see Figure 11.4. Under that scenario, global carbon
dioxide emissions grow by about ten per cent (from 1990 levels) by
the year 2050; they then fall by sixty per cent by 2100 (Table 11.2).
For the ﬁrst two decades of the twenty-ﬁrst century, the World Energy
Council provide detailed projections for Scenario C that recognise the
requirement for international equity. Up to the year 2020, emissions
from fossil fuels in the developing world are allowed to approximately
double, while those from developed countries fall by about thirty per
cent (Figure 11.5). In 2020, global emissions from developing countries
would be sixty per cent of the total for the world compared with about
one-third in 1990. After 2020 reductions in emissions in all countries
would be required.
As the World Energy Council point out in their report, achievement
of such a scenario will be far from easy. It requires three essential ingredients. The ﬁrst is an aggressive emphasis on energy saving and conservation. Much here can be achieved at zero net cost or even at a cost
saving. Though much energy conservation can be shown to be economically advantageous, it is unlikely to be undertaken without signiﬁcant
incentives. However, it is clearly good in its own right, it can be started
in earnest now and it can make a signiﬁcant contribution to the reduction
of emissions and the slowing of global warming. The second ingredient
is an emphasis on the development of appropriate non-fossil fuel energy
sources leading to very rapid growth in their implementation. The third
is the transfer of technologies to developing countries that will enable
them to apply the most appropriate and the most efﬁcient technologies
to their industrial development, especially in the energy sector.

Summary of the action required
This chapter has suggested some actions that can be taken to slow climate
change and ultimately to stabilise it as required by the internationally
agreed Climate Convention.
Some actions have already been taken that have an effect on global
emissions of greenhouse gases, namely:
r the reduction by some countries of carbon dioxide emissions in the
year 2000 to 1990 levels, and
r the provisions of the Montreal Protocol regarding the emissions of
CFCs and CFC substitutes.

263

264

A strategy for action to slow and stabilise climate change

Other actions that can be taken now to slow climate change, that can be
done at little or no net cost and that are good to do for other reasons are
the following:

r

a reduction of deforestation,
a substantial increase in afforestation,
some relatively easy-to-do reductions in methane emissions,
an aggressive increase in energy saving and conservation measures,
increased implementation of renewable sources of energy supply.

For the longer term, as well as increased emphasis on these actions, the
world needs to begin to follow an energy scenario that will lead to the stabilisation of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. The choice
of a target stabilisation level following the guidance of the Climate Convention involves the consideration of many factors and, because of the
uncertainties, will necessarily be subject to continuous review. We have
presented arguments suggesting that, at the current state of knowledge,
the range 400–500 ppm in carbon dioxide concentration is where further
detailed consideration of costs and impacts should be concentrated. A
proposal called ‘Contraction and Convergence’ meets the requirement
for international equity through eventual agreement for equal allocations per capita coupled with arrangements for allocations’ trading. A
study by the World Energy Council has detailed an energy scenario that
would lead to the stabilisation of carbon dioxide concentration by about
2100. Its realisation will require very rapid growth in the implementation of appropriate non-fossil fuel energy sources; it will also require that
means be provided to enable developing countries to apply appropriate
and efﬁcient technologies to their industrial development, especially in
the energy sector – matters that will be addressed in detail in the next
chapter.
Questions
1 From Figure 10.1, what are the rates of change of global average temperature
for the proﬁles shown that lead to stabilisation of carbon dioxide concentration
at different levels? From information in Chapter 7 or from elsewhere, can you
suggest a criterion involving rate of change that might assist in the choice
of a stabilisation level for carbon dioxide concentration as required by the
Objective of the Climate Convention?
2 From the formula in Note 20 and the information in Figure 3.8 and Table 6.1,
calculate the contributions from the various components of radiative forcing
(including aerosol) to the equivalent carbon dioxide concentration in 1990.
How valid do you think is it to speak of equivalent carbon dioxide for components such as aerosol and tropospheric ozone?

Notes

3 From the information in Table 6.1 and the formula in Note 20, calculate
the equivalent carbon dioxide concentration including the well mixed greenhouse gases for SRES scenarios A1B and A2 in 2050 and 2100.
4 Associated with the choice of stabilisation level under the criteria of the
Objective of the Climate Convention, different kinds of analysis were mentioned; cost–beneﬁt analysis, multicriteria analysis and sustainability analysis. Discuss which analysis is most applicable to each of the criteria in the
Objective. Suggest how the analyses might be presented together so as to
assist in the overall choice.
5 From the information available in previous chapters and using the criteria
laid out in the Climate Convention Objective, what stabilisation levels of
greenhouse gas concentrations do you think should be chosen?
6 The arguments concerning the choice of stabilisation level and the action to
be taken have concentrated on the likely costs and impacts of climate change
before the year 2100. Do you think that information about continuing climate
change or sea level rise (see Chapter 7) after 2100 should be included and
taken into account by decision makers, or is that too far ahead to be of
importance?
7 The international response to global warming is likely to lead to decisions being taken sequentially over a number of years as knowledge regarding the science, the likely impacts and the possible responses becomes
more certain. Describe how you think the international response might
progress over the next twenty years. What decisions might be taken at what
time?
8 Explain how the ‘Contraction and Convergence’ proposal meets the four
principles listed in Chapter 9 and elaborated in Chapter 10. Suggest the
political or economic arguments that might be used to argue against the
proposal. Can you suggest other ways of sharing emissions between countries
that might achieve agreement more easily?
9 Find out the details of any plans for afforestation in your country. What
actions or incentives could make it more effective?
10 Assume a snow-covered area at latitude 60◦ with an albedo of ﬁfty per cent
is replaced by partially snow-covered forest with an albedo of twenty per
cent. Make an approximate comparison between the ‘cooling’ effect of the
carbon sink provided by the forest and the ‘warming’ effect of the added
solar radiation absorbed, averaged over the year.

20 Note that, although the amount of forcing from the minor gases is the same,
when turned into equivalent carbon dioxide, the amounts added increase
with the carbon dioxide concentration to which the amount is added. This is
because the relationship between radiative forcing (R in W m−2 ) and concentration (C in ppm) is non-linear. The relationship is R = 5.3 ln (C/C0 )
where C0 is the pre-industrial CO2 concentration.

Chapter 11

Energy and transport for the future

We ﬂick a switch and energy ﬂows. Energy is provided so easily for the
developed world that thought is rarely given to where it comes from,
whether it will ever run out or whether it is harming the environment.
Energy is also cheap enough that little serious attention is given to conserving it. However, most of the world’s energy comes from the burning
of fossil fuels, which generates a large proportion of the greenhouse gas
emissions into the atmosphere. If these emissions are to be reduced, a
large proportion of the reduction will have to occur in the energy sector. There is a need, therefore, to concentrate the minds of policymakers
and indeed of everyone on our energy requirements and usage. This
chapter looks at how future energy might be provided in a sustainable
manner.1 It also addresses how basic energy services might be made available to the more than two billion in the world who as yet have no such
provision.

World energy demand and supply
Most of the energy we use can be traced back to the Sun. In the case
of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) it has been stored away over millions
of years in the past. If wood (or other biomass including animal and
vegetable oils), hydro-power, wind or solar energy itself is used, the
energy has either been converted from sunlight almost immediately or
has been stored for at most a few years. These latter sources of energy
are renewable; they will be considered in more detail later in the chapter.
The only common form of energy that does not originate with the Sun is
nuclear energy; this comes from radioactive elements that were present
in the Earth when it was formed.

since 1860 in thousand millions of tonnes of oil equivalent (Gtoe) per year. In
terms of primary energy units, 1 Gtoe = 41.87 exajoules (1 exajoule (EJ)
= 1018 J). Of the ’other’ in 2000, approximately 0.9 Gtoe is attributed to
traditional fuels, 0.7 Gtoe to nuclear energy and 0.6 Gtoe to hydro and other
renewables (source: Report of G8 Renewable Energy task Force, July 2001).

Until the Industrial Revolution, energy for human society was provided from ‘traditional’ sources – wood and other biomass and animal
power. Since 1860, as industry has developed, the rate of energy use
has multiplied by about a factor of thirty (Figure 11. 1), at ﬁrst mostly
through the use of coal followed, since about 1950, by rapidly increasing
use of oil and then more recently by the use of natural gas. In 2000 the
world consumption of energy was about 10 000 million tonnes of oil
equivalent (toe). This can be converted into physical energy units to give
an average rate of energy use of about thirteen million million watts (or
13 terawatts = 13 × 1012 W).2
Great disparities exist in the amount of energy used per person in
various parts of the world. The two billion poorest people in the world
(less than $US 1000 annual income per capita) each use an average of
only 0.2 toe of energy annually while the billion richest in the world (more
than $US 22 000 annual income per capita) use nearly twenty-ﬁve times
that amount at 5 toe per capita annually.3 The average annual energy use
per capita in the world is about 1.7 toe, an average consumption of energy
of about 2.2 kilowatts (kW). The highest rates of energy consumption
are in North America where the average citizen consumes an average
of about 11 kW. Over one-third of the world’s population rely wholly
on traditional fuels (wood, dung, rice husks, other forms of ‘biofuels’)
and do not currently have access to commercial energy in any of its
forms.

Energy and transport for the future

It is interesting to see how the energy we consume is used.4 Taking the world average for commercial energy (i.e. omitting ‘traditional
energy’), about twenty-two per cent of primary energy is used in transportation, about forty-one per cent by industry, about thirty-four per
cent in buildings (two-thirds in residential buildings and one-third in
commercial buildings) and about three per cent in agriculture. It is also
perhaps interesting to know how much energy is used in the form of
electricity. Rather more than one-third of primary energy goes to make
electricity at an average efﬁciency of conversion of about one-third. Of
this electrical power about half, on average, is utilised by industry and
the other half in commercial activities and in homes.
How much is spent on energy? Taking the world as a whole, the
amount spent per year by the average person for the 1.7 toe of energy
used, is about ﬁve per cent of annual income. Despite the very large
disparity in incomes, the proportion spent on primary energy is much
the same in developed countries and developing ones.
How about energy for the future? If we continue to generate most
of our energy from coal, oil and gas, do we have enough to keep us
going? Current knowledge of proven recoverable reserves (Figure 11.2)
indicates that known reserves of fossil fuel will meet demand for the
period up to 2020 and substantially beyond. Before mid century, if demand continues to expand, oil and gas production will come under increasing pressure. Further exploration will be stimulated, which will
lead to the exploitation of more sources, although increased difﬁculty
of extraction can be expected to lead to a rise in price. So far as coal is
concerned, there are operating mines with resources for production for
well over a hundred years.
Estimates have also been made of the ultimately recoverable fossil
fuel reserves, deﬁned as those potentially recoverable assuming high but
not prohibitive prices and no signiﬁcant bans on exploitation. Although
these are bound to be somewhat speculative,5 they show that, at current
rates of use, reserves of oil and gas are likely to be available for l00
years and of coal for more than l000 years. In addition to fossil fuel
reserves considered now to be potentially recoverable there are reserves
not included in Figure 11.2, such as the methane hydrates, which are
probably very large in quantity but from which extraction would be
much more difﬁcult.
Likely reserves of uranium for nuclear power stations should also be
included in this list. When converted to the same units (assuming their
use in ‘fast’ reactors) they are believed to be at least 3000 and possibly as
high as 12 000 Gtoe, substantially greater than likely fossil fuel reserves.
For at least the twenty-ﬁrst century, sufﬁcient fossil fuels in total are
available to meet likely energy demand. It is considerations other than

Future energy projections
In Chapter 6 were described the SRES scenarios sponsored by the IPCC
that detail, for the twenty-ﬁrst century, a range of possibilities regarding
future energy demand (based on a range of assumptions concerning
population, economic growth and social and political development), how
that demand might be met and what carbon dioxide emissions might
result. In that chapter were also described the implications for those
scenarios regarding climate change. Chapter 10 presented the imperative
set out by the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) in its
Objective that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere must
be stabilised so that continued anthropogenic climate change can be

272

Energy and transport for the future

Energy intensity and carbon intensity
An index that provides an indication of a country’s
energy efﬁciency is the ratio of annual energy consumption to gross domestic product (GDP) known
as the energy intensity. Figure 11.3 shows that
from 1971 to 1996 for Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries
GDP increased by a factor of two while energy consumption increased by about ﬁfty per cent, the result
being a decrease in energy intensity of about twenty
per cent or an average of about one per cent per year.
Within the OECD there are substantial differences
between countries. Denmark, Italy and Japan have
the lowest energy intensities and Canada and the

USA the highest, with more than a factor of two
between the lowest and the highest.
Of importance too in the context of this chapter is the carbon intensity, which is a measure of
how much carbon is emitted for a given amount of
energy. This can vary with different fuels. For instance, the carbon intensity of natural gas is twentyﬁve per cent less than that of oil and forty per cent
less than that of coal. For renewable sources the carbon intensity is small and depends largely on that
which originates during manufacture of the equipment making up the renewable source (e.g. during
manufacture of solar cells).

Figure 11.3 Energy intensity averaged over OECD countries 1971–96.

avoided. Scenarios of carbon dioxide emissions that would be consistent
with various stabilisation levels were presented there and arguments put
forward for a target level for atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide
in the range of 450 to 500 ppm. How the world’s energy producers and
consumers can meet the challenge of this target is addressed by this
chapter.

Future energy projections

Figure 11.4 Scenarios of carbon dioxide emissions during the twenty-ﬁrst
century from fossil fuel burning for WEC scenarios A, B and C (details in Tables
11.1 and 11.2). It is only scenario C that leads to stabilisation of carbon dioxide
concentrations as required by the Objective of the Climate Convention.

One of the bodies that has considered how such a target can be met
is the World Energy Council (WEC), who have constructed four detailed
energy scenarios (Figure 11.4) for the period to 2020, extended with less
detail to 2100.6 Three of the scenarios (more details in box on pages
276–7) make assumptions (more details in the box below) that fall within
the range of those made by the SRES scenarios. The fourth scenario C,
which is described as ‘ecologically driven’, assumes that environmental
pressures have a large inﬂuence on energy demand and growth. For all
these scenarios, except WEC scenario C, atmospheric concentrations of
carbon dioxide continue to rise throughout the twenty-ﬁrst century. It
is WEC scenario C, if achieved, that is consistent with carbon dioxide
stabilisation with a target in the range 450–500 ppm.
Details of the scenarios to the year 2020 are shown in Figures 11.5
and 11.6. As can be seen from Figure 11.5, it is only in the developed world that there is potential for containing future energy demand.

273

Energy and transport for the future

Figure 11.5 Primary energy demand by economic groupings of countries for
WEC scenarios.

Figure 11.6 Primary energy supply mix for WEC scenarios.

Population growth and the need for economic development in developing
countries make it inevitable that they will, for many decades, consume
increased amounts of energy. For all the scenarios to 2020, fossil fuels
continue to dominate the energy mix (Figure 11.6). The contribution
from nuclear power is assumed to grow in all the cases. New renewable
energy sources play an increasing role, although apart from Case C their
contribution is small.
For the ‘ecologically driven’ WEC scenario C the energy demand
in 2020 is about thirty per cent more than that in 1990 and thirty per
cent less than that for scenario A. Scenario C assumes that there will
be large increases in efﬁciency (or a large decrease in energy intensity)
leading to a reduced energy demand and also, following the results of

a WEC study on renewable energy,7 a substantial growth in the share
of primary energy supply coming from new renewable energy sources
(‘modern’ biomass, solar, wind and so on). A growth in world energy
supply from these new renewable sources from two per cent in 1990 to
twelve per cent in 2020 (by when 1.4 Gtoe per year would be coming
from these sources) is considered feasible if their development is given
sufﬁcient support. By the year 2050 under scenario C, twenty per cent
of energy supply is assumed to come from new renewable sources and
by 2100, ﬁfty per cent. The WEC report points out that ‘cost effective
research, development and installation involving ﬁnancing which only
governments can supply will be needed if these sources of energy are
to be implemented on the large scale shown in the Ecologically Driven
Case C’. Renewable energy sources will be discussed further later in the
chapter.
During the last few years many organisations have developed mitigation energy scenarios for the twenty-ﬁrst century under a wide variety
of assumptions regarding the growth of total energy, renewable energy
and energy efﬁciency.8 As one example of these, Figure 11.7 shows a
scenario developed by the Shell Oil Company which is called ‘Dynamics

as Usual’. The ﬁgure illustrates the large transitions that have occurred
in energy sources in the past and those that will have to take place in the
future.
The following sections address how increased energy conservation
and efﬁciency can be achieved and what developments can be realised in
new renewable energy sources; these are the technical means through
which the necessary reductions in carbon dioxide emissions will be
achieved in the energy sector.

World Energy Council scenarios
The World Energy Council (WEC) is an international non-governmental
organisation with representation from all parts of the energy industry and
from over ninety countries. The Council has developed four energy scenarios for the period to 2020, each representing different assumptions in
terms of economic development, energy efﬁciencies, technology transfer
and the ﬁnancing of development round the world. The WEC emphasises
that they have been developed to illustrate future possibilities and they
should not be considered as predictions.
All four cases assume that there will be signiﬁcant environmental and
economic pressures to achieve major improvements in energy efﬁciency
compared to historic performance, although to different degrees within
the various economic groupings of countries. One of them, scenario
C, assumes very strong pressure to reduce the emissions of greenhouse
gases in order to combat global warming. Table 11.1 presents the detailed
assumptions underlying the four scenarios.
Table 11.1 refers to the ‘energy intensity’ (see box on page 272),
which is a measure of energy efﬁciency. When averaged over the world,
over the past ﬁfty years it has been falling by about one per cent per year. A
more demanding rate of reduction in energy intensity than this is assumed
for all the scenarios; for case C, the ecologically driven scenario, the rate
assumed is considered very demanding indeed. The main difference
between the modiﬁed reference case B1 and the reference case B is that,
in B1, the rate of reduction of energy intensity assumed for the economies
in transition is less than in case B and for the developing countries is
only half that in case B.
With somewhat less detail, scenarios A, B and C have been extended
to the year 2100 (Figure 11.4). Global energy demand can be expected to
continue to increase, but by that time the availability of fossil fuels will
be more limited and new renewables will contribute substantially to the
energy mix for all scenarios. Some of the characteristics of the scenarios
out to 2100 are listed in Table 11.2 – similar details of the scenarios for
2020 are in Figure 11.6.

Energy and transport for the future

Energy conservation and efﬁciency in buildings
If we turn lights off in our homes when we do not need them, if we turn
down the thermostat by a degree or two so that we are less warm or if
we add more insulation to our home, we are conserving or indeed saving
energy. But are such actions signiﬁcant in overall energy terms? Is it
realistic to plan for really worthwhile savings in our use of energy?
To illustrate what might be possible, let us consider the efﬁciency
with which energy is currently used. The energy available in the coal,
oil, gas, uranium, hydraulic or wind power is primary energy. It is either
used directly, for instance as heat, or it is transformed into motor power
or electricity that in turn provides for many uses. The process of energy
conversion, transmission and transformation into its ﬁnal useful form
involves a proportion of the primary energy being wasted. For example,
to provide one unit of electrical power at the point of use typically requires
about three units of primary energy. An incandescent light bulb is about
three per cent efﬁcient in converting primary energy into light energy;

Thermodynamic efﬁciencies
When considering the efﬁciency of energy use, it can be important to
distinguish between efﬁciency as deﬁned by the First Law of Thermodynamics and efﬁciency as deﬁned by the Second Law. The second
particularly applies when energy is used for heating.
A furnace used to heat a building may deliver to heating the building
say eighty per cent of the energy released by full combustion of the fuel,
the rest being lost through the pipes, ﬂue, etc. That eighty per cent is
a First Law efﬁciency. An ideal thermodynamic device delivering 100
units of energy as heat to the inside of a building at a temperature of
20 ◦ C from the outside at a temperature of 0 ◦ C would only require just
under seven units of energy. So the Second Law efﬁciency of the furnace
is less than six per cent.
Heat pumps (refrigerators or air conditioners working in reverse)
are devices that make use of the Second Law and deliver more energy
as heat than the electrical energy they use.12 Although typically their
Second Law efﬁciencies are only about thirty per cent, they are still able
to deliver more heat energy than the primary energy required to generate
the electricity they use. Because of their comparatively high capital and
maintenance costs, however, heat pumps have not been widely used. An
example of their substantial use is their contribution to district heating
in the city of Uppsala in Sweden where 4 MW of electricity is employed
to extract heat from the river and deliver 14 MW of heat energy.

Energy conservation and efﬁciency in buildings

unnecessary use of lighting reduces the overall efﬁciency to perhaps
no more than one per cent.9 Assessments have been carried out across
all energy uses comparing actual energy use with that which would be
consumed by ideal devices providing the same services. Although there
is some difﬁculty in deﬁning precisely the performance of such ‘ideal’
devices (see box below for a discussion of thermodynamic efﬁciencies),
assessments of this kind come up with world average end-use energy
efﬁciencies of the order of three per cent. That sort of ﬁgure suggests
that there is a large amount of room for improvement in energy efﬁciency,
perhaps by at least threefold.10 In this section we look at the possibilities
for energy saving in buildings; in later sections we shall consider possible
savings in transport and in industry.11
To be comfortable in buildings we heat them in winter and cool them
in summer. In the United States, for instance, about thirty-six per cent

Efﬁciency of appliances
There is large potential for reducing the electricity consumption from
appliances used in domestic or commercial buildings. If, in replacing
appliances, everyone bought the most efﬁcient available, their total electricity consumption could easily drop by more than half.
Take lighting for instance. One-ﬁfth of all electricity used in the USA
goes directly into lighting. This can easily be reduced by the wider use of
compact ﬂuorescent light bulbs that are as bright as ordinary light bulbs,
but use a quarter of the electricity and last eight times as long before
they have to be replaced – with signiﬁcant economic savings to the user.
For instance, a 20-W compact ﬂuorescent bulb (equivalent to a 100-W
ordinary incandescent light bulb) costing £5 or less will use about £20
worth of electricity over its lifetime of twelve years. To cover the same
period eight ordinary bulbs would be needed costing about £4 but using
£100 worth of electricity. The net saving is therefore about £80. A further
large increase in the efﬁciency of lighting will occur when light emitting
diodes (LEDs) giving out white light become commonplace.14 The latest
such device that is about one square centimetre in size and consuming
only 3-W, produces the same light as a 60-W incandescent bulb.
The average daily electricity use from the appliances in a home
(cooker, washing machine, dishwasher, refrigerator, freezer, TVs, lighting) for typical appliances bought in the early 1990s amounts to about
10 kWh per day. If these were replaced by the most efﬁcient available
now, electricity use would fall by about two-thirds. The extra cost of
the purchase of efﬁcient appliances would soon be recovered in the savings in running cost. Similar calculations can be carried out for other
appliances.

279

Insulation of buildings
About one and a half thousand million people live in cold climates where some heating in
buildings is required. In most countries the energy demand of space heating in buildings is far
greater than it need be if the buildings were better insulated.
Table 11.3 provides as an example details of two houses, showing that the provision of
insulation in the roof, the walls and the windows can easily lead to the energy requirement for
space heating being more than halved (from 5.8 kW to 2.65 kW). The cost of the insulation is
small and is quickly recovered through the lower energy cost.
If a system for circulating air through the house is also installed, the number of necessary
air changes with outside air is less and the total heating requirement further reduced. In this
case it is worthwhile to add more insulation to reduce the heating requirement still further.

Energy conservation and efﬁciency in buildings

of the total use of energy is in buildings (about two-thirds of this in
electricity), including about twenty per cent for their heating (including
water heating) and about three per cent for cooling.13 Energy demand
in the buildings sector grew by about three per cent per year averaged
worldwide from 1970 to 1990 and, apart from countries with economies
in transition, has been growing during the last decade by about 2.5% per
year. How can these trends be reversed?
Substantial energy savings can be made in buildings by improving
their insulation (see box above) and by improving the efﬁciency of appliances (see box on page 279). Many countries, including the UK and the
USA, still have relatively poor standards of building insulation compared,
for instance, with Scandanavian countries. Improvements in building design to make better use of energy from sunlight can also help (see box
on page 301). There are also large possibilities for the improvement of
the efﬁciency of appliances at relatively small cost.
The results of a study in the USA have identiﬁed some of the large
savings that could be made in the electricity used in buildings. The
cost of such action would be less than the cost of the energy savings;
overall therefore there would be a substantial net saving (Figure 11.8).
The twelve options in Figure 11.8 together cover about forty-ﬁve per
cent of the amount of electricity used in residential buildings in the
USA, which in 1990 was about 1700 TWh or about ten per cent of
the USA’s total energy use. The four options that provide the largest
savings (together adding up to sixty per cent of the savings) are in the
areas of commercial lighting, commercial air conditioning, residential
appliances and residential space heating. Electricity companies in
some parts of the USA are contracting to implement some of these
energy-saving measures as an alternative to the installation of new
capacity – at signiﬁcant proﬁt both to the companies and its customers.
Similar savings would be possible in other developed countries. Major
savings at least as large in percentage terms could also be made in
countries with economies in transition and in developing countries if
existing plant and equipment were used more efﬁciently.
Further large savings can be realised when buildings are being
planned and designed by the employment of integrated building design.
When buildings are designed, the designs of the systems for heating, air
conditioning and ventilation are commonly carried out separately from
the main design. The value of integrated building design is that energysaving opportunities can be taken up associated with the synergies between many aspects of the overall design and the design (including the
sizing) of the systems where much of the energy use occurs. Many examples exist of low energy buildings, where integrated building design
has been employed, that consume less than half the energy and are often

per cent of the electricity use.

more acceptable and user-friendly than those that have been designed in
more traditional ways.15 Some recent examples demonstrate the possibility of more radical building designs that aim at Zero Emission (fossilfuel) Developments (ZED). The box illustrates a recent development in
the UK along these lines.
Recent studies17 suggest that with aggressive implementation of
energy-efﬁcient policies and measures, carbon dioxide emissions from
buildings in both developed and developing countries could be reduced
by about twenty-ﬁve per cent in 2010 and about ﬁfty per cent in 2050. If
however growth in energy demand in the buildings sector continues to
increase at the current rate, these savings in emissions due to increased efﬁciency will mostly go to compensate for the growth in demand. Further
increases in efﬁciency, however, could be achieved by new technologies that are in prospect such as the use of LEDs for lighting (see box
above on appliances). What is clearly necessary also is a switch to nonfossil-fuel energy sources to which we shall be turning in later sections.

Energy savings in transport

Example of a ZED (Zero Emission (fossil-fuel)
Development)
BedZED is a mixed development urban village constructed on a brownﬁeld wasteland in the London Borough of Sutton, providing eighty-two
dwellings in a mixture of apartments, maisonettes and town houses together with some work/ofﬁce space and community facilities.16 The
combination of super-insulation, a wind-driven ventilation system incorporating heat recovery and passive solar gain stored within each unit
in thermally massive ﬂoors and walls reduces the energy needs so that a
135-kW wood-fuelled combined heat and power (CHP) plant is sufﬁcient
to meet the village’s energy requirements. A 109-kW peak photovoltaic
installation provides enough solar electricity to power forty electric cars,
some pool, some taxi, some privately owned. The community has the
capacity to lead a carbon neutral lifestyle – with all energy for buildings
and local transport being supplied from renewable sources.

Energy savings in transport
Transport is responsible for nearly one-quarter of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. It is also the sector where emissions are growing
most rapidly. Road transport accounts for the largest proportion of this,
over eighty per cent in industrialised countries; air transport is next at
thirteen per cent. Since 1970, the number of motor vehicles in the United
States has grown at an average rate of 2.5% per year, in the rest of the
world the growth has been almost twice as rapid at nearly ﬁve per cent
per year (Figure 11.9). The latter trend will continue or increase as there
remain very large differences in the degree of car ownership between
different countries – for instance about 1.5 persons per car in the USA
and a little over 100 persons per car in India and China. The advantages
conferred by the motor car, the convenience, freedom and ﬂexibility that
it brings, mean that growth in its use is bound to continue. Increased prosperity also brings with it increased movement of freight. In the transport
sector the achievement of reductions in carbon dioxide emissions will
be particularly challenging.
There are three types of action that can be taken to curb the energy use
of motor transport.18 The ﬁrst is to increase the efﬁciency of fuel use. We
cannot expect the average car to compete with the vehicle which, in 1992,
set a record by covering over 12 000 km on one gallon of petrol – a journey
which serves to illustrate how inefﬁciently we use energy for transport!
However, it is estimated that the average fuel consumption of the current
ﬂeet of motor cars could be halved through the use of existing technology

283

284

Energy and transport for the future

motor vehicle population,

(see box below) – more efﬁcient engines, lightweight construction and
low-air-resistance design – while maintaining an adequate performance.
The second action is to plan cities and other developments so as to
lessen the need for transport and to make personalised transport less
necessary – work, leisure and shopping should all be easily accessible
by public transport, or by walking or cycling. Such planning needs also
to be linked with a recognition of the importance of ensuring that public
transport is reliable, convenient, affordable and safe. The third action is to
increase the energy efﬁciency of freight transport by making maximum
use of the most energy-efﬁcient forms of freight transport, e.g. rail or
water rather than road or air and by eliminating unnecessary journeys.
Air transport is growing even faster than motor transport. Global
passenger air travel, as measured in passenger-km, is projected to grow at
about ﬁve per cent per year over the next decade or more and total aviation
fuel use – including passenger, freight and military – is projected to
increase by about three per cent per year, the difference being due largely
to increased fuel efﬁciency.19 Further increases in fuel efﬁciency are
expected but they are unlikely to keep up with the increase in the volume
of air transport. A further problem with air transport, as mentioned in
Chapter 3 page 52, is that its carbon dioxide emissions are not the only
contributor to global warming; increased high cloudiness due to other
emissions produce an effect of similar or even greater magnitude. Further
research directed at understanding the climatic effects of aircraft and how
they may be reduced is urgently required.

Energy savings in industry
Substantial opportunities exist for efﬁciency savings in industry. The
installation of relatively simple control technology often provides large

Energy savings in industry

Technologies for reducing carbon dioxide emissions
from motor cars20
An important recent development is that of the hybrid electric motor car
that combines an internal combustion engine with an electric drive train
and battery. The gains in efﬁciency and therefore fuel economy achieved
by hybrid vehicles are typically around ﬁfty per cent. They mainly arise
from: (1) use of regenerative braking (with the motor used as a generator
and captured electricity stored in the battery), (2) running on the battery and electric traction only when in slow moving or congested trafﬁc,
(3) avoiding low efﬁciency modes of the internal combustion engine and
(4) downsizing the internal combustion engine through the use of the
motor/battery as a power booster. Both Toyota and Honda have introduced commercially available hybrid models and other manufacturers
are not far behind.
Other signiﬁcant efﬁciency improvements have come from the use
of lower weight structural materials, improvements in low-air-resistance
design and the availability of direct injection diesel engines, long used
in heavy trucks, for automobiles and light trucks.
Biofuels generated from crops can be employed to fuel motor vehicles thereby avoiding fossil fuel use. For instance, ethanol has been
extensively produced from sugarcane in Brazil and from maize in the
USA. Biodiesel is also becoming more widely available. However, such
fuels can as yet only compete with fossil fuels if they are strongly subsidised.
During the next few years we will begin to see the introduction of
vehicles driven by fuel cells (see Figure 11.15) based on hydrogen fuel
that can potentially be produced from renewable sources (see page 310).
This new technology has the potential to have a large inﬂuence on the
transport sector.

potential for energy reduction at a substantial net saving in cost. The
co-generation of heat and power, which already enables electricity generators to make better use of heat which would otherwise be wasted, is
particularly applicable to some industrial plants where large amounts
of both heat and power can be required. To take an example: British
Sugar in 1992 with an annual turnover of £700 million spent £21 million
p.a. on energy. Through low-grade heat recovery, co-generation schemes
and better control of heating and lighting, in 1992 the spend on energy
per tonne of sugar had been reduced by forty-one per cent from that in
1980.21 Other potential decreases in carbon dioxide emissions can occur
through the recycling of materials, the use of waste as an energy source

and through switching to less carbon intensive fuels. Many studies in
industrialised countries indicate that savings of thirty per cent or more
could be made in the industrial sector at a net saving in overall economic
terms.22
Given appropriate incentives, substantial savings of carbon dioxide
emissions can also be realised in the petrochemical industry that can
result in signiﬁcant savings in cost. For instance, British Petroleum has
set up a carbon emissions trading system within the company that encourages the elimination of waste and leaks from their operations and
the application of technology to eliminate the venting of methane. In
its ﬁrst three years of operation, 600 million US dollars were saved and
carbon emissions reduced to ten per cent below 1990 levels.23
There is also room for increased efﬁciency in large power stations
or other installations burning fossil fuels. The efﬁciency of coal-ﬁred
power stations, for instance, has improved from about thirty-two per
cent, a typical value of twenty years ago, to about forty-two per cent
for a pressurised, ﬂuidised bed combustion plant of today. Gas turbine
technology has also improved providing efﬁciency improvements such
that efﬁciencies approaching sixty per cent are reached by large modern
gas-turbine-combined cycle plants. Such improvements are very significant in environmental terms and it is important that means be provided
for the latest, most efﬁcient technology to be available and attractive
to rapidly industrialising countries such as China and India. Substantial further gains in overall efﬁciency can be realised by making sure
that the large quantities of low-grade heat generated by power stations
is not wasted but utilised, for instance in combined heat and power
(CHP) schemes. For such co-generation, the efﬁciencies attainable in
the use of the energy from combustion of the fuel are typically around
eighty per cent.
Table 11.4 provides summary estimates of the contributions different sectors or industries could make to greenhouse gas reductions by
2010 and 2020 respectively. In total they amount to about half of the
emissions from these industries or sectors in 1990. Many of the contributions summarised in the table and most of the proposals described in
this section fall into the category of ‘no regrets’ proposals – mentioned in
Chapter 9. In other words, not only do they lead to substantial reductions
in greenhouse gas emissions but they are good to do for other reasons –
they lead to increased efﬁciency, cost savings or improvements in performance or comfort. It remains the case, however, that basic energy
is generally so cheap, that without both encouragement and incentives,
progress with the implementation of many of the proposals will be limited. Some of the policy instruments mentioned later can address this
issue.

Capture and storage of carbon dioxide

Capture and storage of carbon dioxide
An alternative to moving away from fossil fuel sources of energy is to
prevent the carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning from entering the
atmosphere. This can be done either by removing it from the ﬂue gases
in a power station, or the fossil fuel feedstock could, in a gasiﬁcation
plant, be converted through the use of steam,24 to carbon dioxide and
hydrogen. The carbon dioxide is then relatively easy to remove and the
hydrogen can be used as a versatile fuel. The latter option will become
more attractive when the technical and logistic problems of the largescale use of hydrogen in fuel cells to generate electricity have been
overcome – we mention this again later in the chapter.
Various options are possible for the disposal (or sequestration) of
the very large amounts of carbon dioxide which result. For instance,
the carbon dioxide can be pumped into spent oil or gas wells, into deep
saline reservoirs or into unminable coal seams.25 Other suggestions have
also been made such as pumping it into the deep ocean, but these are
more speculative and need careful research and assessment before they
can be realistically put forward. In the most favourable circumstances
(for instance when power stations are close to oil or gas ﬁelds and when
the extraction cost is relatively small), the cost of removal, although
signiﬁcant, is only a small fraction of the total energy cost. For instance,
in Norway where there is carbon tax of $US l5 per tonne of carbon, a
company is ﬁnding it economic to pump over one million tonnes per year
of carbon dioxide removed from a natural gas stream into storage under
the North Sea. In other circumstances estimates of the cost are larger
(perhaps up to 100% on top of the energy cost) – the cost of extraction
being generally larger than the cost of storage.
The technology of carbon capture and storage could enable continuing use of fossil fuels without the deleterious effects of carbon dioxide
emissions. The global potential for underground carbon dioxide storage
is large. For instance, it has been estimated that over 200 Gt of carbon
as carbon dioxide could be stored in geological reservoirs in north west
Europe alone. How much it is used will depend more on the cost than
on the availability of suitable storage sites.

Renewable energy
To put our energy use in context it is interesting to realise that the energy
incident on the Earth from the Sun amounts to about 180 thousand million
million watts (or 180 000 terawatts, 1 TW = 1012 W). This is about
14 000 times the world’s average energy use of about 13 million million
watts (13 TW). As much energy arrives at the Earth from the Sun in

289

290

Energy and transport for the future

forty minutes as we use in a whole year. So, providing we can harness
it satisfactorily and economically, there is plenty of renewable energy
coming in from the Sun to provide for all the demands human society
can conceivably make.
There are many ways in which solar energy is converted into forms
that we can use; it is interesting to look at the efﬁciencies of these conversions. If the solar energy is concentrated, by mirrors for instance,
almost all of it can be made available as heat energy. Between one and
two per cent of solar energy is converted through atmospheric circulation into wind energy, which although concentrated in windy places is
still distributed through the whole atmosphere. About twenty per cent of
solar energy is used in evaporating water from the Earth’s surface which
eventually falls as precipitation, giving the possibility of hydropower.
Living material turns sunlight into energy through photosynthesis with
an efﬁciency of around one per cent for the best crops. Finally, photovoltaic (PV) cells convert sunlight into electricity with an efﬁciency that
for the best modern cells can be over twenty per cent.
Around the year 1900, very early in the production of commercial electricity, water power was an obvious source and from the beginning made an important contribution. Hydroelectric schemes now supply
about six per cent of the world’s commercial energy. Other renewable
sources of commercial energy, however, have been dependent on recent
technology for their implementation. In 1990, only about two per cent of
the world’s commercial energy came from renewable sources other than
large hydro26 (these are often collectively known as ‘new renewables’).
Of this two per cent (Table 11.5), about three-quarters was from ‘modern’ biomass (called ‘modern’ when it contributes to commercial energy
to distinguish it from traditional biomass), the other 0.5% being shared
between solar, wind energy, geothermal and small hydro sources.
Returning to commercial energy generation, in order to put renewable sources into context, it is useful to inspect the detailed projection of
the WEC (Table 11.5) for the contributions from different ‘new renewable’ sources which make up the twelve per cent of total energy supply
in the year 2020 assumed for the WEC scenario C. The main growth
expected is in energy from ‘modern’ biomass and from solar and wind
energy sources. Table 11.6 provides detailed summary information about
the status and cost of different renewable energy sources.
In the following paragraphs, the main renewable sources are described in turn and their possibilities for growth considered.27 Most of
them are employed for the production of electricity through mechanical
means (for hydro and wind power), through heat engines (for biomass and
solar thermal) and through direct conversion from sunlight (solar PV).
In the case of biomass, liquid or gaseous fuels can also be produced.

Hydro-power
Hydro-power, the oldest form of renewable energy, is well established and
is competitive economically with electricity generated by other means.
Some hydroelectric schemes are extremely large. The world’s largest, the
Three Gorges project on the Yangtze river in China, when completed will
generate about 20 000 MW of electricity. Two other large schemes, each
of over 10 000 MW capacity, are in South America at Guri in Venezuela
and at Itaipu on the borders of Brazil and Paraguay. It is estimated28
that there is potential for further exploitation of hydroelectric capacity
to three or four times the amount that has currently been developed,
much of this undeveloped potential being in the former Soviet Union and
in developing countries. Large schemes, however, can have signiﬁcant
social impact (such as the movement of population from the reservoir
site), environmental consequences (for example, loss of land, of species
and of sedimentation to the lower reaches of the river), and problems
of their own such as silting up, which have to be thoroughly addressed
before they can be undertaken.

Biomass as fuel

But hydroelectric schemes do not have to be large; Table 11.5 distinguishes between large and small hydroelectric sources. Many units
exist generating a few kilowatts only that may supply one farm or a
small village. The attractiveness of small schemes is that they provide a
locally based supply at modest cost. Substantial growth in ‘small hydro’
has occurred during the last decade or so, from around 20 000 MW in
1990 to about 40 000 MW in 2000.29 Installations in China account for
about half of this latter ﬁgure where the growth has been about twice
as rapid as in the rest of the world. Many more possibilities still exist
for the exploitation of the potential of small rivers and streams in many
parts of the world.
An important facility provided by some hydro schemes is that of
pumped storage. Using surplus electricity available in off-peak hours,
water can be pumped from a lower reservoir to a higher one. Then, at
other times, by reversing the process, electricity can be generated to
meet periods of peak demand. The efﬁciency of conversion can be as
high as eighty per cent and the response time a few seconds, so reducing
the need to keep other generating capacity in reserve. In 1990 about
75 000 MW of pumped storage capacity was available worldwide with
a further 25 000 MW under construction.30

Biomass as fuel31
Second in current importance as a renewable energy source is the use
of biomass as a fuel. The annual global primary production of biomass
of all kinds expressed in energy units is about 4500 EJ (= 107 Gtoe).
About one per cent of this is currently turned into energy mostly in developing countries – we have labelled it ‘traditional biomass’. It has been
estimated that about six per cent of the total could become available for
energy crops taking into account the economics of production and the
availability of suitable land.32 The energy so generated would represent
about seventy-ﬁve per cent of current world energy consumption – a substantial contribution to global energy needs. It is a genuinely renewable
resource in that the carbon dioxide which is emitted when the biomass
is burnt is turned back into carbon, through the process of photosynthesis, in the renewed biomass when it is grown again. The word biomass
not only covers crops of all kinds but also domestic, industrial and agricultural dry waste material and wet waste material, all of which can be
used as fuel for heating and to power electricity generators; some are
also appropriate to use for the manufacture of liquid or gaseous fuels.
Since biomass is widely distributed, it is particularly appropriate as a
distributed energy source suitable for rural areas.

293

294

Energy and transport for the future

In much of the developing world, most of the population live in
areas where there is no access to modern or on-grid energy. They rely
on ‘traditional biomass’ (fuelwood, dung, rice husks and other forms of
biofuels) to satisfy their needs for cooking and heating. Ten per cent or
so of world energy originates from these sources supplying over onethird of the world’s population. Although these sources are renewable, it
is still important that they are employed efﬁciently, and a great deal of
room for increased efﬁciency exists. For instance, a large proportion of
each day is often spent in collecting ﬁrewood especially by the women,
increasingly far aﬁeld from their homes.
The burning of biomass in homes causes serious health problems
and has been identiﬁed by the World Health Organization as one of
the most serious causes of illness and mortality especially amongst
children.33 For instance, much cooking is still carried out on open ﬁres
with their associated indoor pollution and where only about ﬁve per
cent of the heat reaches the inside of the cooking pot. The introduction of a simple stove can increase this to twenty per cent or with a
little elaboration to ﬁfty per cent.34 An urgent need exists for the largescale provision of stoves using simple technology that is sustainable –
although there is often considerable consumer resistance to their introduction. Other means of reducing fuelwood demand are to encourage
alternatives such as the use of fuel from crop wastes, of methane from
sewage or other waste material or of solar cookers (mentioned again
later on). From the existing consumption of ‘traditional biomass’ there
is the potential to produce sustainable ‘modern’ energy services with
much greater efﬁciency and much less pollution for the two billion or
so people who currently rely on this basic energy source. A particular
challenge is to set up appropriate management and infrastructure for the
provision of these services in rural areas in developing countries (see box
below).
Firstly, consider the use of waste.37 There is considerable public
awareness of the vast amount of waste produced in modern society. The
UK, for example, produces each year somewhat over thirty million tonnes
of domestic solid waste, or about half a tonne for every citizen; this is
a typical value for a country in the developed world. Even with major
programmes for recycling some of it, large quantities would still remain.
If it were all incinerated for power generation (modern technology enables this to be done with negligible air pollution) about 1.7 GW could
be generated, about ﬁve per cent of the UK’s electricity requirement.38
Uppsala in Sweden is an example of a city with a comprehensive district heating system, for which, before 1980, over ninety per cent of the
energy was provided from oil. A decision was then made to move to
renewable energy and by 1993 energy from waste incineration and from

Biomass projects in rural areas in the developing world
In much of the developing world, most of the population live in areas where there is little or no access
to electricity or modern energy services. There is
large potential for creating local biomass projects
to provide such services. The use of sugar cane as
biomass provides one example of what is beginning
to be provided; three other examples are given of
pilot projects in different countries,35 all of which
could be replicated many times.

Sugar cane as biomass
A sugar cane factory produces many different
byproducts that can be efﬁciently employed as
sources of energy – either for biofuels or for electricity production.
Sugar cane production yields two kinds of
biomass fuel suitable for gasiﬁcation (Figure
11.10), known as bagasse and barbojo. Bagasse is
the residue from crushing the cane and is thus available during the milling season; barbojo consists of
the tops and leaves of the cane plant, which could be
stored for use after the milling season. It has been estimated that, using these sugar cane sources, within
thirty years or so, the eighty sugar-cane-producing
countries in the developing world could generate
two-thirds of their current electricity needs at a price
competitive with fossil fuel energy sources.36

Rural power production, India
Decentralised Energy Systems India Private Limited are piloting the ﬁrst independent power projects
of around 100 kW capacity in rural India owned and
operated by village community co-operatives. An
example is a small co-operative in Baharwari, Bihar State, where a biomass gasiﬁcation power plant
is used as a source of electricity for local enterprises, for instance for pumping water in the dry season. Local income is thereby generated that enables
villagers to expand their micro-industries and

create more jobs – all of which in turn increases the
ability of people to pay for improved energy services. A ‘mutuality of interest’ is created between
biomass fuel suppliers, electricity users and plant
operators.

Integrated biogas systems, Yunnan, China
The South-North Institute for Sustainable Development has introduced a novel integrated biogas
system in the Baima Snow Mountains Nature Reserve, Yunnan Province. The system links a biogas
digester, pigsty, toilet and greenhouse. The biogas
generated is used for cooking and replaces the burning of natural ﬁrewood, the ‘greenhouse’ pigsty increases the efﬁciency of pig-raising, the toilet improves rural environmental hygiene, and vegetables
and fruits planted in the greenhouse increase the income of local inhabitants. Manure and other organic
waste from the pigsty and toilet are used as the raw
material for biogas generation that delivers about
10 kWh per day of useful energy. The operation of
ﬁfty such systems has considerably reduced local
ﬁrewood consumption.

Biomass power generation and coconut
oil pressing, the Philippines
The Community Power Corporation (CPC) has
developed a modular biopower unit that can run
on waste residue or biomass crops and can enable village-level production of coconut oil. CPC
and local partners are using the modular biopower
unit fuelled by the waste coconut shells to provide electricity to a low-cost mini-coconut-oil-mill
(developed by the Philippines Coconut Authority
and the University of Philippines), sixteen of which
are now operating in various Philippine villages.
Furthermore, the biopower unit generates waste
heat which is essential to drying the coconuts prior
to pressing.

other biomass fuel sources provided nearly eighty per cent of what is
required for the city’s heating.
But what about the greenhouse gas generation from waste incineration? Carbon dioxide is of course produced from it, which contributes
to the greenhouse effect. However, the alternative method of disposal is
landﬁll (most of the waste in the UK currently is disposed of that way).
Decay of the waste over time produces carbon dioxide and methane in
roughly equal quantities. Some of the methane can be collected and
used as a fuel for power generation. However, only a fraction of it can
be captured; the rest leaks away. Because methane is a much more effective greenhouse gas, molecule for molecule, than carbon dioxide,
the leaked methane makes a substantial contribution to the greenhouse
effect. Detailed calculations show that if all UK domestic waste were
incinerated for power generation rather than landﬁlled, the net saving
per year in greenhouse gas emissions would be equivalent to about ten
million tonnes of carbon as carbon dioxide.39 Since this is about ﬁve
per cent of the total UK greenhouse gas emissions, we can infer that
power generation from waste could be a signiﬁcant contribution to the
reduction in overall emissions.
Other wastes resulting from human or agricultural activity are wet
wastes such as sewage sludge and farm slurries and manures. Bacterial

Wind energy

fermentation in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic digestion) of these
wastes produces biogas, which is mostly methane and which can be used
as a fuel to produce energy. There is room for an increasing contribution
from these sources. If the potential for power generation from agricultural
and industrial waste was taken into account, the savings in emissions
arising from domestic waste already mentioned could be approximately
doubled.
Turning now to the use of crops as a fuel, the potential is large.
Many different crops can be employed as biomass for energy production.
In Brazil, for instance, since the 1970s large plantations of sugar cane
have produced alcohol for use as a fuel mainly in transport, generating,
incidentally, much less local pollution than petrol or diesel fuel from
fossil sources. A lot of potential has been recognised for the sugar cane
industry to produce both sugar and energy together with other byproducts
as well (see box above). Biomass from wood plantations on agricultural
land no longer needed for food crops features as an important future
source in Sweden’s energy plans40 ; the most efﬁcient use of the biomass
is ﬁrst to turn it into biogas and then burn it in a gas turbine to produce
electricity. For the UK, trials indicate that the most promising option is
willow and poplar grown in coppices.41
Because of the low efﬁciency of conversion of solar energy to
biomass, the amount of land required for signiﬁcant energy production
by this means is large – and it is important that land is not taken over
that is required for food production. However, there is in principle no
shortage of land for this purpose. Plenty of suitable crops are available
which could be grown on land only marginally useful for agriculture. In
many developing countries biomass plantations can provide suitable fuel
for local electricity generation more competitively than other means of
generation.
The growth of the use of biomass for energy in industrialised countries (Table 11.6) is substantial but is limited by the cost differential that
exists between energy from biomass and that generated from fossil fuels
(Table 11.6). This problem is addressed later in the chapter.

Wind energy
Energy from the wind is not new. Two hundred years ago windmills were
a common feature of the European landscape; for example, in 1800 there
were over 10 000 working windmills in Britain. During the past few years
they have again become familiar on the skyline especially in countries
in western Europe (for instance, Denmark, Great Britain and Spain) and
in western North America. Slim, tall, sleek objects silhouetted against
the sky, they do not have the rustic elegance of the old windmills, but
they are much more efﬁcient. A typical wind energy generator will have

297

298

Energy and transport for the future

a two- or three-bladed propeller about 50 m in diameter and a rate of
power generation in a wind speed of 12 ms−1 (43 kmh−1 , 27 mph or
Beaufort Force 6), of about 700 kW. On a site with an average wind
speed of about 7.5 ms−1 (an average value for exposed places in many
western regions of Europe) it will generate an average power of about
250 kW. The generators are often sited close to each other in wind farms
that may include several dozen such devices.
From the point of view of the electricity generating companies the
difﬁculty with the generation of electrical power from wind is that it
is intermittent. There are substantial periods with no generation at all.
The generating companies can cope with this in the context of a national
electricity grid that pools electrical power from different sources providing that the proportion from intermittent sources is not too large.42
Some public concern about wind farms arises because of loss of visual
amenity. The use of more off-shore sites may therefore be more generally
acceptable than too much concentration in windy sites on-shore.
Rapid growth has occurred in many countries in the installation of
wind generators over the past decade – a growth that continues unabated.
But most of the growth has been for electricity generation. Over 30 GW
peak operating capacity has now (2002) been built worldwide. With
this large growth, economies of scale have brought down the cost of
the electricity generated so that it is approaching the cost of electricity
generated from fossil fuels (Table 11.6). Because the power generated
from the wind depends on the cube of the wind speed (a wind speed
of 12.5 ms−1 is twice as effective as one of 10 ms−1 ) it makes sense to
build wind farms on the windiest sites available. Some of the windiest
sites available are to be found in western Europe where some of the most
rapid growth in wind generation has occurred. In Denmark for instance,
twenty per cent of electricity is now generated by wind – increasingly
being built offshore.43 Eventually, it is envisaged the proportion could
rise to forty to ﬁfty per cent. Similar estimates of the eventual resource
are being made for the UK where rapid expansion, again especially of
off-shore wind energy generation, is envisaged.44 Developing countries
are also making increased use of wind energy. For instance, it has been
estimated that India could be generating up to 10 GW of electrical power
(about a quarter of current needs) from wind by 2030.45 With the growth
that is occurring, the proportion of global energy needs supplied from
wind energy could be substantially greater than that envisaged by the
projection in Table 11.5.
Wind energy is also particularly suitable for the generation of electricity at isolated sites to which the transmission costs of electricity from
other sources would be unacceptable. Because of the wind’s intermittency, some storage of electricity or some back-up means of generation

Energy from the Sun

Wind power on Fair Isle
A good example46 of a site where wind power has been put to good effect is Fair Isle, an isolated island in the North Sea north of the Scottish
mainland. Until recently, the population of seventy depended on coal
and oil for heat, petrol for vehicles and diesel for electricity generation.
A 50-kW wind generator was installed in 1982 to generate electricity
from the persistent strong winds of average speed over 8 ms−1 (29 kmh−1
or 18 mph). The electricity is available for a wide variety of purposes;
at a relatively high price for lighting and electronic devices and at a
lower price controlled amounts are available (wind permitting) for comfort heat and water heating. At the frequent periods of excessive wind
further heat is available for heating glasshouses and a small swimming
pool. Electronic control coupled with rapid switching enables loads to
be matched to the available supply. An electric vehicle has been charged
from the system to illustrate a further use for the energy.
With the installation of the wind generator, which now supplies over
ninety per cent of the island’s electricity, electricity consumption has
risen about fourfold and the average electricity costs have fallen from
13 pkWh−1 to 4 pkWh−1 . A second wind turbine of 100 kW capacity
was installed in 1996/7 to meet increasing demand and to improve wind
capture.

has to be provided as well. The installation on Fair Isle (see box) is a
good example of an efﬁcient and versatile system. Small wind turbines
also provide an ideal means for charging batteries in isolated locations;
for instance, about 100 000 are in use by Mongolian herdsmen. Wind
energy is often also an ideal source for water pumps – one million small
wind turbines are used for this purpose worldwide.47
In the longer term it can be envisaged that wind generation could
expand into areas remote from direct electrical connection providing an
effective means for energy storage (for instance, using hydrogen; more
of that possibility later in the chapter) is developed.

Energy from the Sun
The simplest way of making use of energy from the Sun is to turn it into
heat. A black surface directly facing full sunlight can absorb about 1 kW
for each square metre of surface. In countries with a high incidence of
sunshine it is an effective and cheap means of providing domestic hot
water, which is extensively employed in countries such as Australia,
Israel, Japan and the southern states of the USA (see box above).

Solar water heating
The essential components of a solar water heater (Figure 11.11) are a set
of tubes in which the water ﬂows embedded in a black plate insulated
from behind and covered with a glass plate on the side facing the Sun. A
storage tank for the hot water is also required. A more efﬁcient (though
more expensive) design is to surround the black tubes with a vacuum
to provide more complete insulation. Ten million households worldwide
have solar hot water systems.48

Figure 11.11 Design of a solar water heater: a solar collector
connected to a storage tank through a circulating pump. Alternatively,
if the storage is above the collector, the hot water will collect through
gravity ﬂow.

In tropical countries, a solar cooking stove can provide an efﬁcient alternative to stoves burning wood and other traditional fuels. Thermal
energy from the Sun can also be employed effectively in buildings
(it is called passive solar design), in order to provide a modest boost
towards heating the building in winter and, more importantly, to provide for a greater degree of comfort and a more pleasant environment
(see box).
Solar heat can also be employed to provide heating to produce steam
for the generation of electricity. To produce signiﬁcant quantities of
steam, the solar energy has to be concentrated by using mirrors. One
arrangement employs trough-shaped mirrors aligned east-west which
focus the Sun on to an insulated black absorbing tube running the length
of the mirror. A number of such installations have been built, particularly
in the USA, where solar thermal installations provide over 350 MW
of commercial electricity. The high capital cost of such installations,

Solar energy in building design
All buildings beneﬁt from unplanned gains of solar energy through windows and, to a lesser extent,
through the warming of walls and roofs. This is
called ‘passive solar gain’; for a typical house in
the UK it will contribute about ﬁfteen per cent of
the annual space heating requirements. With ‘passive solar design’ this can relatively easily and inexpensively be increased to around thirty per cent,
while increasing the overall degree of comfort and
amenity. The main features of such design are to
place, so far as is possible, the principal living
rooms with their large windows on the south side of
the house, with the cooler areas such as corridors,
stairs, cupboards and garages with the minimum of
window area arranged to provide a buffer on the
north side. Conservatories can also be strategically
placed to trap some solar heat in the winter.
The wall of a building can be designed specifically to act as a passive solar collector, in which

case it is known as ‘solar wall’ (Figure 11.12).49 Its
construction enables sunlight, after passing through
an insulating layer, to heat the surface of a wall of
heavy building blocks that retain the heat and slowly
conduct it into the building. The insulating layer, although allowing sunlight to pass through, prevents
thermal radiation from passing out. A retractable
reﬂective blind can be placed in front of the insulation at night or during the summer when heating of
the building is not required. A set of student residences for 376 students at Strathclyde University in
Glasgow in southwest Scotland has been built with
a ‘solar wall’ on its south-facing side. Even under
the comparatively unfavourable conditions during
winter in Glasgow (the average duration of bright
sunshine in January is only just over one hour per
day) there is a signiﬁcant net gain of heat through
the wall to the building.

open honeycomb channels of transparent polycarbonate material.

The photovoltaic solar cell
The silicon photovoltaic (PV) solar cell consists of
a thin slice of silicon into which appropriate impurities have been introduced to create what is known
as a p–n junction. The most efﬁcient cells are sophisticated constructions using crystalline silicon
as the basic material; they possess efﬁciencies for
the conversion of solar energy into electricity typically of ﬁfteen to twenty per cent; experimental
cells have been produced with efﬁciencies well over
twenty per cent.51 Single crystal silicon is less convenient for mass production than amorphous silicon (for which the conversion efﬁciency is around
ten per cent), which can be deposited in a continuous process on to thin ﬁlms.52 Other alloys (such
as cadmium telluride and copper indium selenide)
with similar photovoltaic properties can also be de-

posited in this way and, because they have higher
efﬁciencies than amorphous silicon, are likely to
compete with silicon for the thin ﬁlm market.53
However, since typically about half the cost of a
solar PV installation is installation cost, the high
efﬁciency of single crystal silicon, which means a
smaller size, remains an important factor.
Cost is of critical importance if PV solar cells
are going to make a signiﬁcant contribution to energy supply. This has been coming down rapidly.
More efﬁcient methods and larger scale production are bringing the cost of solar electricity down
to levels where it can compete with other sources.
Projections up to the year 2020 of the likely cost of
generating electricity from PV sources are shown in
Figure 11.13.

however, assuming a reasonable pay-back period, translates into an electricity cost which, at the moment, is at least three times that from most
conventional sources. Generating plants which incorporate integrated
solar and fossil fuel heat sources in combined cycle operation are currently under development that promise signiﬁcantly lower costs.50

Energy from the Sun

Sunlight can be converted directly into electricity by means of photovoltaic (PV) solar cells (see box on page 302). Solar panels on spacecraft
have provided electrical power for spacecraft from the earliest days of
space research nearly ﬁfty years ago. They now appear in a variety of
ways in everyday life; for instance, as power sources for small calculators or watches. Their efﬁciency for conversion of solar energy into
electrical energy is now generally between just under ten per cent and
twenty per cent. A panel of cells of area one square metre facing full
sunlight will therefore deliver between 100 and 200 W of electrical
power. A cost-effective way of mounting PV modules is on the surface
of manufactured items or built structures rather than as free-standing
arrays. In the fast-growing building-integrated-PV (BIPV) sector, the
PV fa¸cade replaces and avoids the cost of conventional cladding. Installed on rooftops in cities, they provide a way for city dwellers to
contribute renewably to their energy needs. Japan has done the most to
encourage rooftop solar installations and by 2000 had installed 320 MW
capacity. The USA and Germany follow as countries with large rooftop
programmes, the USA with a target by 2010 of one million roofs and
Germany with programme for 100 000. The cost of energy from solar
cells has reduced dramatically over the past twenty years (see box below);
so much so that they can now be employed for a wide range of applications and can also begin to contribute to the large-scale generation of
electricity.
Small PV installations are also suitable, especially for developing
countries, to provide local sources of electricity in rural areas. About a
third of the world’s population have no access to electricity from a central
source. Their predominant need is for small amounts of power for lighting, for radio and television, for refrigerators (for example, for vaccines
at a health clinic) and for pumping water. The cost of PV installations for
these purposes is now competitive with other means of generation (such
as diesel units). Over the twenty years to the year 2000, approximately
1.1 million ‘Solar Home Systems’and ‘Solar Lanterns’ had been installed in Asia, Africa and South American countries.54 Solar Home
Systems provide typically 15–75 W from a solar array (Figure 11.14)
and cost in the range of $US 200–1200. Smaller ‘solar lanterns’ (typically 10–20 W) provide lighting only. Larger installations are required
for public buildings, although they need not be that much larger. Many
small hospitals can beneﬁt from an electrical power source as small
as 1–2 kW. For instance, by 1995, seventy small hospitals in Sri Lanka,
through assistance from the Australian government, had installed 1.3-kW
solar arrays, backed up by 2200 amp-hour batteries, to provide for lighting, refrigeration for vaccines, autoclave sterilisation, pumping for hot
water (produced through a solar-thermal system) and radio. Over

Figure 11.14 A simple ’solar home system’ now being marketed in many
countries in Africa, Asia and South America for a cost of a few hundred US$. An
array of thirty-six solar cells, covering an area of 60 cm × 60 cm, provides
around 40 W of peak power. This is sufﬁcient to charge a car battery that can
power up to three 9-W ﬂuorescent lights and three hours of radio and one hour
of television per day. With more restricted use of these devices or with a larger
solar array, a small refrigerator can be added to the system.

20 000 water pumps are now powered by solar PV and thousands
of communities receive drinking water from solar-PV-powered puriﬁers/pumps. The potential for further growth and development of solar systems is clearly very large. For instance, mini-electrical grids
powered by a combination of solar PV, wind, biomass and diesel are
beginning to emerge especially in the remoter parts of China and
India.55
The total installed world capacity of PV grew from about 500 MW
peak in 1998 to about 1500 MW peak in 2002, an increase of about
thirty per cent per year. With that rate of continued growth it should be
possible to more than meet the projected contribution by PV solar cells
to world energy supply in WEC scenario C of at least 150 GW56 by
the year 2020 (Table 11.5). In the short term, increased development of
local installations is likely to have priority; later, with the expectation of
a signiﬁcant cost reduction (Figure 11.13), penetration into large-scale
electricity generation will become more possible. Eventually, because of
its simplicity, convenience and cleanliness, it is expected that electricity
from solar PV sources will become one of the largest – if not the largest –
of the world’s energy sources.

Other renewable energies

Other renewable energies
We have so far covered the renewable energy sources for which there
is potential for growth on a scale that can make a substantial contribution to overall world energy demand. We should also mention brieﬂy
other renewable energy technologies which contribute to global energy
production and which are of particular importance in certain regions,
namely geothermal energy from deep in the ground and energies from
the tides, currents or waves in the ocean.
The presence of geothermal energy from deep down in the Earth’s
crust makes itself apparent in volcanic eruptions and less dramatically
in geysers and hot springs. The energy available in favourable locations may be employed directly for heating purposes or for generating
electrical power. Although very important in particular places, for instance in Iceland, it is currently only a small contributor (about 0.3%)
to total world energy; its contribution could rise to the order of one per
cent during the next few decades (Table 11.5).
Large amounts of energy are in principle available in movements
of the ocean; but in general they are not easy to exploit. Tidal energy
is the only one currently contributing signiﬁcantly to commercial energy production. The largest tidal energy installation is a barrage across
the estuary at La Rance in France; the ﬂow from the barrage is directed
through turbines as the tide ebbs so generating electricity with a capacity
of up to 240 MW. Several estuaries in the world have been extensively
studied as potential sites for tidal energy installations. The Severn Estuary in the UK, for instance, possesses one of the largest tidal ranges in
the world and has the potential to generate a peak power of over 8000
MW or about six per cent of the total UK electricity demand. Although
the long-term cost of the electricity generated from the largest schemes
could be competitive, the main deterrents to such schemes are the high
capital up-front cost and the signiﬁcant environmental impacts that can
be associated with them. More recent proposals, rather than making use
of estuaries, have been based on the construction of tidal ‘lagoons’ in
suitable shallow regions off shore where there is a large tidal range.57
Turbines in the lagoon walls generate electricity as water ﬂows in and
out of the lagoons. Some of the environmental and economic problems
of barrages built in estuaries are therefore avoided.
The energy in currents (including tidal streams) in the ocean can be
exploited in much the same way as wind energy from the atmosphere is
harnessed. Although the speeds in water are lower than that of the wind,
the greater density of sea water results in higher energy densities and
requires smaller turbine diameters. Substantial energy is also present in
ocean waves and a number of ingenious devices have been designed to

305

306

Energy and transport for the future

turn this into electrical energy.58 The waters around the British Isles contain some of the best opportunities to exploit all forms of tidal and wave
energy. Because of the hostile ocean environment, early exploitation of
some of these may be comparatively costly, but the size of the potential
resource is large. What is urgently needed is the necessary research and
development.

The support and ﬁnancing of renewable energy
Renewable energy on the scale required to meet any stabilisation scenario for carbon dioxide (for instance WEC scenario C – see Table 11.5)
will only be realised if it is competitive in cost with energy from other
sources. Table 11.6 provides a summary of the status and costs, present
and future, of the main sources of renewable energy. Under some circumstances renewable energy sources are already competitive in cost,
for instance in providing local sources of energy where the cost of transporting electricity or other fuel would be signiﬁcant; some examples of
this (such as Fair Isle in Scotland – see box above) have been given.
However, when there is direct competition with fossil fuel energy from
oil and gas, as Table 11.6 shows, many renewable energies at the present
compete only marginally. In due course, as easily recoverable oil and gas
reserves begin to run out, those fuels will become more expensive enabling renewable sources to compete more easily.59 That is some decades
away and, since estimates of recoverable fossil fuel reserves have always
tended to be low, it may be well into the second half of the twenty-ﬁrst
century before any substantial limitation in oil and gas resources occurs.
Before then in order that renewables begin to displace fossil fuels to the
extent required, appropriate ﬁnancial incentives must be introduced to
bring about the change.
As we saw in Chapter 9, the basis of such incentives would be the
principle that the polluter should pay by the allocation of an environmental cost to carbon dioxide emissions. There are three main ways in
which this can be done. Firstly, through a direct subsidy being provided
by governments to renewable energy. Secondly, through the imposition
of a carbon tax. Suppose, for instance, that through taxes or levies an
additional cost of between $US 50 and 100 per tonne of carbon (ﬁgures
mentioned in the context of environmental costs towards the end of Chapter 9) were to be associated with carbon dioxide emissions, between 0.5
and 2.5 cents per kWh would be added to the price of electricity from
fossil fuel sources (Table 11.6) – which could bring some renewables
(for instance, biomass and wind energy) into competition with them.60
It is interesting to note that in many countries substantial subsidies are

The support and ﬁnancing of renewable energy

attached to energy – worldwide they amount on average to the equivalent
of about $US 40 per tonne of carbon.61 A start with incentives would
therefore be made if subsidies were removed from energy generated from
fossil fuel sources.
A third way of introducing an environmental cost to fossil fuel energy
is through tradeable permits in carbon dioxide emissions, as are being introduced under arrangements for the management of the Kyoto Protocol
(Chapter 10, page 248). These control the total amount of carbon dioxide
that a country or region may emit while providing the means for industries
to trade permits for their allowable emissions within the overall total.
These ﬁscal measures are relatively easy to apply in the electricity
sector. Electricity, however, only accounts for about one-third of the
world’s primary energy use. They also need to be applied to solid, liquid
or gaseous fuels that are used for heating, industry and transport. It
has already been mentioned that, currently, liquid fuels such as ethanol
derived from biomass are about twice as expensive as those derived
from oil. Although there is an expectation that the processing of biomass
will become more efﬁcient62 – the rapid development of technologies
in bioengineering will help – it is unlikely that in the short term the
substitution of biomass-derived fuels will occur on a signiﬁcant scale
without the application of appropriate ﬁnancial incentives.
There is a further crucial area where incentives are also required
if renewable energy sources are going to come on stream sufﬁciently
rapidly to meet the need. That is the area of research and development
(R & D) – the latter is especially vital. Government R & D, averaged
worldwide, currently runs at about ten billion US dollars per year or about
one per cent of worldwide capital investment in the energy industry of
about one trillion (million million) dollars per year (about three per cent
of GWP). On average, in developed countries it has fallen by about a
factor of two since the mid 1980s. In some countries the fall has been
much greater. This is particularly true in the UK where governmentsponsored energy R & D fell by about a factor of ten from the mid 1980s
to 1998 when, in proportion to GDP, it was only one-ﬁfth of that in
the USA and one-seventeenth of that in Japan.63 It is surprising – and
concerning – that such falls in R & D have occurred at a time when the
need to bring new renewable energy sources on line is greater than it has
ever been. Energy R & D should be substantially increased to well over
one per cent of the energy’s total investment so as to enable promising
renewable technologies to be introduced more quickly.
More appreciation of the value of renewable energy sources and
their potential together with signals such as increased R & D in renewable technologies will provide necessary encouragement for the rapid
increase in investment in these sources that is required. We have already

307

308

Energy and transport for the future

mentioned that sustained growth of thirty per cent or more per year is
needed in wind and solar energy in order to meet the targets for 2020
set by carbon dioxide stabilisation scenarios (e.g. WEC scenario C). Increased growth in biomass sources is also necessary. This means that an
increasing and substantial fraction of capital investment in the energy
industry will have to go into new renewable sources. In the box below
are listed some of the policy instruments that need to be applied for this
revolution in the way we generate our energy to really get under way.
In a recent speech, Lord John Browne, the Group Chief Executive of
British Petroleum, has emphasised the importance of actively planning
for the long term. After explaining the steps to be taken to combat change
in the energy sector and the major investments that will be required he
goes on to say64 :
If such steps are to be taken, it is important to demonstrate the real value of
taking a long-term approach which transcends the gap in time between the
costs of investment and the delivery of the beneﬁts. Political decisions are
often taken on a very short-term basis and the challenge is to demonstrate
the beneﬁts of the actions which need to be taken for the long term . . .
The role of business is to transform the possibilities into reality. And that
means being severely practical – undertaking very focused research and
then experimenting with the different possibilities. The advantage of the
fact that the energy business is now global is that international companies
can both access the knowledge around the world and can then apply it very
quickly throughout their operations.

Nuclear energy
An energy source mentioned rather little so far is nuclear energy. It is
not strictly a renewable source, but it has considerable attractiveness
from the point of view of sustainable development because it does not
produce greenhouse gas emissions (apart from a small amount, which
is used in making the materials employed in the construction of nuclear
power stations) and because the rate at which it uses up resources of
radioactive material is small compared to the total resource available.
It is only efﬁciently generated in large units, so is suitable for supplying power to national grids or to large urban connurbations, but not
for small, more localised supplies. An advantage of nuclear energy installations is that the technology is known; they can be built now and
therefore contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in the
short term. The cost of nuclear energy compared with energy from fossil fuel sources is often a subject of debate; exactly where it falls in
relation to the others depends on the return expected on the up-front

Nuclear energy

Policy instruments
Action in the energy sector on the scale required to mitigate the effects of
climate change through reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases
will require signiﬁcant policy initiatives by governments in co-operation
with industry. Some of these initiatives are the following65 :

r putting in place appropriate institutional and structural frameworks;

r energy pricing strategies (carbon or energy taxes and reduced
energy subsidies);

r reducing or removing other subsidies (e.g. agricultural and transport subsidies) that tend to increase greenhouse gas emissions;

r tradeable emissions permits66 ;
r voluntary programmes and negotiated agreements with industry;
r utility demand-side management programmes;
r regulatory programmes, including minimum energy efﬁciency
standards (e.g. for appliances and fuel economy);

r stimulating research and development to make new technologies
available;

r market pull and demonstration programmes that stimulate the development and application of advanced technologies;

r renewable energy incentives during market build-up;
r incentives such as provisions for accelerated depreciation or reduced costs for consumers;

r information dissemination for consumers especially directed towards necessary behavioural changes;

r education and training programmes;
r technological transfer to developing countries;
r provision for capacity building in developing countries;
r options that also support other economic and environmental goals.

capital cost and on the cost of decommissioning spent power stations
(including the cost of nuclear waste disposal), which represent a significant element of the total. Recent estimates are that the cost of nuclear
electricity is similar to the cost of electricity from natural gas when
the additional cost of capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide is
added.67
The continued importance of nuclear energy is recognised in the
WEC energy scenarios, which all assume growth in this energy source
in the twenty-ﬁrst century. How much growth will be realised will depend
to a large degree on how well the nuclear industry is able to satisfy the
general public of the safety of its operations; in particular that the risk
of accidents from new installations is negligible, that nuclear waste can

309

310

Energy and transport for the future

be safely disposed of, that the distribution of dangerous nuclear material
can be effectively controlled and that it can be prevented from getting
into the wrong hands.
A further nuclear energy source with great potential depends on
fusion rather than ﬁssion (see box below in next section, page 312, ‘Power
from Nuclear Fusion’).

Technology for the longer term
This chapter has concentrated mostly on what can be achieved with
available and proven technology during the next few decades. It is also
interesting to speculate about the more distant future and what relatively
new technologies may become dominant during the twenty-ﬁrst century. In doing so, of course, we are almost certainly going to paint a
more conservative picture than will actually occur. Imagine how well
we would have done if asked in 1900 to speculate about technology
change by 2000! Technology will certainly surprise us with possibilities
not thought of at the moment. But that need not deter us from being
speculative!
There is general agreement that a central component of a sustainable
energy future is the fuel cell that with high efﬁciency converts hydrogen
and oxygen directly into electricity (see box below). In the fuel cell the
electrolytic process of generating hydrogen and oxygen from water is
reversed – the energy released by recombination of the hydrogen and
oxygen is turned back into electrical energy. Fuel cells can have high
efﬁciency of ﬁfty to eighty per cent and they are pollution free; their
only output other than electricity is water. They offer the prospect of
high efﬁciency, small-scale power generation. They can be made in a
large range of sizes suitable for use in transport vehicles or to act as
local sources of electrical power for homes, for commercial premises or
for many applications in industry. Much research and development has
been put into fuel cells in recent years that has conﬁrmed their potential
as an important future technology. There seems little doubt that they will
come into widespread use within the next decade.
Hydrogen for fuel cells can be generated from a wide variety of
renewable sources (see box above). Of these, from many points of
view, the one that is most attractive is through the hydrolysis of water
using electricity from photovoltaic (PV) cells exposed to sunlight
(Figure 11.16) – a very efﬁcient process; over ninety per cent of the
electrical energy can be stored in the hydrogen. There are many regions
of the world where sunshine is plentiful and where suitable land not
useful for other purposes would be readily available. It is a very clean,
non-polluting technology, easily adaptable to mass production. The cost

Fuel cell technology
A fuel cell converts the chemical energy of a fuel
directly into electricity without ﬁrst burning it to
produce heat. It is similar to a battery in its construction. Two electrodes (Figure 11.15) are separated
by an electrolyte which transmits ions but not electrons. A fuel cell has a theoretical efﬁciency of one
hundred per cent. Fuel cells have been constructed

with efﬁciencies in the range of forty to eighty per
cent.
Hydrogen for fuel cells may be supplied from a
wide variety of sources, from coal or other biomass
(see Note 24), from natural gas,68 or from the hydrolysis of water using electricity generated from
renewable sources such as wind power or solar photovoltaic (PV) cells (see box on page 302).

Figure 11.15 Schematic of a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell. Hydrogen is supplied to the porous anode
(negative electrode) where it dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+ ) and electrons. The H+ ions migrate
through the electrolyte (typically an acid) to the cathode (positive electrode) where they combine with
electrons (supplied through the external electrical circuit) and oxygen to form water.

of PV electricity has been coming down rapidly (Figure 11.13) – a trend
that will continue with technological advances and with increased scale
of production.
Hydrogen is also important for other reasons. It provides a medium
for energy storage and it can easily be transported by pipeline or bulk
transport. The main technical problem to be overcome is to ﬁnd efﬁcient
and compact ways of storing hydrogen. Present technology (primarily
in cylinders at high pressure) is bulky and heavy, especially for use in
transport vehicles. A number of other possibilities are being explored.
Most of the technology necessary for a solar-hydrogen energy
economy is available now, although the cost of energy supplied this way

would at the moment be several times that from fossil fuel sources.69
As the technology for its further development progresses and as largerscale production becomes possible, the cost will undoubtedly reduce
substantially. If its attractiveness from an environmental point of view

Power from nuclear fusion
When at extremely high temperatures the nuclei of hydrogen (or one
of its isotopes, deuterium or tritium) are fused to form helium, a large
amount of energy is released. This is the energy source that powers the
Sun. To make it work on Earth, deuterium and tritium are used; from 1 kg,
1 GW can be generated for one day. The supply of material is essentially
limitless and no unacceptable pollution is produced. A temperature of
one hundred million degrees celsius is required for the reaction to occur.
To keep the hot plasma away from the walls of the reaction vessel,
it is conﬁned by strong magnetic ﬁelds in a ‘magnetic bottle’ called a
Tokamak. The challenges are to create effective conﬁnement and a robust
vessel.
Fusion power70 has been produced on Earth at levels up to 16 MW.
This has generated the conﬁdence in a consortium of countries to build
a new power-station-scale device called ITER capable of 500 MW with
the object of demonstrating commercial viability. If this is successful, it
is estimated that the ﬁrst commercial plant could be in operation within
thirty years.

Technology for the longer term

Energy policy in the UK
Three important reports concerned with energy policy have been published in the UK in the last few years.
The ﬁrst of these is Energy in a Changing Climate published in 2000
by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP)71 – an
expert body that provides advice to government. It supported the concept
of ‘contraction and convergence’ (Figure 10.3) as the best basis for future
international action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pointed out
that application of this concept would imply a goal of sixty per cent
reduction in UK emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050. National quotas
calculated on this basis should be combined with international trading
in emission permits. To achieve such a goal more effective measures
are needed to increase energy efﬁciency (especially in buildings) and
to encourage the growth of renewable energy sources for instance by
greatly increased research and development.
The second report is an Energy Review by the Policy and Innovation
Unit (PIU) of the UK Cabinet Ofﬁce72 published in 2002. This review
provided an important input into the third report which is a statement of
energy policy published by the UK government in 200373 known as the
Energy White Paper and entitled Our Energy Future: Creating a Low
Carbon Economy. The White Paper accepts the need for a UK strategy to
meet the goal set by the RCEP of a sixty per cent reduction in emissions
by 2050. The main pillars of the strategy, that must be implemented immediately, will be the aggressive promotion of energy efﬁciency (targets
in the domestic sector of twenty per cent improvement in 2010 and a
further twenty per cent by 2020) and expanding the role of renewables
(target of twenty per cent electricity generated from renewable sources
by 2020). In addition, the options of new investment in nuclear power
and in clean coal (through carbon sequestration) need to be kept open
and further explored.
An estimate is provided in the review of the cost to the UK economy
of realising the RCEP goal. The cost estimate is not large; it is expressed
as a possible slowing in the growth of the UK economy of six months
over the ﬁfty-year period.
The picture of the future that these reports present is one where
even by 2020 large changes will have occurred. There will be moves
to more local energy supplies (much of it from renewable sources), to
widespread use of vehicles driven by hybrid engines or by fuel cells and
to the beginning of the development of an energy infrastructure based
on hydrogen rather than on coal, oil or gas.

313

Energy and transport for the future

were recognised as a dominant reason for its rapid development, a solarhydrogen economy could take off more rapidly than most energy analysts
are currently predicting.
Iceland is a country that is in the forefront of the development
of a hydrogen economy and aspires to be largely free of the use of
fossil fuels by 2030–2040. Much of its electricity already comes from
hydroelectric or geothermal sources. The ﬁrst hydrogen fuel station in
Iceland was opened in April 2003 and several buses powered by fuel
cells are its ﬁrst customers.
Finally, in this section looking at the longer term, there is the possibility of power from nuclear fusion, the energy that powers the Sun
(see box). If this can be harnessed, virtually limitless supplies of energy
could be provided. The result of the next phase in this programme of
work will be watched with great interest.

Summary
This chapter has outlined the ways in which energy for human life and
industry is currently provided. Growth in conventional energy sources
at the rate required to meet the world’s future energy needs will generate greatly increased emissions of greenhouse gases that will lead to
unacceptable climate change. Such would not be consistent with the
agreements reached at the United Nations Conference on Environment
and Development at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 when the countries of
the world committed themselves to the action necessary to address the
problems of energy and the environment. During the twenty-ﬁrst century, emissions of carbon dioxide must be substantially reduced (e.g. as
in WEC scenario C) as required by the Objective of the Climate Convention so that the concentration in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide is
stabilised by the end of the century. In order to achieve the large changes
required, four areas of action are essential:
r Many studies have shown that in most developed countries improvements in energy efﬁciency of thirty per cent or more can be achieved
at little or no net cost or even at some overall saving. But industry and
individuals will require not just encouragement, but modest incentives
if the savings are to be realised.
r Much of the necessary technology is available for renewable energy
sources (especially ‘modern’ biomass, wind and solar energy) that
can go a long way towards replacing energy from fossil fuels to be
developed and implemented. For this to be done on an adequate scale,
an economic framework with appropriate incentives will need to be set
up. Policy options available include the removal of subsidies, carbon or

Questions

energy taxes (which recognise the environmental cost associated with
the use of fossil fuels) and tradeable permits coupled with capping of
emissions.
r Arrangements are needed to ensure that technology is available for all
countries (including developing countries through technology transfer) to develop their energy plans with high efﬁciency and to deploy
renewable energy sources (for instance, local solar energy or wind
generators) as widely as possible.
r With world investment in the energy industry running at around one
million million US dollars per year, there is a great responsibility
on both governments and industry to ensure that energy investments
(including an adequate level of research and development) take longterm environmental requirements fully into account.
These actions require clear policies, commitment and resolve on the
part of governments, industries and individual consumers. Because of
the long life time of large energy infrastructure (e.g. power stations) and
also because of the time required for the changes required to be realised,
there is an urgency about the actions required. As the World Energy
Council point out ‘the real challenge is to communicate the reality that
the switch to alternative forms of supply will take many decades, and
thus the realization of the need, and commencement of the appropriate
action, must be now’ (their italics).74
Questions
1 Estimate how much energy you use per year in your home or your apartment.
How much of this comes from fossil fuels? What does it contribute to emissions
of carbon dioxide?
2 Estimate how much energy your car uses per year. What does this contribute
to emissions of carbon dioxide?
3 Look up estimates made at different times over the last thirty years of the size
of world reserves of coal, oil and gas. What do you deduce from the trend of
these estimates?
4 Estimate the annual energy saving for your country as a result of: (1) unnecessary lights in all homes being switched off; (2) all homes changing all
light bulbs to low energy ones; (3) all homes being maintained 1 ◦ C cooler
during the winter.
5 Find out for your country the fuel sources which contribute to electricity
supply. Suppose a typical home heated by electricity in the winter is converted
to gas heating, what would be the change in annual carbon dioxide emissions?
6 Find out about the cost of heat pumps and building insulation. For a typical building, compare the costs (capital and running costs) of reducing by
seventy-ﬁve per cent the energy required to heat it by installing heat pumps
or by adding to the insulation.

Energy and transport for the future

7 Visit a large electrical store and collate information relating to the energy consumption and the performance of domestic appliances: refrigerators, cookers, microwave ovens and washing machines. Which do you think are the
most energy efﬁcient and how do they compare with the least energy efﬁcient? Also how well labelled were the appliances with respect to energy
consumption and efﬁciency?
8 Consider a ﬂat-roofed house of typical size in a warm, sunny country
with a ﬂat roof incorporating 50 mm thickness of insulation (refer to
Table 11.3). Estimate the extra energy which would have to be removed
by air conditioning if the roof were painted black rather than white. How
much would this be reduced if the insulation were increased to a thickness
of 150 mm?
9 Rework the calculations of total heating required for the building considered
in Table 11.3 supposing insulation 250 mm thick (the Danish standard) were
installed in the cavity walls and in the roof.
10 Look up articles about the environmental and social impact of large dams.
Do you consider the beneﬁts of the power generated by hydroelectric means
are worth the environmental and social damage?
11 Suppose an area of 10 km2 was available for use for renewable energy sources,
to grow biomass, to mount PV solar cells or to mount wind generators. What
criteria would determine which use would be most effective? Compare the
effectiveness for each use on a typical area of your country.
12 What do you consider the most important factors which prevent the greater
use of nuclear energy? How do you think their seriousness compares with
the costs or damages arising from other forms of energy production?
13 In the IPCC 1995 Report chapter 19, you will ﬁnd information about the
LESS scenarios. In particular estimates are provided, for the different alternatives, of the amount of land that will be needed in different parts of the
world for the production of energy from biomass. For your own country or
region, ﬁnd out how easily, on the timescale required, it is likely that this
amount of land could be provided. What would be the likely consequences
arising from using the land for biomass production rather than for other
purposes?
14 In making arguments for a carbon tax would you attempt to relate it to the
likely cost of damage from Global Warming (Chapter 9), or would you relate
it to what is required to enable appropriate renewable energies to compete
at an adequate level? From the information in Table 11.6 and any further
data to which you have access, what level of carbon tax do you consider
would be likely to enable there to be greater employment of different forms
of renewable energy: (1) at the present time, (2) in 2020?
15 In discussing policy options, attention is often given to ‘win-win’ situations
or to those with a ‘double dividend’, i.e. situations in which, when a particular
action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, additional beneﬁts arise
as a bonus. Describe examples of such situations.
16 Of the policy options listed towards the end of the chapter, which do you
think could be most effective in your country?

Notes

17 List the various environmental impacts of different renewable energy
sources, biomass, wind and solar PV. How would you assess the seriousness of these impacts compared with the advantages to the environment
of the contribution from these sources to the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions?

Chapter 12

The global village

The preceding chapters have considered the various strands of the global
warming story and the action that should be taken. In this last chapter
I want ﬁrst to present some of the challenges of global warming, especially those which arise because of its global nature. I then want to put
global warming in the context of other major global problems faced by
humankind.

The challenges of global warming
We have noted in the course of our discussion that global warming is not
the only environmental problem. For instance, coastal regions are liable to
subsidence for other reasons; water supplies in many places are already
being depleted faster than they are being replenished and agricultural
land is being lost through soil erosion. Many other reasons, locally and regionally, could be listed for the occurrence of environmental degradation.
However, the importance of global warming is not diminished by the existence of these other environmental problems; in fact their existence will
generally exacerbate its effects – as, for instance, we noted on page 150
when looking at the effect of sea level rise on Bangladesh. It is generally
beneﬁcial to tackle all related environmental problems together.
Local degradation of the environment is generally the result of particular action in the locality. To give an example, subsidence occurs
because of the over-extraction of groundwater. In these cases the community where the malpractice is occurring suffers the damage that it
causes and the principle that polluters should pay the cost of their pollution is relatively easy to apply.
322

The challenges of global warming

The particular characteristic of global warming, compared with most
environmental problems, is that it is global. However, though everybody
contributes to it to a greater or lesser extent, its adverse impact will not
fall uniformly. Many, especially in the developing world, will experience
signiﬁcant damage; some others, mostly in the developed world, may in
fact gain from it. This non-uniformity of impact also applies to local pollution. But, for local pollution, the adverse effects are more apparent and
immediate than is the case with global warming. It is therefore imperative that information about the effects of the burning of fossil fuels on
the global climate becomes more widely available, so leading to greater
awareness that an individual burning fossil fuels anywhere in the world
has impact globally. And a global problem demands a global solution.
That the ‘polluter should pay’ when the pollution is global rather
than local is one of the Principles (Principle 16) enshrined in the Rio
Declaration of June 1992. Chapters 9 and 10 presented some of the
mechanisms that have been devised to apply this principle on a global
scale.
There is already some experience in tackling an environmental problem of global scale: the depletion of stratospheric ozone because of the
injection by humans of chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs) into the atmosphere
possesses similar global characteristics to the global warming problem.
An effective mechanism for tackling and solving the problem of ozone
depletion has been established through the Montreal Protocol. All nations
contributing to the damage have agreed to phase out their emissions of
harmful substances. The richer nations involved have also agreed to provide ﬁnance and technology transfer to assist developing countries to
comply. A way forward for addressing global environmental problems
has therefore been charted.
Moving in that direction in the case of global warming will not be
easy because the problem is so much larger and because it strikes so
much nearer to the core of human resources and activities – such as
energy and transport – upon which our quality of life depends. However,
abatement of the use of fossil fuels need not destroy or even diminish our
quality of life; it should actually improve it! In tackling the problem of
global warming there are particular responsibilities and challenges for
different communities of expertise which generally transcend national
boundaries.
r For the world’s scientists the brief is clear: to provide better information especially about the expected climate change on the regional
and local level, always keeping an appropriate emphasis on the uncertainties of prediction. Not only politicians and policymakers but
also ordinary people need the information provided in the clearest

323

324

The global village

possible form, in all countries and at all levels of society. Information
is especially required about changes that may occur in the extremes
of weather and climate. Scientists also have an important role in contributing to the research necessary to underpin the technical developments, for example in the energy, transport, forestry and agriculture
sectors, required by the adaptation and mitigation strategies we have
described.
r In the world of politics, it is over twenty years since Sir Crispin Tickell
drew attention to the need for international action addressing climate
change.1 Since then, a great deal of progress has been made with
the signing in Rio in 1992 of the Framework Convention on Climate
Change and with the setting up of the Sustainable Development Commission in the United Nations. The challenges presented to the politicians and decision makers by the Convention are, ﬁrstly, to achieve the
right balance of development against environmental concern, that is to
achieve sustainable development, and secondly, to ﬁnd the resolve to
turn the many ﬁne words of the Convention into adequate and genuine
action (including both adaptation and its mitigation) regarding climate
change.
r In describing the likely impacts of global warming and the ways they
can be alleviated, I have frequently stressed the role of technology.
The necessary technology is available. The challenge of its implementation, supported by appropriate investment, needs to be picked
up enthusiastically and innovatively by the world’s industry. Too often
environmental concerns and environmental regulation are seen by industry as a threat when, in fact, they are an opportunity. As we saw
in Chapter 11, the emerging technologies associated with energy efﬁciency in all its aspects, renewable energy production and the efﬁcient
use and recycling of materials should bring increased employment in
industry at a high level of skill and technical training. Because of increasing public awareness of the environment and of the need for its
preservation, the industries that are likely to grow and ﬂourish during the twenty-ﬁrst century are those that have taken environmental
considerations ﬁrmly on board.
r The responsibilities of industry must also be seen in the world context. It is the imagination, innovation, commitment and activity of
industry that will do most to solve the problem. Industries that have
a global perspective, working as appropriate with governments, need
to develop a technical, ﬁnancial and policy strategy to this end. An
important component of this strategy is the transfer of appropriate
technology between countries, especially in the energy sector. This
has been speciﬁcally recognised in the Climate Convention which in
Article 4, paragraph 5 states: ‘The developed country Parties . . . shall

The challenges of global warming

take all practical steps to promote, facilitate and ﬁnance, as appropriate,
the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies and
know-how to other Parties, particularly developing country Parties, to
enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention.’
r There are also new challenges for economists; for instance, that of adequately representing environmental costs (especially including those
‘costs’ that cannot be valued in terms of money) and the value of
‘natural’ capital, especially when it is of a global kind – as mentioned
in Chapter 9. There is the further problem of dealing fairly with all
countries. No country wants to be put at a disadvantage economically
because it has taken its responsibilities with respect to global warming more seriously than others. As economic and other instruments
(for instance, taxes, subsidies, capping and trading arrangements, regulations or other measures) are devised to provide the incentives for
appropriate action regarding global warming by governments or by
individuals, these must be seen to be both fair and effective for all nations. Economists working with politicians and decision makers need
to ﬁnd imaginative solutions which recognise not just environmental
concerns but political realities.
r There is an important role for communicators and educators. Everybody in the world is involved in climate change so everybody needs
to be properly informed about it. They require to understand the evidence for it, its causes, the distribution of its impacts and the action
that can be taken to alleviate them. Climate change is a complex topic;
the challenge to educators and the media is to inform in ways that are
understandable, comprehensive, honest and balanced.
r All countries will need to adapt to the climate change that applies
in their region. For many developing countries this will not be easy
because of increased ﬂoods, droughts or signiﬁcant rise in sea level.
Reductions in risks from disasters are some of the most important
adaptation strategies. A challenge for aid agencies therefore is to prepare for more frequent and intense disasters in vulnerable countries;
the International Red Cross has already taken the lead in this.2
Finally, it is important to recognise that the problem is not only global
but long-term – the time scales of climate change, of major infrastructure change in energy generation or transport or of major changes in
programmes such as forestry are of the order of several decades. The
programme of action must therefore be seen as both urgent and evolving,
based on the continuing scientiﬁc, technical and economic assessments.
As the IPCC 1995 Report states, ‘The challenge is not to ﬁnd the best
policy today for the next 100 years, but to select a prudent strategy and
to adjust it over time in the light of new information’.3

325

326

The global village

Not the only global problem
Global warming is not the only global problem. There are other issues of
a global scale and we need to see global warming in their context. Four
problems of particular importance impact on the global warming issue.
The ﬁrst is population growth. When I was born there were about
2000 million people in the world. At the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst
century there were 6000 million. During the lifetime of my grandchildren
it is likely to rise to at least 8000 million. Most of the growth will be in
developing countries; by 2020 they will contain over eighty per cent of
the world’s people. These new people will all make demands for food,
energy and work to generate the means of livelihood – all with associated
implications for global warming.
The second issue is that of poverty and the increasing disparity in
wealth between the developed and the developing world. The gap between the rich nations and the poor nations is becoming wider. The ﬂow
of wealth in the world is from the poorer nations to the richer ones. Increasingly there are demands that more justice and equity be realised
within the world’s communities. The Prince of Wales has drawn attention to the strong links that exist between population growth, poverty
and environmental degradation (see box below).

Poverty and population growth
The Prince of Wales, in addressing the World Commission on Environment and Development on 22 April 1992, spoke as follows7 :
I do not want to add to the controversy over cause and effect with
respect to the Third World’s problems. Sufﬁce it to say that I don’t, in all
logic, see how any society can improve its lot when population growth
regularly exceeds economic growth. The factors which will reduce population growth are, by now, easily identiﬁed: a standard of health care
that makes family planning viable, increased female literacy, reduced
infant mortality and access to clean water. Achieving them, of course,
is more difﬁcult – but perhaps two simple truths need to be writ large
over the portals of every international gathering about the environment:
we will not slow the birth rate until we address poverty. And we will
not protect the environment until we address the issue of poverty and
population growth in the same breath.

The third global issue is that of the consumption of resources, which
in many cases is contributing to the problem of global warming. Many of
the resources now being used cannot be replaced, yet we are using them
at an unsustainable rate. In other words, because of the rate at which we

The conception and conduct of environmental research

are depleting them, we are seriously affecting their use even at a modest
level by future generations. Further, over eighty per cent of resources are
consumed by twenty per cent of the world’s population and to propagate
modern western patterns of consumption into the developing world is
just not realistic. An important component of sustainable development,
therefore, is sustainable consumption4 of all resources.
The fourth issue is that of global security. Our traditional understanding of security is based on the concept of the sovereign state with
secure borders against the outside world. But communications, industry
and commerce increasingly ignore state borders, and problems like that
of global warming and the other global issues we have mentioned transcend national boundaries. Security therefore also needs to take on more
of a global dimension.
The impacts of climate change may well pose a threat to security. One
of the most recent wars has been fought over oil. It has been suggested that
wars of the future could be fought over water.5 The threat of conﬂict must
be greater if nations lose scarce water supplies or the means of livelihood
as a result of climate change. A dangerous level of tension could easily
arise, with large numbers of environmental refugees. As has been pointed
out by Admiral Sir Julian Oswald,6 who has been deeply concerned with
British defence policy, a broader strategy regarding security needs to be
developed which considers inter alia environmental threats as a possible
source of conﬂict. In addressing the appropriate action to combat such
threats, it may be better overall and more cost-effective in security terms
to allocate resources to the removal or the alleviation of the environmental
threat rather than to military or other measures to deal head-on with the
security problem itself.

The conception and conduct of environmental
research
While completing the writing of this last chapter I attended the opening
of the Zuckerman Centre for Connective Environmental Research at the
University of East Anglia – a centre devoted to interdisciplinary research
on the environment. An opening lecture was given by William Clark, Professor of International Science, Public Policy and Human Development
at Harvard University.8 I was particularly struck by his remarks concerning the changes that are necessary in the way research is conceived and
conducted if science (both natural and social) and technology are going
to provide more adequate support to environmental sustainability. He
pointed out the need to address all aspects of a problem both in the conception of the research and in its conduct and particularly emphasised
the following four requirements:

327

328

The global village

r An integrative, holistic approach that considers the interactions between multiple stresses and between various possible solutions. Such
an approach also seeks to integrate perspectives from both the natural
and the social sciences, so as to understand better the dynamical interplay by which environment shapes society and society in turn reshapes
environment. And these various integrations must also be in a global
context.
r A goal of ﬁnding solutions not just of characterising problems. There
is a tendency amongst scientists to talk forever about problems but
leave solutions to others. Applied research seeking solutions is just as
challenging and worthy as so-called fundamental research identifying
and describing the problems.
r Ownership by both scientists and stakeholders.9 People are more prepared to change their behaviour or beliefs in response to knowledge
that they have had a hand in researching or shaping.
r Scientists must see themselves more as facilitators of social learning
and less as sources of social guidance. The problems faced in environmental research are such that solutions will only be reached after
a long and iterative learning process in which many sectors of society
as well as scientists must be included.
Two other qualities that need to govern our attitude to research that
have often received emphasis in this book are those of honesty (especially
accuracy and balance in the presentation of results) and humility (see, for
instance, the fourth bullet in the last paragraph and the quotation from
Thomas Huxley in Chapter 8, page 211). Together with the theme of
Holism from the last paragraph, they make up 3 Hs, an alliteration that
assists in keeping them all in mind.

The goal of environmental stewardship
In the western world there are many material goals: economic growth,
social welfare, better transport, more leisure and so on. But for our fulﬁlment as human beings we desperately need not just material challenges,
but challenges of a moral or spiritual kind. There are strong connections,
which I drew out in Chapter 8, between our basic attitudes, including
religious belief, and environmental concern. I drew a picture of humans
as stewards or gardeners of the Earth. Many people in the world are
already deeply involved in a host of ways in matters of environmental
concern. Such concern could, however, with beneﬁt to us all, be elevated
to a higher public and political level. The United Nations, so far as it
is able, has laid out a course of action. In an article in Time Magazine
at the time of the Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg

The goal of environmental stewardship

last August, Koﬁ Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations
presented ‘Competing Futures’ in the following terms10 :
Imagine a future of relentless storms and ﬂoods; islands and heavily
inhabited coastal regions inundated by rising sea levels; fertile soils
rendered barren by drought and the desert’s advance; mass migrations of
environmental refugees; and armed conﬂicts over water and precious
natural resources.
Then, think again – for one might just as easily conjure a more
hopeful picture: of green technologies; liveable cities; energy-efﬁcient
homes, transport and industry; and rising standards of living for all the
people not just a fortunate minority. The choice between these competing
visions is ours to make.

What the individual can do
I have spelled out the responsibilities of experts of all kinds – scientists,
economists, technologists, politicians, industrialists, communicators and
educators. There are important contributions also to be made by ordinary
individuals to help to mitigate the problem of global warming.12 Some
of these are to:

r ensure maximum energy efﬁciency in the home – through good

r

r

insulation (see box on page 280) against cold in winter and heat
in summer and by making sure that rooms are not overheated and
that light is not wasted;
as consumers, take energy use into account, e.g. by buying goods
that last longer and from more local sources and buying appliances
with high energy efﬁciency;
support, where possible, the provision of energy from non-fossilfuel sources; for instance, purchase ‘green’ electricity (i.e. electricity from renewable sources) wherever this option is available13 ;
drive a fuel-efﬁcient car and choose means of transport that tend to
minimise overall energy use; for instance, where possible, walking
or cycling;
check, when buying wood products, that they originate from a
renewable source;
contribute to projects that reduce carbon dioxide emissions – this
can be a way of compensating for some of the emissions to which
we contribute, e.g. from aircraft journeys14 ;
through the democratic process, encourage local and national governments to deliver policies which properly take the environment
into account.

329

330

The global village

An encouraging development is the growing interest of some of the
world’s largest companies in tackling the problems posed by global
warming. Many are aggressively pursuing (e.g. through internal trading
arrangements) the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions within their
operations. Also many (e.g. two of the largest oil companies, Shell and
British Petroleum) are putting strong investment into renewable energies.
John Browne, the chief executive of BP, has said:11
No single company or country can solve the problem of climate change. It
would be foolish and arrogant to pretend otherwise. But I hope we can
make a difference – not least to the tone of the debate – by showing what is
possible through constructive action.

The challenge is indeed for everybody, from individuals, communities,
industries and governments through to multinationals, especially for
those in the relatively afﬂuent Western world, to take on board thoroughly this urgent task of the environmental stewardship of our Earth.
And none of us should argue that there is nothing we can usefully do.
Edmund Burke, a British parliamentarian of 200 years ago, said:
Noone made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could
do so little.

Questions
1 List and describe the most important environmental problems in your country. Evaluate how each might be exacerbated under the type of climate change
expected with global warming.
2 It is commonly stated that my pollution or my country’s pollution is so small
compared with the whole, that any contribution I or my country can make
towards solving the problem is negligible. What arguments can you make to
counter this attitude?
3 Speak to people you know who are involved with industry and ﬁnd out their
attitudes to local and global environmental concerns. What are the important
arguments that persuade industry to take the environment seriously?
4 Al Gore, Vice-President of the United States in 1996–2000, has proposed a
plan for saving the world’s environment.15 He has called it ‘A Global Marshall Plan’ paralleled after the Marshall Plan through which the United States
assisted western Europe to recover and rebuild after the Second World War.
Resources for the plan would need to come from the world’s major wealthy
countries. He has proposed ﬁve strategic goals for the plan: (1) the stabilisation of world population; (2) the rapid creation and development of environmentally appropriate technologies; (3) a comprehensive and ubiquitous
change in the economic ‘rules of the road’ by which we measure the impact
of our decisions on the environment; (4) the negotiation of a new generation
of international agreements, that must be sensitive to the vast differences

Notes

of capability and need between developed and developing nations; (5) the
establishment of a cooperative plan for educating the world’s citizens about
our global environment. Consider these ﬁve goals. Are they sufﬁciently comprehensive? Are there important goals that he has omitted?
How do you think governments can best move forward towards strategic
goals for the environment? How can citizens be persuaded to contribute to
government action if it involves making sacriﬁces, for example paying more
in tax?
Can you add to the list in the box at the end of the chapter of contributions
that the individual can make?
The Jubilee 2000 campaign has worked towards the cancellation of Third
World debt possibly in return for appropriate environmental action. Discuss
whether this is a good idea and how it might be made more successful.
Millions of people (especially children) die in the world’s poorer countries
because they lack clean water. It is sometimes argued that the resources that
might be used in reducing carbon dioxide emissions would be better used in
making sure that everyone has access to clean water. Do you agree with this
argument? If so how could the result be realised in practice?
It has been suggested that anthropogenic climate change should be considered as a Weapon of Mass Destruction. Discuss the validity of this comparison.
Consider the requirements for the conception and conduct of research that are
detailed on page 327–8. Do you consider that they could be components of a
check-list against which research proposals might be judged? How far does
the research are in which you are engaged or do the research programmes
with which you are connected fulﬁl these requirements?

once in the atmosphere. The Montreal Protocol agreement of 1987 is resulting
in the scaling down of CFC production and use in industrialised
countries
Chaos A mathematical theory describing systems that are very sensitive to the
way they are originally set up; small discrepancies in the initial conditions will
lead to completely different outcomes when the system has been in operation
for a while. For example, the motion of a pendulum when its point of
suspension undergoes forced oscillation will form a particular pattern as it
swings. Started from a slightly different position, it can form a completely
different pattern, which could not have been predicted by studying the ﬁrst one.
The weather is a partly chaotic system, which means that even with perfectly
accurate forecasting techniques, there will always be a limit to the length of
time ahead that a useful forecast can be made
CIS Commonwealth of Independent States (former USSR)

Daisyworld A model of biological feedback mechanisms developed by James
Lovelock (see also Gaia hypothesis)
DC Developing country – also Third World country
Deforestation Cutting down forests; one of the causes of the enhanced
greenhouse effect, not only when the wood is burned or decomposes, releasing
carbon dioxide, but also because the trees previously took carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere in the process of photosynthesis
Deuterium Heavy isotope of hydrogen
Drylands Areas of the world where precipitation is low and where rainfall often
consists of small, erratic, short, high-intensity storms
Ecosystem A distinct system of interdependent plants and animals, together with
their physical environment
El Nino
˜
A pattern of ocean surface temperature in the Paciﬁc off the coast of
South America, which has a large inﬂuence on world climate
Electron Negatively charged component of the atom
Element Any substance that cannot be separated by chemical means into two or
more simpler substances
Environmental refugees People forced to leave their homes because of
environmental factors such as drought, ﬂoods, sea level rise
EU European Union
Evaporation The process of changing state from liquid to gas
FAO The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
Feedbacks Factors which tend to increase the rate of a process (positive
feedbacks) or decrease it (negative feedbacks), and are themselves affected in
such a way as to continue the feedback process. One example of a positive
feedback is snow falling on the Earth’s surface, which gives a high albedo
level. The high level of reﬂected rather than absorbed solar radiation will make
the Earth’s surface colder than it would otherwise have been. This will
encourage more snow to fall, and so the process continues
Fossil fuels Fuels such as coal, oil and gas made by decomposition of ancient
animal and plant remains which give off carbon dioxide when burned
FSU Countries of the former Soviet Union
Gaia hypothesis The idea, developed by James Lovelock, that the biosphere is an
entity capable of keeping the planet healthy by controlling the physical and
chemical environment
Geoengineering Artiﬁcial modiﬁcation of the environment to counteract global
warming
Geothermal energy Energy obtained by the transfer of heat to the surface of the
Earth from layers deep down in the Earth’s crust
Global warming The idea that increased greenhouse gases cause the Earth’s
temperature to rise globally (see greenhouse effect)
Green Revolution Development of new strains of many crops in the 1960s which
increased food production dramatically
Greenhouse effect The cause of global warming. Incoming solar radiation is
transmitted by the atmosphere to the Earth’s surface, which it warms. The
energy is retransmitted as thermal radiation, but some of it is absorbed by

335

336

Glossary

molecules of greenhouse gases instead of being retransmitted out to space, thus
warming the atmosphere. The name comes from the ability of greenhouse glass
to transmit incoming solar radiation but retain some of the outgoing thermal
radiation to warm the interior of the greenhouse. The ‘natural’ greenhouse
effect is due to the greenhouse gases present for natural reasons, and is also
observed for the neighbouring planets in the solar system. The ‘enhanced’
greenhouse effect is the added effect caused by the greenhouse gases present in
the atmosphere due to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and
deforestation
Greenhouse gas emissions The release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,
causing global warming
Greenhouse gases Molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere such as carbon dioxide
(CO2 ), methane (CH4 ) and CFCs which warm the atmosphere because they
absorb some of the thermal radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface (see the
greenhouse effect)
GtC Gigatonnes of carbon (C) (1 gigatonne = 109 tonnes). 1 GtC = 3.7 Gt
carbon dioxide
GWP Global warming potential: the ratio of the enhanced greenhouse effect of
any gas compared with that of carbon dioxide
Heat capacity The amount of heat input required to change the temperature of a
substance by 1 ◦ C. Water has a high heat capacity so it takes a large amount of
heat input to give it a small rise in temperature

assessing global warming
Isotopes Different forms of an element with different atomic masses; an element
is deﬁned by the number of protons its nucleus contains, but the number of
neutrons may vary, giving different isotopes. For example, the nucleus of a
carbon atom contains six protons. The most common isotope of carbon is 12 C,
with six neutrons making up an atomic mass of 12. One of the other isotopes is
14
C, with eight neutrons, giving an atomic mass of 14. Carbon-containing
compounds such as carbon dioxide will contain a mixture of 12 C and 14 C
isotopes. See also deuterium, tritium
Latent heat The heat absorbed when a substance changes from liquid to gas
(evaporation), for example when water evaporates from the sea surface using
the Sun’s energy. It is given out when a substance changes from gas to liquid
(condensation), for example when clouds are formed in the atmosphere
Milankovitch forcing The imposition of regularity on climate change triggered
by regular changes in distribution of solar radiation (see Milankovitch theory)
Milankovitch theory The idea that major ice ages of the past may be linked with
regular variations in the Earth’s orbit around the sun, leading to varying
distribution of incoming solar radiation

Glossary

Millibar (mb) Unit of atmospheric pressure equal to hectopascal. Typical
pressure at the surface is 1000 mb
MINK Region of the United States comprising the states of Missouri, Iowa,
Nebraska and Kansas, used for a detailed climate study by the US Department
of Energy
Mole Fraction (or mixing ratio) The ratio of the number of moles of a constituent
in a given volume to the total number of moles of all constituents in that
volume. It differs from volume mixing ratio (expressed for instance in ppmv
etc.), by the corrections for non ideality of gases – that is signiﬁcant relative to
measurement precision for many greenhouse gases
Molecule Two or more atoms of one or more elements chemically combined in
ﬁxed proportions. For example, atoms of the elements carbon (C) and oxygen
(O) are chemically bonded in the proportion one to two to make molecules of
the compound carbon dioxide (CO2 ). Molecules can also be formed of a single
element, for example ozone (O3 )

of thirty countries (including the members of the European Union, Australia,
Canada, Japan and the USA) that share commitment to democratic government
and market economy
Ozone hole A region of the atmosphere over Antarctica where, during spring in
the southern hemisphere, about half the atmospheric ozone disappears
Paleoclimatology The reconstruction of ancient climates by such means as
ice-core measurements. These use the ratios of different isotopes of oxygen in
different samples taken from a deep ice ‘core’ to determine the temperature in
the atmosphere when the sample condensed as snow in the clouds. The deeper
the origin of the sample, the longer ago the snow became ice (compressed
under the weight of more snowfall)
Parameterisation In climate models, this term refers to the technique of
representing processes in terms of an algorithm (a process of step by step
calculation) and appropriate quantities (or parameters)
Passive solar design The design of buildings to maximize use of solar radiation.
A wall designed as a passive solar energy collector is called a solar wall
Photosynthesis The series of chemical reactions by which plants take in the sun’s
energy, carbon dioxide and water vapour to form materials for growth, and give
out oxygen. Anaerobic photosynthesis takes place in the absence of oxygen

Glossary

Primary energy Energy sources, such as fossil fuels, nuclear or wind power,
which are not used directly for energy but transformed into light, useful heat,
motor power and so on. For example, a coal-ﬁred power station which
generates electricity uses coal as its primary energy
Proton A positively charged component of the atomic nucleus
PV Photovoltaic: a solar cell often made of silicon which converts solar radiation
into electricity
Radiation budget The breakdown of the radiation which enters and leaves the
Earth’s atmosphere. The quantity of solar radiation entering the atmosphere
from space on average is balanced by the thermal radiation leaving the Earth’s
surface and the atmosphere
Radiative forcing The change in average net radiation at the top of the
troposphere (the lower atmosphere) which occurs because of a change in the
concentration of a greenhouse gas or because of some other change in the
overall climate system. Cloud radiative forcing is the change in the net
radiation at the top of the troposphere due to the presence of the cloud

Respiration The series of chemical reactions by which plants and animals break
down stored foods with the use of oxygen to give energy, carbon dioxide and
water vapour

atmosphere into plants via photosynthesis, or the storage of carbon dioxide in
old oil or gas wells
Sink Any process, activity or mechanism that removes a greenhouse gas, aerosol
or precursor of a greenhouse gas or aerosol from the atmosphere
Solar radiation Energy from the Sun
Sonde A device sent into the atmosphere for instance by balloon to obtain
information such as temperature and atmospheric pressure, and which sends

be cultivated rather than a treasury to be raided. (See also sustainable
development)
Stratosphere The region of the region of the atmosphere between about 10 and
50 km altitude where the temperature increases with height and where the
ozone layer is situated
Sustainable development Development which meets the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
Thermal radiation Radiation emitted by all bodies, in amounts depending on
their temperature. Hot bodies emit more radiation than cold ones
Thermodynamics The First Law of thermodynamics expresses that in any
physical or chemical process energy is conserved (i.e. it is neither created or
destroyed). The Second Law of thermodynamics states that it is not possible to
construct a device which only takes heat energy from a reservoir and turns it

Glossary

into other forms of energy or which only delivers the heat energy to another
reservoir at a different temperature. The Law further provides a formula for the
maximum efﬁciency of a heat engine which takes heat from a cooler body and
delivers it to a hotter one
Thermohaline Circulation (THC) Large-scale density driven circulation in the
ocean caused by differences in temperature and salinity
Transpiration The transfer of water from plants to the atmosphere
Tritium Radioactive isotope of hydrogen, used to trace the spread of radioactivity
in the ocean after atomic bomb tests, and hence to map ocean currents
Tropical cyclone A storm or wind system rotating around a central area of low
atmospheric pressure and occurring in tropical regions. They can be of great
strength and are also called hurricanes and typhoons. Tornadoes are much
smaller storms of similar violence
